2009-04-13,Azul Airlines customer review,9,Flew roundtrip from VCP to REC in Brazil. Easy check-in both ways. Helpful ground staff. Aircraft was a new Embraer 195 with nice light-colored interior fittings. Friendly casual crew. Usual budget airline snacks and beverages. No in-flight entertainment. Departed and arrived on time both flights. As good a flight experience as possible on a domestic budget airline.,Economy Class,4,yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2009-05-28,Azul Airlines customer review,9,Sao Paulo-Campinas to Salvador and back. Easy to use web site made booking process fast. Price was 50% less than the fare out of other Sao Paulo airports. Nice clean airport with fast efficient check in. Brand new airplane with individual seat entertainment (only in Portuguese). Onboard service simple: drinks and a selection of snacks but the crew were enthusiastic and pleasant.,Economy Class,4,yes,2,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2010-02-11,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Have flown multiple times between Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre Brazil. Excellent service friendly staff and comfortable and new planes. Website easy to use with great pricing and promotions. Also pet friendly - small pets can fly in the cabin! Best part if they fly from Rio's Santos Dumont airport - much closer and easier access than Rio's Tom Jobin Airport (GIG).,Economy Class,4,yes,3,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2011-01-25,Azul Airlines customer review,9,VCP-CWB. FA's friendly new airplanes and nice 2x2 configuration. Great price/value. The food was ok - its a low cost airline. On 30 minute flight offered 4 options of snack. Soft drinks handed in 350ml cans and the plastic cups. Onboard entertainment was zero.,Economy Class,4,yes,5,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2011-03-19,Azul Airlines customer review,8,Generally speaking they offer excellent service for flights within Brazil and are a great alternative to TAM. Flights normally on time there's a good choice of free snacks and soft drinks and if you book in advance they're good value. Their hub at VCP is very convenient if you live outside of Sao Paulo city although it's now quite crowded and specially very difficult to park.,Economy Class,4,yes,6,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2011-03-21,Azul Airlines customer review,10,VCP-SDU return. Both flights on time check easy website easy to use nice new plane with lively interior.

2011-05-21,Azul Airlines customer review,9,SDU-VCP on Embraer 190. Azul has brought to Brazilian market some items other domestic airlines had long forg0tten: good seats reasonable legroom individual IFE (satellite TV) and courteous and efficient service. New fleet of Embraer E-Jets is a plus.,Economy Class,4,yes,9,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2011-06-05,Azul Airlines customer review,8,Azul has become my first choice on Brazilian domestic flights. New Embraer ERJ 170 and ERJ 190 with personal entertainment in most of them. The leather seats are very comfortable and with good space. Just after the take-off free soft drinks and snacks are available. The crew are outstanding.,Economy Class,4,yes,10,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2011-07-06,Azul Airlines customer review,9,VCP-JPA return. The usual thing with Azul: great flight great aircraft excellent crew good IFE (not as good as international carriers but much better than other airlines flying domestic routes in Brasil). For only R$20 (about USD12.5) got an upgrade to Premium Economy and it made a great difference since it's an evening 3 hrs flight. Also the buses linking VCP (about 100km from Sao Paulo) to downtown are great and the ride probably takes less time than a taxi to GRU. Only thing that needs to improve are the snacks a sandwich (even a cold one) would fit better for long routes like this one.,Economy Class,4,yes,11,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-03-15,Azul Airlines customer review,9,SJP-VCP on ATR72. Web check-in customer friendly including seat choice. Boarding well organised and well conducted by friendly ground staff. Plane was brand new and seat pitch ok however seats are very thin and narrow. Cabin service adequate for the journey with water juices and 4 different snacks. Cabin crew were charming and flight deck informative. Here we have a case of low cost but high quality.,Economy Class,4,yes,12,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-06-04,Azul Airlines customer review,9,VCP-SJP. Although its a LCC its no nonsense approach makes it a good choice. No hidden fees no charges for beverages snacks and luggage. Check-in was fast and easy. Boarding was hassle free although VCP has no bridges and it took 10 minutes by bus to arrive at the remote position of the brand new ATR 72-600. Plane was clean and cabin crew welcoming and very courteous. Doors were closed at 18.50 and plane took off at 19.10 slightly behind schedule. Captain made announcements before take-off and came back before landing with more information. Arrival was on time. I certainly recommend Azul.,Economy Class,4,yes,13,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-06-24,Azul Airlines customer review,10,SDU-POA-SDU. Flights on time free snacks and beverages courteous and attentive cabin crew comfortable leather seats. No complaints at all would definitely fly AZUL again.,Economy Class,4,yes,14,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-08-22,Azul Airlines customer review,2,"Porte Alegre - Fortaleza (through Campinas): all flights cancelled in Porte Alegre due to fog in Campinas: that can happen but Azul had no idea how to organize this. They first had us wait 4 hours saying we would be on the next plane but a lie: no planes coming-in/going-out. They had no idea when we could fly and they just sent us away: ""maybe in 2 or 3 days try tomorrow"". Their hub in Campinas is total chaos. Only good thing is their planes are nice 2-2 seaters but that does not compensate their chaos. Don't be fooled by their cheaper rates: is not worth the delays and other mess.",Economy Class,1,no,15,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-11-14,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Ribeirao Preto to Belo Horizonte (Confins). I flew with them earlier today and was extremely impressed. I arrived at the small airport (RAO) early and got to watch 3 flights leave before mine. My flight pushed off on schedule. The flight was one of their new turboprops but it was very smooth and quiet even compared to most jet flights I have taken. Arrived 15 minutes early. Plenty of legroom. Drinks and snacks distributed promptly and efficiently. Staff very friendly. Check-in was extremely fast. Flight had no IFE but I'm pretty sure all their longer flights do (RAO-CNF is only 80 mins). One quick note. If you don't have a credit card issued in Brazil online booking or telephone booking probably not an option. Depending on your situation either swing by the airport to pay in person or book through a travel agency.,Economy Class,4,yes,16,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2013-02-07,Azul Airlines customer review,9,CNF-GRU on a E-195 pretty good quick flight and came with a simple snack very expensive due to holiday dates I also had an extra space seat which was pretty comfortable didn't want it but it was the only seat left available.,Economy Class,1,yes,17,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2013-03-08,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Round trip from Porto Alegre (POA) to Curitiba (CWB). Surprised with the high quality of services offered knowing it is a low-cost carrier. I spent R$240 (US$120) for the trip including all taxes. Check-in was very fast less than 5 minutes the plane was always on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier than scheduled (on both legs). The plane an Embraer E195 (in both legs) was pretty quiet and Azul offered TV in real time with a lot of channels. Very clean and I liked the scheme 2-2 seats. Snacks (4 options) and drinks (5 options) offered FA's were polite and friendly. I will certainly fly Azul again.,Economy Class,4,yes,19,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2013-03-19,Azul Airlines customer review,10,AD 4313/4002 SJP-VCP-SDU. Brand new AT7 on SJP-VCP sector and E90 on the VCP SDU sector that included live TV adequate legroom and seat width free snacks served by smiling welcoming crews. Both flights left and arrived on time not even 15 minutes delays unusual by most standards anywhere. Luggage (no charges too) was delivered shortly after we were inside the terminal.,Economy Class,5,yes,20,4,5,4,5,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2013-05-06,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Flew VCP-GIG-VCP and VCP-IGU-VCP. Very nice check-in staff. They even located an agent that spoke English to assist me with my flight. All segments left timely or early. All planes were well maintained. Flight attendants were friendly and professional. Unlimited snacks and drinks offered. Baggage delivered very fast. My only other comment is that all in-flight announcements were in Portuguese. However I found most flight attendants did speak some English and were eager to assist. US airlines could learn from Azul on how to provide good and friendly customer service!,Economy Class,5,yes,21,5,5,5,N/A,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2013-12-03,Azul Airlines customer review,9,I used Azul airlines for a round trip from Sao Paolo to Rio de Janeiro. Due to the fact I booked one day before the flight I guess a paid a little bit more than usual: ca. 550 for 2 people with 23kg luggage each. The aircraft was well equipped - TV screen for every seat where you could choose several tv channels (only some in English) and quite a lot of space for the legs for a small aircraft. The staff were friendly. They only serve a drink and a snack (cookies or nuts) on the flight but it was only a 1hr flight. Our flight was a little bit delayed but that is quite normal (esp in Brazil). I'd like to make an additional service about their customer service: we had to change our flight back on the day of the flight to not miss our flight after and their service was brilliant! They booked us on another earlier flight and didn't charge us for that change! This is really customer friendly.,Economy Class,N/A,yes,25,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2014-07-06,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Belo Horizonte (CND) to Montes Claros (MOC) on flight AD5028 Embraer 195. My travel begins with a fast reservation on website. Easy and objective. The onboard service is another differential of Azul. When boarding you are always welcomed with a big smile from the flights attendants. The ATR-72 have no entertainment onboard because usually the route is regional and it is fast but onboard the EMB-195 you can enjoy excellent individual entertainment. The comfortable is another differential of Azul. All aircraft's have just double seats.,Economy Class,N/A,yes,28,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2015-02-11,Azul Airlines customer review,8,Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo. Brand new Embraer 195 with personal screens on every seat and live TV with a broad selection of movies sports channels and news. Cabin crew is friendly and well-groomed. Flight time was 55 minutes. Snacks (cookies chips and pretzels) along with water juices and spirits were distributed free of charge. Announcements and safety information/instructions were held in Portuguese only: in my opinion they should be in English too. Overall a nice experience. Ticket fare was very low considering the peak season (beginning of February). I usually fly TAM for domestic flights within Brazil but as of now I will consider Azul as a valid alternative option.,Economy Class,N/A,yes,29,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2015-10-05,"""had to pay for the flight twice""",3,"We travel in Brazil and internationally quite a bit sometimes from within Brazil and sometimes from abroad. If you plan to use a non-Brasilian credit or debit card in Brasil, the golden rule is make sure it is 'unlocked' for use in Brasil for the period in use or they may likely decline it for security reasons (we use both, but our business card is a UK one). But what if you don't notice that it is going through Brasilian verification? Online it usually makes no difference: this time it did. I booked a flight with Azul, which I've done many times. The booking went through but they said there was a small problem on the card which was not unlocked. I phoned Mastercard and made sure it was unlocked. The Azul confirmation came through again, saying the payment and flight was confirmed. Mastercard also said that that specific payment had been confirmed when I spoke to them. The next day, an email arrived from Azul saying there is a problem. I spend an hour on the phone with them but the upshot is that they said they had refunded the amount (this later turned out to be untrue) because of the initial problem. They asked me to send email photographs of the front of my credit card and passport (which in itself breaks Internet security protocols and their agreements with Mastercard). They assured me that was the only way to sort it out and it would all be confirmed and sorted out in thirty minutes so reluctantly I sent them. Two hours and more long distance phone calls later, the person who had made the promise had gone home and the new person said the flight would have to be paid for again and not with that card (there is nothing wrong with the card). Now I know the airline gurus on here will say, Oh it's all your fault, you should have done such-and-such, but the mistakes or problems I encountered (as someone who books many flights) could happen to anyone, which is why I am sharing the story. So when the offices open again I phone Mastercard again. They tell that the payment was definitely approved (and supplied the authorisation code) and that the transaction had definitely gone through (and provided me with the transaction code) and that it definitely had not been refunded. I asked if there was a refund pending and they said there was not any refund pending. When confronted with this, they (Azul) changed their story and said it hadn't been refunded but it would be refunded once the payment was made in person at their office. This required my partner to take several hours off, take a taxi from Sao Paulo to Barueri (where the Azul office is situated, a journey of about 25km with tolls and heavy traffic that can take over an hour) and pay cash for something that they, Azul, had already received cash for and still had cash for. (Presumably if we had accepted them at their word, that the money had been refunded, and just changed to a flight with TAM, bearing in mind this is two days before travel, they would not have refunded it at all.) The other 'option' they offered was for my partner to take the money to the airport and pay for the flight and that they would refund the money to the credit card after she had done so. (The first option meant lost time and expense, the second one arriving at the airport without a guaranteed flight carrying more money than is desirable when travelling around.) We decided we had few choices but to pay for the flight twice in the hope that the money will eventually be refunded and an e-ticket issued.",Economy Class,2,no,33,3,3,,,,Business,Sao Paulo to Sao Luis,October 2015,1,1,Azul,Brazil
2015-10-28,"""very professional and attentive""",6,Took 3 flights with Azul within 3 days. All flights were boarded and disembarked via a bus which is annoying. On board the FA's were very professional and attentive. There were drinks and a wide range of snacks offered on all flights. The seats were comfortable and all flights left and arrived on time. The only complaint I have is that all announcements including the safety brief were in Portuguese only.

In general, the onboard service was average to good throughout. My problem was with the check-in staff at Belo Horizonte who did not speak English and were not well oriented to international ticketing and baggage handling. Furthermore, the transfer from the domestic terminal to the international terminal at Sao Paulo Viracopos was particularly unorganized, leaving the passenger to figure out how to get from point a to point b. Surprisingly, even at Viracopos finding assistance from English speaking airline staff was a challenge.

2016-03-02,"""really care about customers""",9,"I read reviews stating that Azul was better, however, when checking discount sites, GOL was on average $200 less, and thus is what we went for on our first 2 flights. Our third and 4th flight, was going to be Azul. Azul was by far, way more friendly and customer service oriented than GOL. Unfortunately, as we had booked our tickets on a discount site, we were not easily able to get our tickets changed to an earlier flight - but when we got to the airport 3 hours earlier than planned in Cuiaba, the check in clerk let a translator know that there were seats open on a flight that would get us into Iguacu at midnight instead of 6am. Unfortunately because of the discount site, we did not qualify to do so. But the fact that a company would go out of its way to do this for us is awesome in my opinion. It shows that as a company, they really care about their customers! The only downside (which was shared with GOL) that you should be aware of, is that if you have a connecting flight of more than 4 hours you will need to pick up your luggage and re-check it in. Mind you, the first time we experienced this was with GOL and they had not warned us that this was going to happen. When we were checking in with Azul, they told us that when we reached our 2nd connection as we were going to be there for 6 hours, we would need to pick up our luggage and then check it back in 2hrs before our flight. Another great thing is that (at least at this point in time) most of their staff seemed to know English, which is very very helpful for travelers that aren't from Portugal or Brazil. I am not sure of what other languages they may or may not know. But it was very comforting actually being able to understand somebody. The last thing, and I am not sure whether this is supposed to be standard practice, or if we just got lucky on 5 flights, is that they had a wide selection of snacks on-board. and you didnt have to pick just one. If you wanted one of each of the 5 selections, they would make sure that you got one of each.",Economy Class,4,yes,40,3,5,5,3,,Solo Leisure,CGB to IGU,February 2016,5,,Azul,Brazil

Once I told them I had a connection they promptly put me in another fly with another company (Gol). That another company flight also delay because of intense traffic (no company fault). We arrive in San Paulo, but was already late and we lost our connection. We talk with Azul and explained the situation. Without any need for discuss, they promptly bring us to a hotel, everything paid. Then they gave us a letter witch we showed to Etihad so they put us on a flight on the next day. Azul were very nice and helpful. I will definitely fly again because I know that if I need they are going to be helpful.

2017-02-13,"""it really surprised me""",10,"â Verified Review |  I always fly with Azul Airlines here in Brazil, but I decided to write about this specific flight due to the special circumstances. I was flying from Campinas to FloranÃ³polis and when arriving at the destination, we were informed that there was a storm over FlorianÃ³polis. After spending some time over the surroundings expecting for a window to land, the pilot decided to abort the landing and continue to it's final destination which was Porto Alegre. Due to the impossibility to land in FlorianÃ³polis, and since it was night, Azul booked hotel rooms to the passengers, organized the transport, included meals and booked a return flight 6 am in the morning. Everything was well organized and well informed to avoid uncertainty between the passengers. I see the ability to deal with exceptions like this in a company way more important than superfluous in-flight meals or little threats. Not that Azul doesn't have it, but it really surprised me under such circumstance.",Economy Class,4,yes,47,5,5,3,5,,Solo Leisure,VCP to FLN,October 2016,5,,Azul,Brazil
2017-03-05,"""customer service was useless""",5,"â Verified Review |  Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon via Viracopos. Online booking magically booked a connecting flight departing earlier than my flight arrival. Luckly I managed to get it corrected before the fight date. Domestic leg from Rio de Janeiro SDU to Viracopos/Campinas was confortable with average service. Bagagge check was ok, no priority tags for business class with bags dispatched all the way to Lisbon. Onboard baggage allowance of one item up to 5 kilos was ridiculous. Boarding in Viracopos was confusing due to deficient signage. Business class full flat seats were very confortable, pillows were clean and smelled good. Meal service was average, no seconds offered even on water. Coffee only if requested but flight atendants vanished right after service was somewhat considered complete. More like economy business than full business. In flight entertainment was ok but could do with noise suppressing phones.  One checked suitcase did not arrive. Azul customer service was useless. Even after it arrived later on a TAP flight from Salvador, we were told in writing it was not their problem and that we should have a solution in the next 5 days.

2017-06-05,"""a high standard""",9,"â Verified Review | Just back from a short trip from Curitiba to Sao Paulo Congonhas and I really feel I must acknowledge the efforts of Azul Airlines that really goes the extra mile. While I find flying in Brazil to generally be of a high standard, what sets Azul apart is the sense of style, staff that really seem to get a kick out of their jobs and the impressively fast baggage claim. I'd travel more with this company if they flew more of the routes I travel on. Keep up the good work.",Economy Class,5,yes,49,5,5,4,,E195,Business,Curitiba to Sao Paulo Congonhas,June 2017,5,,Azul,Brazil
