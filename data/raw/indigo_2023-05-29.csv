2009-12-19,IndiGo customer review,7,DEL-PNQ. Flight on time. Nice and clean aircraft. Wide range of snacks available for purchase though rates were exorbitant. The only negative point would be air hostesses being less interactive and involved.,Economy Class,4,yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-03-19,IndiGo customer review,8,BLR-BOM on the early morning flight. Cabin was clean. FAs attentive and courteous. We had pre-booked snacks and served a good Veg Sandwich and juice. Quite good. Other choices too were available.,Economy Class,4,yes,2,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-06-08,IndiGo customer review,8,BDQ-HYD via BOM. The check-in at Vadodara was smooth though they did not give me through check in to Hyderabad. I had to claim my luggage and re-check in at Mumbai but it was smooth. Ground staff courteous and efficient. Aircraft clean cabin crew efficient and courteous. Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic. Overall not bad at all.,Economy Class,4,yes,3,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-06-29,IndiGo customer review,9,DEL-CCU-DEL. Full flight outbound but seated in front row which was good. No queues at checkin nice crew cheerful and professional. Flight left on time and landed early - baggage was off within a few minutes wait. Coming back slightly less good check in experience - at airport several hours early after arriving in international - wouldn't let us check in until 2 hours before departure. When asked for front row seats were told we'd have to pay - got it free on outbound guess I was lucky! Flight crew again cheerful and attentive. Flight was early again bags took about 20 mins but that's par for the course in Delhi. Inflight food not paid and ok value for money.,Economy Class,4,yes,4,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-06-30,IndiGo customer review,6,Kolkata-Jaipur route on time clean aircraft and nice crew. One bad thing about this airline is that they do not even serve water at free. Snacks were expensive outside foods are allowed.,Economy Class,4,yes,5,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-07-04,IndiGo customer review,8,Kolkata to Guwahati and Kolkata to Bangalore. Check-in okay not too friendly. Aircraft were new so cabins kept clean. Seats okay. Cabin crew better than ground crew. Cheap tickets. The only complaint is that the food is expensive - INR 150 for chicken sandwich is too much considering it's just a 2 piece sandwich which you can get for INR 50 at super-markets. The great thing about IndiGo is the on-time performance.,Economy Class,4,yes,6,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-07-21,IndiGo customer review,9,Bangalore to Mumbai good quality from this budget airline. Flight on time leg room good and boarding a breeze. I will use IndiGo Airlines as it is value for money.,Economy Class,4,yes,7,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-08-17,IndiGo customer review,8,Pune to Nagpur return. Smooth efficient check in. Flight 80 minutes with breakfast you can buy onboard. Due to turbulence the cart never got to where we were. Staff very pleasant. Return trip late evening flight. Delayed by 45 mins but managed to do a quick turn around and got us to Pune on time.,Economy Class,4,yes,8,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-09-07,IndiGo customer review,9,DEL-CCU-DEL NAG-DEL a few times and happy to take IndiGo. The seat pitch makes me feel a little cramped at times but otherwise is excellent. The crew is courteous and always ready to help.,Economy Class,4,yes,9,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-10-08,IndiGo customer review,10,MUM-DEL. Excellent service - paid Rs300 for the front row which if you're my size is worth it! Inflight food is on a pay basis nothing special but it's good size portions and not bonkers expensive. Great inflight crew cheerful and engaging brand new planes. My first choice now for domestic Indian flights.,Economy Class,4,yes,10,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2010-12-30,IndiGo customer review,10,Return flights from Goa to Delhi the experience was enjoyable with efficient checking in friendly and polite cabin crew and new air planes.,Economy Class,4,yes,11,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2011-01-24,IndiGo customer review,9,Return flights from Goa to Delhi the experience was enjoyable with efficient checking in DEL-BOM. An efficient airline which prides itself at being on time with helpful air and ground crews. New clean aircraft - just one grouse though a low cost carrier it would be great if the leg space was better. I am about 6 feet tall and it becomes uncomfortable in case of flights which are over an hour or so.,Economy Class,4,yes,12,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2011-02-04,IndiGo customer review,9,Connection at Madras to Hyderabad (coming from US) and back to Madras connecting to US. Both trips an hour long each. Ground Staff helpful at both ends cabin crew charming and helpful. A320 clean and comfortable ample room in overhead bins. Remembering yester-years of Indian Airlines service attitude it is amazing what the open market brought to traveling Indian public.,Economy Class,4,yes,13,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2011-02-17,IndiGo customer review,8,Bombay-Jaipur return Pune-Nagpur. Easy check in and nice friendly staff in Bombay. On the return (Jaipur to Bombay) we were asked to carry no hand baggage onboard as it was a high security day. The airline could have informed us earlier as had breakable stuff in my hand baggage and they forced me to check it in. Pune to Nagpur efficient and competent crew.,Economy Class,4,yes,14,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2011-06-23,IndiGo customer review,10,BLR-DEL return trip. Had a good experience yet again. The flights took had a timely pushback. Onward journey a bit delayed due to bad weather at BLR and the pilot had to change the takeoff runaway direction. Crew courteous and got my pre booked food. Return journey was uneventful as well. Will surely continue flying Indigo.,Economy Class,4,yes,15,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2011-09-30,IndiGo customer review,8,Mumbai-Bangalore. Flight on time great service from airport check-in to end stage. Well planned and executed model for passenger satisfaction. Taken to the aircraft by bus this afternoon flight was full yet the flight attendants were calm and courteous. They worked seamlessly with an almost natural smile. Aircraft clean. Onboard options for food were plenty though slightly pricey.,Economy Class,4,yes,16,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2011-11-18,IndiGo customer review,8,Kolkata to Hyderabad. Check-in staff pleasant. Cabin crew professional and courteous. Aircraft clean but seats very tight. For a 2-hour flight the low price was more important than seat comfort.,Economy Class,4,yes,17,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2011-12-14,IndiGo customer review,8,Did BOM-MAA once and doing my second today. Great crew. Very helpful at check-in. Courteous onboard and new aircraft's. Only hitch is food. While ticket rates are on par with Jet and AI particularly after KF problems one has to buy food and that too from a limited choice. Pre-booking is there but the website does not guide as to how.,Economy Class,4,yes,18,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2011-12-28,IndiGo customer review,8,DEL-BKK on newly introduced international service by Indigo. Clean aircraft everything BOB on time and professional crew. Not very different from domestic services the only difference that food is priced in USD. The highlight was great value fare booked well in advance.,Economy Class,4,yes,19,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-01-05,IndiGo customer review,9,BBI-DEL. Flight slightly delayed due to late departure at Delhi. Seated next to the exit no recline for the seat and the other passenger behind! Aircraft was clean although some parts broken. There were huge selections of snacks and beverages. Although the water comes in such a tiny glass you have to pay for it. Cabin Crew friendly and with a natural smile. Overall this airline is professional.,Economy Class,4,yes,20,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-01-05,IndiGo customer review,7,BOM-DEL-BOM. Boarding was swift and passengers greeted by friendly cabin crew. The flight left on time and the service friendly with enough information was given by FA's. The flight on second leg was one hour late and IndiGo did manage to reach out passengers by sending SMS. Again friendly crew and clear information from FA's. The only downside is the food could be tastier. The food sold inflight has absolute no value of money and leg space is poor for an 188 cm man. I had to fit in and sit in slanting positing.,Economy Class,4,yes,21,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-01-28,IndiGo customer review,3,"Airline staff at Ahmedabad were unprofessional and non-committal. Flight to Bangalore from Ahmedabad scheduled at 5 pm was delayed more than 3 hours and the behaviour of ground staff was irresponsible. As the expected time neared and no trace of the aircraft was seen the answer I got from ground staff was ""we don't know"". Arrival at Bangalore airport was chaotic. It took ground staff more than 40 minutes to put the baggage on the carrousel. Passengers arriving on other airlines were exiting the terminal before our baggage was even on the carrousel. Indigo was my preferred airline until my previous trip - a very steep deterioration in quality.",Economy Class,1,no,22,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-02-06,IndiGo customer review,9,Kolkata-Chennai-Pune leg. The airline offers a very good product with excellent staff to go with it. The aircraft is well-maintained and the staff know what they are offering. They are a low-cost carrier however they don't cut corners on security and service.,Economy Class,4,yes,23,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-02-28,IndiGo customer review,9,BKK-BOM-BKK. Friendly crew. Check-in both in BKK and BOM easy. Food onboard was very expensive compared to Air Asia. I always carry snacks. Water free. Plane 2/3 full. Everything was so hassle-free that I have already booked two more flights on this route for May and October at the same price.,Economy Class,4,yes,24,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-03-02,IndiGo customer review,8,Flew from Mumbai to Chennai on February 23rd 2012. Enjoyed the experience and was impressed with the service and the inflight magazine.,Economy Class,4,yes,25,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-03-09,IndiGo customer review,,SIN-DEL The flight was awful. I asked for an exit row seat and got the seat in front of exit row which did not recline. Had to sit upright for 6 hours. Babies hollering and crying everywhere. No food or drink unless you buy - they should at least serve a sandwich on an international flight - what does it cost? 50 cents?,Economy Class,1,no,26,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2012-04-04,IndiGo customer review,2,BOM-LKO. Flew on Indigo thrice and all 3 flights were delayed. Paid extra to book seat of choice and meal. Check-in staff extremely rude and unfriendly. Cabin was not as clean as they rave about. Inflight cabin service without a smile. Only cold meals served. They also charge for wheelchairs with fares comparable to full service carriers. Not my choice and not recommended. Very pricey for a 'low cost airline'.,Economy Class,1,no,28,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-04-29,IndiGo customer review,9,Bangalore to Delhi return. Ground staff and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. The planes used also were new clean and comfortable. The food too was pretty good. However it is better that they sell at least a water bottle. Although they do sell water they provide it in paper cups and every time I had to pay Rs 40.,Economy Class,4,yes,29,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-05-30,IndiGo customer review,5,Bangkok-Delhi. Plane was new though no inflight entertainment which most of them have. No food or beverage unless you buy. For a flight of 4.30 hours strange thing. A cup of premixed tea cost 100 THB (INR 170.00).,Economy Class,1,no,30,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-07-15,IndiGo customer review,7,"MAA-HYD. The crews are friendly the airplanes clean they still run a largely on-time operation and prices remain very affordable. The bad news is the pains associated with flying ""ultra low cost carriers"" are now beginning to inflict the airline. Seat selection was free the last time I flew them a couple of years ago but now they charge Rs. 100 per passenger. They also charge Rs. 50 to get a copy of your e-ticket at the airport. Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment. Even worse if you have to make a change to your reservation the ""convenience fee"" is charged every time you make a change. IndiGo is unfortunately picking up the bad habits of the Spirits and Ryanairs of the world though at least the service is very good for now anyway.",Economy Class,4,yes,31,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-08-06,IndiGo customer review,3,Dehli-Kathmandu-Dehli. Unfriendly staff they ask you to be at the airport 4 hours before departure for international flights and 2 hours for domestic flights. Arrived 3.5 hours early as anticipated no check-in counter was open. Nevertheless the plane seemed to be quite new and comfortable.,Economy Class,1,no,32,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-08-07,IndiGo customer review,10,Goa to Mumbai on Sunday 5-8-2012. On time and welcomed by smiling crew. The plane was spotless and new. The food was reasonably priced and good. Short flight of 55 minutes. At the end the Pilot came out of the cabin to say goodbye to everybody.,Economy Class,4,yes,33,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-08-08,IndiGo customer review,7,Overall a good experience from HYD-BLR-HYD and HYD-DEL. Planes are new and modern crew all young pleasant and helpful and speak perfect English. Seating is very tight - the person in from of me reclined their seat and it was in my face. They sell food which is tasty and well priced. One major negative as at check in at HYD. My company bought my ticket in the US and they asked me to produce the credit card. As I could not they denied me boarding until I bought another ticket which was very frustrating and almost caused me to miss the flight. They gave me an email print out for a refund but this is certainly not up to international standards.,Economy Class,4,yes,34,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-09-05,IndiGo customer review,8,DEL-COK-DEL. Excellent flight both flights on time as we had pre-booked meals and seats check-in was a breeze. Overall highly recommended as a premium low cost carrier.,Economy Class,4,yes,35,,,,,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2012-10-17,IndiGo customer review,9,BOM-BDQ on A320. Check-in was not as efficient as I have know Indigo to have. But it was not a problem. We were kept waiting for take-off due to congestion but flight itself was pretty standard efficient Indigo.

In Mumbai the bags were out in ten minutes. Indigo made flying fun from Cabin Crew with their Leading Lady and Miss Indigo badges the aircraft steps had painted on the side ""Here comes the hot stepper"". The sandwiches to purchase in a box that said ""airwich"" even the cashew nuts came in a collectable tin which said ""Nut Case"" on it.",Economy Class,5,yes,39,5,5,5,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2012-12-12,IndiGo customer review,10,Flew Kolkata-Bangalore via Chennai. Flight departed on time the aircraft despite being one of their older ones was clean and well-maintained.

2012-12-25,IndiGo customer review,,I travelled from Bangalore to Jaipur. The leg space between seats was the length of my iPad. If the seat in front is reclined it would hit you face.

2013-01-08,IndiGo customer review,10,For the first time my husband and I travelled with Indigo airlines 2 days ago and were very sceptical as it was a budget airline and we had slightly excess baggage. To our surprise from our very first contact with the Indigo airline staff to the end of our trip we were impressed. The lovely young lady at Mumbai airport greeted us with pleasantries checked in our luggage which was a bit above the limit. Once on board on our flight to Singapore we found the seats spacious and comfortable the crew courteous and professional. The inflight service was excellent and reasonably priced. We purchased some spiced chai and cookies that came beautifully packaged in a tin. Regular announcements by the crew were clear and polite. Would gladly travel Indigo Airlines again and highly recommend it.,Economy Class,5,yes,43,5,5,5,5,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2013-02-03,IndiGo customer review,10,I was supposed to fly from Delhi to Mumbai this morning (10.25am) on Indigo but Delhi airport was heavily fogged out and the runway operations had been shut for a few hours. I was not informed of any impending cancellations or delays and proceeded to the airport a normal. Upon arrival I was very politely informed that no departures had taken place this day and Indigo were unsure when departures would take place. They immediately asked me if I would like to take the first available flight on the day but because of the fog and my return on the same evening I declined and requested them if they could delay and reschedule this by a few days later which they happily and professionally did at no extra cost or dreaded penalties. The whole affair was so well handled I was most impressed by Indigo's ground staff. This is one rare gem in the Indian aviation scene.,Economy Class,5,yes,45,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2013-03-14,IndiGo customer review,9,I flew with Indigo in August 2012. Given the hype about this airline I thought of giving them a try and they didn't disappoint. Website was easy to use. However I wish they'd allow pre-booking of seats at least for a nominal fee. You have to buy 'Indigo Plus' which is meals + seat so if you don't want a meal there will be no seat selection. Aircraft was an A320 and it was in excellent condition. Cabin crew was polite and friendly. Food is available for sale and water is provided in cups free of charge. However there isn't much space between the seats and does feel a little cramped.,Economy Class,5,yes,48,4,4,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2013-04-11,IndiGo customer review,8,Used Indigo BOM-TRV for the first time main reason was no other suitable alternative available. The aircraft was spotless looked brand new and the crew attentive and very polite. Legroom is very limited but I knew that before so I can't complain and for a 2 hour flight I could survive it. Tasty snacks were sold at reasonable prices on board. Flight was on time.,Economy Class,4,yes,49,2,5,4,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2013-04-21,IndiGo customer review,9,New Delhi to Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi. Only Indigo has a direct flight in this sector at the time of writing. The flight experience was very good. Fare was cheap as booked early online selected the meal plus seating combination- Indigo Plus. Check-in and boarding was efficient flight departed and reached destination on time as per schedule. Though selected a standard seat on row 3the legroom was very comfortable. The aircraft was new and interior was clean. The only bad thing was the pre booked food booked online wasn't up to expected quality. Not sure whether its because we ordered vegetarian meal.,Economy Class,4,yes,50,4,4,2,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

They managed to turnaround the aircraft in 20 minutes. Saw passengers disembarking from the previous flight at the same time when we were bussed to the aircraft which I thought was quite amazing.

From the moment we arrived at T3 Delhi IGI our every need was met and every question answered with professionalism and friendliness. The ground handling staff member was very friendly and knowledgeable the check in staff at Delhi were very friendly and helpful and the crew of 6E21 provided service that cannot be faulted.

2013-10-07,IndiGo customer review,8,If you are looking to enjoy a comfortable flight then look no further than Indigo. I am quite fussy about my travelling because of which I have completely put my faith in Indigo Airlines. I love the fact that the flights are punctual and the passengers are not made to wait. The flight attendants welcome you with a warm smile and make you feel comfortable. The flights are well maintained and the washrooms are also hygienic. The crew and the management have certainly done a wonderful job in keeping their patrons happy and satisfied. There was plenty of legroom available on-board even though my flight was full. If you are planning to travel with elderly people then do not worry. The staff are extremely friendly. This airline has always been my preference over others.

2013-10-13,IndiGo customer review,9,BLR-BOM return. On time departure arrival before scheduled time for both flights. Smooth check-in process and assignment of seats. Clean and spotless aircraft's legroom a bit limited though. Cabin crew very efficient and lot of smiles. Masala tea bought on board was tasty. Bus rides between gates and aircraft. On return leg we were transiting from SIN (different airline) and had excess baggage. They just checked the boarding passes for the international leg and did not charge anything extra as baggage fees!,Economy Class,5,yes,65,3,4,4,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2013-10-15,IndiGo customer review,10,Delhi-Bangkok-Delhi. New A320 aircraft's were clean. Since it is a budget airline they are very particular about checked in baggage and charge for every extra kilo. Even some passengers were nasty the flight attendants were friendly.

You get what you pay for and you know what you're paying for and Indigo delivered to a T and with aplomb. New clean airy decor aircraft lovely FAs. And a lovely touch that others could copy: no jetway but instead of steps up they have a ramp so it's easy to get rollers up to the plane. Spent half an hour on the ground at Cochi during which the cabin was well-cleaned (lavatories included) and properly vacuumed.

The service started late and then the crew were serving/selling in each row going back to front rows serving water discussing menu options with those buying and chatting amongst themselves. On other airlines food is first served to those who pre-book. After selling to all they don't have many items left for serving. Suggest they keep the standard menu and serve pre booked passengers first.,Economy Class,3,no,69,4,1,1,2,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2014-01-02,IndiGo customer review,3,I flew from Pune to Bangalore on 30th December 2013 on Flt 6E 407. I bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful! I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals. When I asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like I'd asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo. This is the first time I've been on the receiving end of aloof treatment from Indigo staff.,Economy Class,3,no,72,4,1,1,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2014-01-13,IndiGo customer review,8,"MAA-DEL. It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.",Economy Class,5,yes,73,3,5,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

The flight duration to Delhi is 150 minutes. I wanted to have my breakfast on the flight I was waiting with my purse in my hand. The air hostesses were slow and inefficient to say the least.

2014-02-20,IndiGo customer review,1,I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs.

2014-03-05,IndiGo customer review,8,Last week I flew from BOM to Goa and return. Both flights were slightly delayed (ca 15 mins) but the quality of the service has compensated for these minor delays. The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them. This flight is really short- ca 37 mins from take-off to touch-down so not much time to offer paid (or pre-paid) meals.

I am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on Goa - Ahmedabad flight on 27th February. It was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. The onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. The passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. I was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. There was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. When we landed at Ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. We were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. It was first time I had travelled Indigo who boast of their punctuality.

Only problem was that out first booking had not actually been confirmed despite us having a booking number. I received nothing from Indigo to tell me this and I missed the small print on my booking. With an 30 minutes to spare a very helpful groundstaff person went to a lot of trouble to get us new bookings and got us the last seats on our flight.

Seat was fairly ok but if you are a large person you will feel very uncomfortable as the armrests on this airline did not go up. After take off we were offered drinks despite Indigo being a budget airline. I felt a little hungry halfway through the flight and I manger to get a packet of chips for a cheap price. After which we landed in Pune fresh and nourished. Overall Indigo I feel has service that is better than any other budget airline that I knew.,Economy Class,5,yes,84,3,4,3,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

All staff were very friendly professional and helpful the planes were modern and spotless the captain gave informative and friendly announcements before during and after the flight the food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced; and the inflight magazine was well-produced. In Delhi we got stuck in a traffic jam caused by a sudden storm and so we only arrived at the aiport about 10 minutes before the flight. We assumed that we would miss the flight and have to make a plan B but the excellent and helpful staff quickly issued us boarding passes and rushed us to the plane so we still got away on time.,Economy Class,5,yes,86,4,5,4,5,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2014-10-12,IndiGo customer review,1,Flight 6E 473 from Mumbai to Bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 HRS due to weather conditions en-route to Bangalore. However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay.,Economy Class,1,no,88,4,1,1,1,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

We eventually got to Bangalore airspace and ended up circling for 20 minutes or more until the captain announced that the thunderstorm had passed and we could land before our fuel situation worsened.

Total weight 11 kgs. Got the shock of my life when they said that they wouldn't allow more than 7 Kgs in cabin including laptop. Now I had a laptop and charger. Then I had a SLR Camera with lenses plus a change of clothes and some files. They asked me to pack all the fragile items into one bag and check-in the other. Imagine my situation. There was no way I could fit all the fragile items into one bag and weigh in at less than 7 kgs. I checked-in the bag and nothing was damaged. On to other aspects of the flight. The seats are cramped and the seat back is very thin. You feel the knees of the guy behind you! The food they sell is mediocre. If you want on time performance then probably this LCC is the best in India. But if you want customer friendly service comfortable seats good food or in-flight entertainment (none exists on Indigo aircraft's) or for that matter a reasonable cabin baggage policy then do look elsewhere.",Economy Class,4,no,90,2,4,3,1,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2014-12-01,IndiGo customer review,10,Flew from Poona to Calcutta and then a connection again IndiGo to Bangkok. Both flights virtually flawless. Have to always commend the cabin crew on their providing a comfortable flight. Noticed something new this time: on deplaning one of the cockpit staff emerges to join the cabin crew in bidding adieu. I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor). Maybe IndiGo can have a staff member on the ground floor to assist arriving IndiGo passengers transferring to departures and carrying heavy luggage?,Economy Class,5,yes,93,4,5,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

Whilst we could not check in online with young children for some reason the check in staff ensured we were allotted the seats we requested. Staff were also flexible with us checking in most of our luggage (and exceeding the 15kg/person) instead of taking a carry on bag for each of the children making our lives easier. Bags were delivered even before we reached the belt in both cases. Streets ahead of Easyjet and Ryanair.

2015-02-24,IndiGo customer review,2,Was travelling from Dubai to Mumbai. I was fond of Indigo before this trip. Check-in was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. However got some shopping from the Duty free. As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach.,Economy Class,2,no,100,3,1,3,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2015-04-16,IndiGo customer review,6,DEL-PNQ(Pune)-DEL. December 2014. Worst possible time of the year to fly out of Delhi. Had horrible experiences due to the fog. The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.,Economy Class,4,yes,104,4,2,3,2,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2015-05-29,IndiGo customer review,3,We were supposed to board our flight from Delhi to Lucknow at 12.15 on the 21st of May but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation. Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle.,Economy Class,2,no,106,3,4,3,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India
2015-06-07,IndiGo customer review,,"6E189 6th June. Low budget Airline - their fares are more or less the same if not more at times than full service carriers yet they continue to enjoy all the subsidies of a low budget airline. On time is a good thing - their flights are often now delayed or run late. Check-in process - everyone knows how long the queues are at the check in counters. Two days back on 4th June I did Web Check in for my 6th June flight using my smartphone. While I was successful in doing web check-in in spite of me giving the email address and phone no I did not get a copy of the boarding pass - beating the while process of doing Web check-in. At Delhi T1 terminal when I tried to print my boarding pass at the Check in Kiosk while it displayed the Boarding Pass I did not get my print out! On taking it up with the ground staff I got a casual reply - please stand in the queue even though I mentioned that the flight was due to board in next 35 minutes he simply refused to help me. As a result I reached the counter just 30 minutes before the departure of the flight and the check in lady commented ""Sir you are very late please be on time next time""! I have booked 3 tickets for my family through on-line booking system. After I had filled in all the passenger details I was asked whether I would like to take the pre-assigned seats facility and I declined and continued with my booking. But to my surprise and disappointment I found seats were allotted together that included an aisle and window seat along with the middle seat. When I tried to change the seats it did not allow me and charged me Rs 400 extra (Rs 200 each for Window and Aisle 'premium' seats) over and above the fare and there was no way I could change it.",Economy Class,2,no,107,3,2,1,N/A,,,,,,,IndiGo,India

2015-06-20,IndiGo customer review,8,"I recently took several flights with IndiGo and didn't experience any major issues. I checked other airlines before I booked and IndiGo were consistently cheaper, often by a wide margin. Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out.

2017-05-21,"""comfort might be a difficulty""",4,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again?

With Indigo, you have to pay for food if you are flying economy, I ordered coffee and a Tandoori chicken Sandwich. From my judgement, the cost was a bit much for food of that quality. The sandwich was cold. You even have to call flight attendants for water every time, which in my opinion, would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle.

As always exemplary cabin service, efficient check in service. This time had a harrowing experience that the airline handled with aplomb: I checked in and was asked if I had a PowerPac in my luggage and I said no. While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board! A exemplary and totally extraordinary performance by an IndiGo employee who stayed with me during the entire ordeal. Many many thanks.

They offered me to book in the next flight to Vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference, but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us (as we were tired of traveling from SFO and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible). There was a flight to Ahmedabad at 7:40 am and we urged the Indigo staff to book us in that flight. They mentioned that the 'sector' (i.e. destination) was different and therefore the change fees would be higher. I said no issue as we were really in hurry. There was another problem though. That flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 6:20 am. The indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if I would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight, I would lose more money. They offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1. But with little time, we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi. We barely reached to Terminal at 6:35 am. We had to get our tickets modified, checked in and boarding passes printed by 6:40 am to get into the Ahemdabad flight. That is when we met staff who had just joined her duties at the terminal 1 ticket counter and saw us coming with family in agitated state. I requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get Ahmedabad flight. She immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed. In couple of minutes we had our tickets in hand and we rushed to the terminal 1 departure entrance. She ran with us to the entrance and requested the police to let us in fast. Then we ran to check-in area, she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes. We could get the boarding passes just in time!

I have no issues with that however I wasn’t informed at the counters about 7kgs handbag allowance being inclusive of duty free. The staff at the boarding gate (QAS) staff, were rude they do not even try to be polite of courteous and straight away give ultimatums saying throw away the duty free, go back to duty free and return it, however if you do no return in 20 minutes we will offload you from the flight.

On May 30th, 2018 my husband, mother and myself were supposed to catch our flight from Delhi to Goa with Indigo. However, the day before our flight we received a message stating that our terminal had changed due to renovations in the airport. My husband had called the airlines to confirm and was told that our terminal had in fact changed. Once we arrived at the Delhi airport, security wouldn’t let us inside the airport and he kept telling us we were in the wrong terminal. We told him that the airlines themselves had confirmed about the terminal change, but he still didn’t want to let us in and asked us to go to the Indigo customer care outside of the airport. When we went inside the customer service area it was already packed with other passengers and we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by the only one Indigo agent that was there. After we explained the situation to the gentleman, he called his manager to help us. The manager took at least 15-20 minutes before he came down (after the agent called numerous times). When we re-explained the situation the manager told us he can’t help us and left mid-conversation, baffling both my husband and I with such horrible customer service, especially from someone in management, The manager left another agent to “deal” with us that was even less helpful. By this time, boarding to the plane had started and we were still stuck with the agent telling us she couldn’t do anything. We asked instead of giving us full credit to book us another flight and we would pay the difference but she did not want to do that. She said we will have to pay in full for the flights and we would not be reimbursed. By this time, all early flights were gone, and by the time we finally checked ourselves to book another flight with another airlines all flights to Goa for May 30th were booked. We booked our flight with Fly Air for 6 times the original price and had to book a hotel for another night at Delhi. We called the hotel in Goa to advise them we wouldn’t make it to the hotel that day, but rather the following afternoon and asked if we would be able to get a credit for that day, but unfortunately we couldn’t.

We had booked the XL seats in the 1st row for Rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey, but realized what a mistake that was. First of all, Indigo added a stopover in Doha, which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking, became nearly 10 hours. The seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights, with just a few more rows added in the back since the A321 is longer than the A320. This means that they use the same seats (with just about 4 cm of foam padding). The in-flight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased, and the best food you can buy on-board is cup noodles made with hot water. Even Air Asia, which is a much more LCC provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights. Additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at Doha during which they park in a remote bay, and open the doors for crew and cleaning. This means that if you are seated near the front of the plane, you will be exposed to hot desert winds of Qatar for about an hour. On top of this, even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row, emergency exits are paid seats, they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight. Why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then, only to get scammed during the flight like this? On top of this, the crew treat the first row like the ""toilet waiting area"", since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on. But the crew instead of sending them back to their seat, make them sit in the first row, which is a paid row.

I was walking through the airport randomly looking for your staff to sort this issue out and found one of your agents. She looked through it and tried from her end and told me it won’t be possible at this time as other seats are already occupied and you can do it on board and there is a lady seated at 19D. I told her my daughter is already tired from the Male flight and it’s important for us to sit together. She understood our situation and told she will try her best. At time of boarding I explained the same situation to boarding agent. She replied the same saying you should try it on board as nothing she could do it now. There comes the pleasant surprise! This staff member came all the way to our gate which she doesn’t have to bother doing at all. She literally looked for the passenger seated at 19D and talked to her and agreed to swap seats with mine. I was very much overwhelmed with her genuine concern towards our issue and how she went well and above to sort this out for us. Please pass my sincere gratitude to her. She deserves it.

I tried to online chat with an agent, however, they had no solution for me and kept telling me to try again. After a while of back and forth, the agent offered to hold the tickets for me and I can log in after and pay for them. After all this, trying another few times the payment  went through and I checked in but they have unchecked me. Apparently I need to present the card used for payment at the airport.

At least during the online check-in the airline didn't charge us for paying extra for the seat selection which was a slight relief. Both the flight segments themselves were quite okay and departed well on time even though some of the conduct of the passengers was questionable like not wearing the face shield / hazmat suit for the middle row seats even despite the crew reminding the passengers to wear it numerous times.

2021-11-29,"""could not have asked for anything better""",9,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had to go Indore for a family function and on this particular flight, we had checked in online and as the fare booked was a corporate fare the seat selection was free. At Bangalore airport, there is a separate section where the passengers can just drop off their bags and the staff there ensure that the bags are checked in which seems to be a much faster process and this is something that other airlines can emulate in order to reduce the waiting time in queues. Also another point to note is that even though the kiosk machines were not working and were unable to print the boarding passes, one can use the mobile boarding pass on the mobile phones for security access. This is also something I experienced first hand and was very valuable. The boarding started on schedule and the flight itself was very comfortable and as the booking was a corporate booking, one is entitled to a single meal and a beverage. I selected the paneer masala rice as it was in the afternoon time. The food was pretty decent along with the tea. Staff service was prompt and polite. Arrival was 30 mins ahead of schedule which was appreciated and the crew was wearing a smile on their faces even while de-boarding and thanking the passengers.

2021-11-29,"""it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage""",5,"✅ Trip Verified | On the return flight from Indore, the check-in of the luggage was done very swiftly as we reached the airport well ahead of departure. The boarding also started well on time. One thing that was observed was the huge amount of cabin baggage and the size of that baggage was also very big and yet there were no checks related to the hand baggage performed by the airline staff because it seemed that a lot of luggage were exceeding the 7kg limit and also the dimensions. Perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage? The crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during take-off it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly. Being efficient and on time is important, but never at the cost of safety. The flight itself was uneventful with a upma / tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time. I appreciate flying with the airline, but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures. Perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind. And also it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future. The rating is given based on the safety violation of not stowing away the cabin bags under the seat during takeoff but apart from that the flight and crew were really good.",Economy Class,4,yes,349,4,4,4,,Couple Leisure,A320,Indore to Bengaluru,November 2021,5,,IndiGo,India

Their website had a problem then why should I suffer for it, hence I requested a full refund for which they are not willing to give. I called them and after talking to their customer service for 01 hour or more, she would not give a full refund, neither solve the issue nor let me speak to her manager and wanted me to book for another date. From her I understood that the 04 Jan 22 flight was cancelled and they rescheduled the 05 Jan 22 flight, which I did not want due to the change in timing and fly with another airline as I have to reach on 05 Jan 22 early morning. These guys go by On Time departure and Arrival but none of that is true. So all of you be beware and customer service has a few lines which they repeat for every question and it really annoys you as this is not the right reply in English for a question asked.

However, in the last week the airline has had 2 major mishaps which have completely unravelled my travels and I felt compelled to warn other travellers. Firstly, they didn't inform travellers that Nepal requires an exit PCR test in order to leave the country. Of course, you could argue that it's up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country. I've travelled throughout covid and Nepal was the first country I went to requiring an exit test. Any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know, but not IndiGo. As a result, there was chaos at the airport and I missed my flight, along with 10 others. I flew the next day Kathmandu to Chennai (after paying 10000 rupees fare difference) with a short layover in Delhi. I was assured by IndiGo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to Chennai, and they put Chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket, so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in Delhi. Upon arrival in Chennai at 1am after a delayed departure, I was told my bag hadn't arrived because I was supposed to have cleared customs at Delhi Airport. It's now been 3 days, my bag is still in Delhi and IndiGo have no idea what's going on. They don't even know the right number to call at Delhi Airport to get an update. At the end of the day, fly IndiGo if you want a cheap flight and can count on things going according to plan, but don't expect any support if there are any disruptions as they don't appear to have the customer's best interests at heart.",Economy Class,4,no,353,4,3,3,,Solo Leisure,,Kathmandu to Delhi via Chennai,February 2022,4,,IndiGo,India

We made Indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at VTZ. Without trying to understand the extent of the damage, Indigo's agent blindly offered 500 rupees. We did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount. She also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel. It is appalling that Indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business. We left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do. Agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) with her and use the PIR to later submit a claim to Indigo later.

2022-11-02,"""management should be truly be ashamed""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  So, I tried to heed the many warnings that I saw in this airline's terrible reviews regarding their baggage “Scam” policy. I recently had a flight from Mumbai to Maldives, for which the ticket fare was $159 for a one-way ticket. Still a little pricey, but not bad. The only reason why I took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the Maldives. After booking the ticket, I noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance. My initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but I'm sure I can purchase a bag, just in case. The week of the flight, I spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. One problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. At 48 hours, I started the attempt to add a bag. The website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. When you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. Neither of these buttons work. I tried on Safari, Chrome, and also my mobile. Nada. The day before the flight, I spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. On my mobile, I was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. You click on that button and the screen goes blank. Long story short, I had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. I finally found the loophole. When you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. It will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. Add a bag. More confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). I thought, perfect! One catch, I didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on ALL the other airline websites out there. The morning of the flight, I saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so I added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. Yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. I get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. Guy said that my bags were too heavy. I was so confused. I tried what I could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. Come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos TOTAL. Doesn't say total on the website. So, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! What the ever living. That makes no sense. You pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. What a disaster. I ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. How the government allows this, I have no clue. I saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. Good description, but more like extortion. I also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. You have been warned, DO NOT use this airline. Hopefully one day, a reputable airline like Vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. And if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. There is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is GREED.

Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first. For ""Indigo"" Airlines, this is not the case will ""dump"" people onto the Bus and transport them from Gate to the Aircraft. In-Flight: Seating is congested, just like Auto-Rickshaw. The cabin crew is courteous and helpful. Landing: 30 Minutes late from their scheduled arrival. As a result, we had to spend another 30 Minutes at the HYD Airport for Immigration Officers' shift rotation. Overall DOH-HYD Experience is just a dump yard ride for me in Indigo Airlines. The journey from HYD to DOH, concerns starts with Check-In until the Landing. Nonetheless, this part of the journey is the most ""Interesting"" part of this review, don't miss it. Check-In: I cannot reiterate my Boarding comment mentioned above, but this Indigo airline is adverse in implementing standards of the International Flight code. Reached the Airport 4 hours before departure, Kids in arms and eight bags to check-in (opted porter service), had to stay in line for 1 hour 25 minutes to approach the check-in counter after repeated requests to follow the check-in code. Finally, at the check-in counter, the indigo staff was inclined to charge me 15k INR extra as my three bags had 1 kg extra and other bags had less than 23 kg allowed. Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight.

If you pay by credit card you have to comply with compulsory 'dynamic currency conversion', which means that the airline will charge you in your home currency (instead of in rupees). On arriving at Kolkata, we were informed that our luggage had been detailed at the origin because security checks had found a power battery pack (these cannot checked in) in the suitcase. We were assured that the suitcase would be returned to us within 24 hours after security had removed the offending item and store it for us to collect on our return to Chandigarh.

2023-03-07,"""impressed by the service""",9,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was totally impressed by the service I got on an Indigo Flight while traveling from Doha to Cochin. The food served, and the quality of service from the ground staff as well as the cabin crew was amazing. Moreover the efforts to make IndiGo the coolest airline has worked.

2023-04-10,"""worst and horrible experience""",1,Not Verified | The worst flight ever experienced in my life. My next IndiGo flight from Mumbai to Trivandrum is at 8.45 pm. The departure time of this flight was at 2.55 pm I’m still sitting in the flight (Now the time is 5.18pm). We had spent a huge amount to book these two flights. And now I’m going to miss my flight to Trivandrum. And the cabin crew is telling the flight will reach there at 7.15pm. As far as I know Srinagar to Mumbai will take minimum 3 hours flying time. The worst and horrible experience. Please don’t ever choose go first flight even though they give it free of first.

I was running late to catchup my evening return flight to Hyderabad, based my request, Indigo and Tirupati Airport Security helped me, reopened gate and security to get into flight which starts at 9pm which is impossible but they did it.

2023-04-19,"""three days to confirm a booking""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have spent over six hours across three days to confirm a booking via Indigo airline's payment processor (CC Avenue). I original tried to book with a US bank card. This process failed with vague messages, then I received an email stating I should wait 20 minutes for my booking to be confirmed. If not confirmed in 20 minutes I should make another payment on the booking PNR or if payment is confirmed and no booking confirmed, I need to wait one week for my money to be returned. Both my US banks flagged Indigo transactions as fraud. To make things worse, none of the five booking or payment processor representatives demonstrated they understand what PNR or airline's standard rules are. The phone systems were so bad that I was disconnected over 4 times and every representative had connection and audio issues. Now day three and 6 hours into a booking process where my Chase account has pre approved my payment, the last rep I worked with asked me to wait one hour for a call back because Indigo's payment systems were offline.

2023-04-22,"""will never fly with them""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst customer service I've ever experienced. I bought 2 tickets, one normal and one flexible through flight network and I had a work emergency. I cancelled my flight 3 weeks prior, according to their website they charge 400INR for cancellation when cancelled up to 4 days before the flight. I started the cancellation with flight network and it was immediately bad as they told me my flexible ticket didn't work on cancellation although I found a different information on the website (in some places it says it doesn't work, in others says it works), I emailed IndiGo and they told me my ticket was not flexible (I paid for flexi), anyway, after dozens of emails complaining, I decided to cancel anyway and pay the fee. No refund was processed. I asked to talk to someone in the complaints department, no refund the was processed so I emailed them again. I added attachments of all my conversations with the company and flight network, and they replied saying they would refund me. No refund was done so I emailed them again and received a ridiculous email they would refund me with no-show ammount (10% of my payment) which is unacceptable. I will never fly with them or book a ticket again.",Economy Class,1,no,431,,,,,Solo Leisure,,Dubai to Phuket,April 2023,2,,IndiGo,India

My flight landed at Chennai on T3 and I made some alcohol purchases from the duty free which was expensive. My flight from Chennai to Mumbai was at T1, after doing the security check I was informed that I cannot take the alcohol bottles in my cabin luggage. The security personnel helped get the bag checked in but even after mentioning that there are fragile items in the bag, there was no care taken.

2023-04-24,"""probably India’s best low cost airline""",5,Not Verified |  IndiGo are a low cost airline and as such are prone to delays. This flight left 40 mins late. Being only an ATR we couldn’t climb above the clouds making it a fairly uncomfortable flight. It’s a pay service although they do give you a free small bottle of water which strangely was handed out as we got off. Seats don’t recline. IndiGo style themselves as a funky airline and so their crew were badges with phrases such as leading lady or Miss IndiGo. I would use them again as I think they are probably India’s best low cost airline.,Economy Class,3,yes,433,2,2,,,Solo Leisure,ATR72,Jaipur to Ahmedabad,April 2023,2,,IndiGo,India

It was delayed by more than 1.5 hours last night and as scheduled, it was due to depart from Abu Dhabi Terminal 1. After arriving at the airport, we then found out that check-in was moved to T3 and boarding was back at T1. My father faced a lot of inconvenience in lost time and stress due to which he couldn't use the lounge prior to departure.

I had booked wheelchair assistance and it was mentioned that the wheelchair assistance was in waiting list. When they reached the airport it was mentioned no wheel chair assistance would be provided. They reached the airport close to 3 hrs in advance. The front desk did not even help with other paid assistance wheelchairs. They simply ignored my sister's requests. Departure was at gate 85, later it was changed to Gate 35 at last minute Again my mother had to walk such long distance without any assistance from the airline crew. At least the crew could have guided the family to a paid wheel chair assistance at Mumbai airport.",Economy Class,1,no,435,1,,,,Family Leisure,,Mumbai to Mangalore,May 2023,1,,IndiGo,India
