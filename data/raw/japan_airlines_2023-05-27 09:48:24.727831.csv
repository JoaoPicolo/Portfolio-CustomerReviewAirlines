2009-12-07,Japan Airlines customer review,6,"BNE-NRT connecting to Sapporo. Aircraft from Brisbane cramped with seats close together. Had to sit with legs apart as knees hit seat in front and am only 170cm (5'7""). FA friendly helpful and English speaking. Food disappointing. Hot meal was OK but snack consisted of stale multigrain bread with ham and plastic cheese with mustard pickle reminiscent of your school sandwiches. Obviously need better catering in Brisbane. Domestic connection in Narita was good. Seats better - less cramped. Efficient FA. Fares however cheaper than rival airlines so value for money.",Economy Class,1,yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2009-12-09,Japan Airlines customer review,6,Late night flight to Narita fully loaded 777. Despite the cramped seat pitch across their fleet I have enjoyed flying JAL. The service has been very warm efficient and polite. However the catering on this particular flight left a lot to be desired. After take off and waiting for a little over an hour - smiling flight attendants doled out a drink of choice and two small cookies. That was it - till breakfast was served a few hours later - no choice just the standard very bland congee. Also having flown on JAL the previous month having watched most of the movies available - I was a bit disappointed to find the selection of movies almost identical on this flight. So tried to catch up on sleep instead but with a short flight time breakfast was served about 4.30am. so not much sleep either. While not the best flight I've had with them I still would fly with them again - perhaps not a red eye like this one. Hope they get that cash injection from somewhere soon.,Economy Class,1,yes,2,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2009-12-14,Japan Airlines customer review,4,SIN-NRT. 11pm flight and the aircraft was extremely warm to the extent that we were sweating. 1 hour into the flight we were still waiting for our refreshments. We were only served a piece of cookie and a drink. This left us thirsty throughout the flight.,Economy Class,1,no,3,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2009-12-26,Japan Airlines customer review,9,Singapore to KL on B767-300 in Y class. Managed to get a good deal from Zuji website for S$103 including taxes (return). Travelled with family and 2 kids. Were given bulkhead seats on both sectors. Singapore-Kl was about 40% full. Flight was from KIX with a stopover in Singapore. Thus managed to get some seats from the back with my infant daughter. Was given packet of apple juice and disposable wet wipes. FA polite and offered more wet wipes when they saw me having a sandwich. Flight map shown during the flight. KL to Singapore was about 60% full a newer B767-300. Cushions were thinner compared to ANA Y Class. Don't think it would be comfortable for a flight for more than 6 hrs to KIX due to thin cushions. Overall flight was comfortable for a short flight and a bargain.,Economy Class,1,yes,4,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-01-12,Japan Airlines customer review,6,Rome to Tokyo. For a 12 hour flight it was very reasonable. Its fortunate I got an exit row seat otherwise I think I would have died. Im 6ft 5 and pretty thin so the width of the seat didn't bother me but if you are even slightly overweight I think you would find the seats uncomfortable. Service of staff on JAL is exceptional they are so wonderful happy and willing to help. This was a night flight but I didn't sleep. Also the inflight entertainment is woefully inadequate by today standards. Movies & TV shows are not on demand you have to wait until the movie/tv show restarts - very frustrating on a long haul flight. Probably wont fly again if it can be avoided.,Economy Class,1,no,5,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-02-17,Japan Airlines customer review,9,London Heathrow - Tokyo - Sydney. My first time in JAL as I had booked a FF Award seat on QF (LHR-SYD) and it turned out it was on JAL. Easy check-in great lounge. Service on board was better than I expected - B777-300ER on leg 1 B777-200 on leg 2. Very nice Japanese food possibly the best I have eaten in Economy. Great FAs happy to do their best to help with our young child. Ample legroom and happy to serve food out of normal service times if required. Very good first experience overall.,Economy Class,1,yes,6,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-03-06,Japan Airlines customer review,8,LHR-NRT-LHR booked economy only to get upgraded to business as economy was full with a lot of group bookings. Was lucky enough to get a bulkhead seat in business which had great legroom. Lie flat seats were excellent. Food was the best I have had on an airline and drink available at all times. Flight crew very attentive.,Business Class,1,yes,7,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-03-12,Japan Airlines customer review,10,NRT-SFO on B777-300ER with the new first class suites. The food was phenomenal and service was second to none. The cabin crew made me feel welcome and they took care of every little need. They were so polite and willing. I have flown every class on JAL and I would recommend it.,First Class,1,yes,8,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-03-28,Japan Airlines customer review,9,BNE-NRT Discount Business Class Fare to connect to Finnair flights to Europe. Meticulous service with good food and wine. B767-300 showing its age a little and as the business cabin was full I had a sense of claustrophobia. I recall JAL used to operate larger B747-400s on this run until a year or so ago so it would be nice to see this type of larger type of aircraft or similar used on this route again. Nevertheless an excellent flight with superb service.,Business Class,1,yes,9,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-03-29,Japan Airlines customer review,5,"BNE-NRT-BNE both sectors on aged B767-300 operated by Jalways crew. The cabin seats 6 abreast which felt too cramped for a business experience - seats are showing their age with limited functionality and no better than a domestic business class or international premium economy seat. Adequate for daytime flight only. The Magic-III inflight entertainment system worked - however I was disappointed by the range and selection of movies available. The in-flight service differed dramatically. On our flight to Narita we had a wonderful crew led by a Thai-based purser - hard working always in the cabin and a wonderful inflight experience which made up for the substandard cabin. On our return it was the opposite. The service was chaotic and disorganised. The business cabin was full and it was over 2 hours after boarding before we were even offered a drink. This is an overnight flight departing Narita ~2130 so the entire meal service should have been completed by 2 hours into the flight to ensure we had sufficient time to rest. However we hadn't even been offered a drink. We were exhausted after travelling in from Los Angeles so my partner walked down to the galley and requested a snack and a bottle of water. This was promptly provided for us but you could tell our request was not appreciated. The cabin temperature was hot during both flights and the air quality seemed stuffy and overly dry. Requests to lower the air temperature was denied as I was quoted ""that the Japanese passengers feel the cold"". Overall if flying JAL again on this route I would save the money and fly economy.",Business Class,1,no,10,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-08-18,Japan Airlines customer review,6,Nagoya - Bangkok return. JAL offered very good prices for the 6 hour trip so that was the main reason it was chosen over Thai Airways. The flight to Bangkok was an early evening flight which was quite reasonable. The plane was clean and recently refurbished updated IFE and new covers for economy seats. We ordered the vegetarian meal which was reasonable. The seats were newer and wider which was a vast improvement on the older planes JAL still uses. Service was fine when you asked for it but FAs were not very attentive. IFE was fine and had some good movies. The plane on the return journey was much older seats older and narrower design. Not very comfortable but had plenty of leg space as my wife and I got exit seats. This flight was overnight and we got little sleep and didn't eat anything as we were too tired. My wife was feeling queasy for the whole flight but the FA who was sitting opposite us went beyond the call of duty and constantly asked if there was anything she could do to make my wife more comfortable - she gave us extra blankets and chatted to us during the flight.,Economy Class,1,yes,11,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-08-21,Japan Airlines customer review,7,Narita-Amsterdam return B777-200ER. Boarding very smooth at both airports. Inflight service reasonable though flight attendants used very basic even rude English with customers whom they believed could not use Japanese which was a sharp contrast to the elegant Japanese used with Japanese passengers. The economy class seats are terrible unless you are a dwarf. They do not properly recline. The seat slides forward as the back reclines so the legs hit the seat in front: quite unsuitable for a 12-hour flight. Magic III was fair with a rather limited selection available.,Economy Class,1,yes,12,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-09-10,Japan Airlines customer review,3,JAL roundtrip from Chicago to Tokyo last week. I could not believe the 777-300ER had no individual ventilation system per seat. Whatever the reason the result is that the economy section was extraordinarily hot and stuffy where my daughter and I were sitting - to the point where she got sick and had a mild asthma attack. For 12 hours I was sweating with no relief. The return plane was a bit better but very uneven. It would cool down only to get hot again for 45 minute stretches. Several passengers including myself complained about the poor ventilation and A/C. I walked all over the economy section and noticed that as I walked down an aisle I could literally feel the temperature change - the uneven cooling was that noticeable. JAL flight attendants heading to Narita were very sweet to my daughter who had to sit in the jump seat in the galley as it was significantly cooler. On the way back to Chicago the flight attendant I complained to who was serving our side of the economy section was rather argumentative saying some passengers complained they were cold and had extra blankets. Well hardly anyone in economy had them as it was easy to check. I called her out and asked her to prove this and then she shut up. I happened to casually chat with 3 other passengers on this leg who also complained about the atrocious ventilation/temperature. What is going on here? JAL's food is pretty bad and the section is cramped but I got what I paid for so no complaints. They were very efficient in their service all around even if the food was awful and the red wine I got had actually turned into vinegar. I shall never fly them again.,Economy Class,1,no,13,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-09-19,Japan Airlines customer review,8,Sydney-Narita B777. Staff fantastic both on the ground and in the air. Japanese and Western choice for meal noodles during the flight and snack before landing. I'm 6' and was able to stretch out in the seat however the seat was a little hard. We got an excellent companion deal which made it excellent value even compared to several premium economy fares.,Business Class,1,yes,14,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-10-10,Japan Airlines customer review,8,Japan Airlines Sydney-Tokyo return. The flight is operated by Japan Airlines on behalf of Jalways. The service is polite and graceful. We travelled Premium Economy Class and there was always staff on hand to assist or offer you a drink soup or snack. Premium Economy seats are quite comfortable and have large tables. The meal service (the same as normal economy class) in both directions was good. I think they need a few more new release movies on their AVOD system and another inch or two of legroom so that it easier to slide out into the aisle when sitting at a window or middle seat.,Premium Economy,1,yes,15,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-10-26,Japan Airlines customer review,5,"Chicago to Narita which was a very nice flight all things considered. The food was good service was good and although there was not tons of leg room I was comfortable enough (I am only 5' 2""). The way back to Chicago from Narita was a nightmare. I had a seat next to my husband and all was fine at first till the Asian woman in front of me reclined her seat over halfway. On the flight there I had mine reclined about 1"" and when asked by a Stewardess to move it for the man behind me I did even though it was not mealtime. This woman would not move at all and the Stewardess would do nothing and even as a short person I was uncomfortably cramped. I asked the woman and the Stewardess for help but was ignored by the woman and told by the Stewardess she could do nothing. Then mealtime came they made her move and after the meal I put my pillow against the window and went to sleep. When I woke up (because I was in pain) her seat was all the way reclined and my legs were all cramped up. I asked her and the stewardess again with no result. I finally went and stood in the back of the plane and refused to sit in that seat unless the woman moved. I talked to the Stewardess explained that when asked to move I did explained I was in pain and said I paid just as much for my ticket as the other inconsiderate woman did. After standing there about 20 minutes they finally gave me a seat on the other side of the plane (which was a lot more roomy and the people over there were considerate). Nothing would have been done had I not forced the issue and I did not appreciate being treated that way. I will not fly JAL again not even in a higher class that was hands down the worst experience I ever had on a plane. I guess it is a value price if you don't mind being exceedingly uncomfortable for 14 long hours but I do mind. They only get a 5 because my flight one way was good but it is still a 50/50 gamble.",Economy Class,1,no,16,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-10-27,Japan Airlines customer review,7,Jakarta - Tokyo economy class. Check in excellent at CGK. Onboard comfortable with friendly and excellent FAs. For the 7 hour flight I think this flight needs more food and drink. IFE was old fashioned and small selection of movies and music.,Economy Class,1,yes,17,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-10-27,Japan Airlines customer review,6,NRT-CDG in Y class on B777-300ER. Crew offered good service with a good response. Seats were cramped. My feet touched the next seats which is not comfortable for 12+ hour trip. Food quantity and quality is seriously decreasing comparing to a few years ago. Entertainment OK with AVOD system.,Economy Class,1,no,18,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-11-03,Japan Airlines customer review,7,BKK-NRT on B767. Check in good but the lounge was not. Very small and cramped with the smoking room door opened. The flight was fine. Service pleasant and the food good although small in portion. Drink service and midflight snack was also on the small side. Seats fairly comfortable for the 5+ hour flight.,Business Class,1,yes,19,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2010-11-07,Japan Airlines customer review,9,Brisbane to London via Narita. Economy class and service was excellent and polite. Great food and drink service and IFE superb. Departing Narita we asked the English flight attendant for Scotch and Dry which she duly delivered but warned us that if we wanted another drink of the same to order it from her as apparently Dry Ginger Ale is not available to Economy passengers and none of the Japanese crew would serve it to us! Strange - does Dry Ginger cost more than lemonade? Osaka to Brisbane we made sure we bought a bottle of Canada Dry to have with our inflight Scotch!,Economy Class,1,yes,20,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-01-07,Japan Airlines customer review,6,HKG-HND/NRT-HKG during the holiday period. Flights on time and crew friendly. Crew were not strict with safety regulations - passengers roaming round with seat belt sign on or using footrest during take-off and landing were ignored by crew who saw what was happening. Food was horrible. I'm no fussy eater but it was not appealing. I have never seen such small meals served for a 4 hr flight.,Economy Class,1,yes,21,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-01-26,Japan Airlines customer review,9,LHR - NRT return B777-300 Executive class. Flight to Tokyo was on the warm side as JAL flights often are. Choice of films OK but I expected more top billing films - the programme was padded out by many old or b movie films. Food good but as always a bit limited in choice Beef or Fish never anything else! JAL shell seats do not recline flat which is comfortable at first but you find yourself slowly sliding downwards - good for 2 or 3 hours sleep. Return flight much the same a pleasant experience with excellent service from flight attendants.,Business Class,1,yes,22,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-02-07,Japan Airlines customer review,10,NRT-SGN. Good movie options very friendly and professional staff. My first time with them totally recommend.,Economy Class,1,yes,23,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-02-18,Japan Airlines customer review,6,Paris-Tokyo in business. Check in was fast handled by Air France. Check in staff nice but refused to issue my onward boarding pass with Cathay Pacific (their oneworld partner) to Taipei but a staff in JAL uniform apologized. Seat is not a flat bed not comfortable at all as you slide down and entertainment system is old and choice very limited. Crew very polite and food is good both quality and quantity. Very strange though that they put some British cabin crew that do not speak French on Paris flights. As I cannot sleep I was working and the crew kept on refilling with tea and snack. All in all an excellent service but the uncomfortable seat and poor entertainment drags it down a lot.,Business Class,1,yes,24,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-03-05,Japan Airlines customer review,6,NRT-PVG-NRT. B767 outbound and B737 inbound. Old 767 aircraft but exit row so a lot of legroom. PTV on 767 is small. Meal good and crew were helpful and attentive. I was on a new 738 on my inbound flight - cabin was not spacious but seat was comfortable. Huge personal screen with high resolution service good.,Economy Class,1,yes,25,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-03-06,Japan Airlines customer review,9,SIN-NRT HND-SIN. SIN-NRT on a relatively new 767-300 in immaculate condition and service was great. The biggest welcome was big touch screen monitors on every seat - movies and selections were up to date. Cabin crew constantly walking up and down the aisle. Return trip was via Haneda. Same aircraft similar service provided for the overnight flight. I would consider flying on JAL again after this great and positive experience.,Economy Class,1,yes,26,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-03-08,Japan Airlines customer review,6,LAX-PVG. LAX to NRT was not as expected from Japan Airlines seat on business class was not a flat bed and being 6'2 is not a good one to sit. They don't have amenity in a bag like other business class but in a basket and FA goes around and let you pick which one you want and all wrap in a cheaply plastic . Food were served in a bento box looks nice in pictures but not in real food really disappointed. Love the lounge at LAX and NRT ate at the lounge in NRT. NRT to PVG as usual same old business class.,Business Class,1,no,27,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-03-14,Japan Airlines customer review,3,NRT-KUL on old 767 in J class. Seat narrow and nothing special. Crew very senior doing things very slowly. Meal service took over 4.5hrs and really showed favouritism if you are not Japanese. Not worth the money for what JAL is charging for Premium service compared to SQ and CX.,Business Class,1,no,28,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-03-14,Japan Airlines customer review,4,NRT-KUL business class on old 767. Not worth the money as the seat was old and the entertainment system quite limited with old screen. The lounge in NRT was packed in the satellite and people were grabbing the food out of the servery as soon as it arrived. The service onboard was chaotic to say the least. Had to ask for something to eat with the drink. The meal service was over 4 hours. Seat not comfortable for over 8 hour flight. Seems that if you speak the language and are male you get better service as all the male business men got bags tagged first class - and this class was not available on the flight.,Business Class,1,no,29,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-04-04,Japan Airlines customer review,9,Frankfurt-Narita on B777. Spotless cabin. Comfy seats and superb service from very friendly flight attendants. Very good meals lots of drinks between dinner and lunch prior landing.,Economy Class,1,yes,30,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-04-10,Japan Airlines customer review,9,Paris - Tokyo Narita Boeing 777. Seats 2-3-2 and originally in the middle. Cabin crew very helpful and found me an aisle seat. Inflight service superb very personal and attentive cabin crew. Meal choice either Western or Japanese. I chose the former superb french cuisine but nearby passenger had the oriental and I wish I had chosen that. In flight entertainment AVOD and could be better - plenty of movie choice but little in the way of TV comedy sport and documentaries.,Business Class,1,yes,31,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-04-24,Japan Airlines customer review,9,Sydney-Narita-Frankfurt in Business. Fantastic crew and ground staff professional and friendly. JAL business class seats are full flat 2-3-2 arrangement made the cabin really crowded. Sydney-Narita leg using economy headset for business class. Food was beautifully presented but not always tasty. IFE good not great after two legs you pretty much finished everything you could watch. Two first class lounges at Narita terminal 2 hardly anyone there middle of the morning. Buffet dinning spa massage fantastic but only 10 minutes.,Business Class,1,yes,32,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-05-10,Japan Airlines customer review,8,Tokyo Hanada-Beijing-Tokyo Narita in Business class. JAL has a nice first class lounge at Hanada airport great food and drinks nice facilities but does not have spa service. Business class seat is more like Qantas domestic business class seat. Hot meal served with good choice of drinks. Cabin crew friendly and professional. AVOD system is okay does not have great range of movies. JAL uses Beijing airport first lounge at PEK pretty average for first class lounge.,Business Class,1,yes,33,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-05-11,Japan Airlines customer review,10,SYD-NRT-FRA then CDG-HND-NGS then FUK-NRT-SYD in business class. As a JAL Mileagebank member able to select preferred seat in advance - 1st row in J class with more room. B777's to/from Australia/Japan/Europe MD90/B737-800 internally. Friendly courteous service comprehensive menu with choice of Japanese and Western options. European sectors now have an expanded on- demand 2nd meal service with about 10 options to choose from any time after first meal service. IFE improved since last year with more movies. Whilst our travel agent booked discounted JAL airpasses for Y class travel in Japan these were easily upgraded to J class at check-in for Y1000 each. Great value for the extra room. Did not use the CDG lounge due to a very tight Air France connection from FCO. Sakura lounge at NRT very comfortable with good selection of snacks and hot food especially at lunch and dinner time. Upstairs bar with barperson able to make a wide variety of drinks. Great value J fares to Europe makes JAL my preferred choice for European travel.,Business Class,1,yes,34,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-05-21,Japan Airlines customer review,8,SYD-NRT-FRA-NRT-SYD in Premium Economy (plus NRT-SIN-NRT J Class). Excellent aspects were the meticulous cabin crew service good leg room seats which allowed sleep and quiet cabins. Not so good was the food in Premium Economy - minuscule tasteless portions of poor quality especially to and from Australia. I can recall wonderful Japanese food even in basic economy 10 years ago on JAL. An odd aspect is that JAL seemed not to be able to recognise my OneWorld Emerald details and status until I complained on check-in on each leg. Another odd aspect was the default position of having all window shades closed on boarding and even on take off and landing. Isn't this policy a safety hazard? I enjoyed the First Class Lounges at Narita Sydney (through Qantas) and at Frankfurt.,Economy Class,1,yes,35,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-05-21,Japan Airlines customer review,10,I flew with my baby who was only 2 months old when we first took JAL. The staff at the airport was nice and helped with everything including luggage. At the boarding gate the staff was also there to carry my bags and fold the stroller and put it in a thick plastic bag to protect it! On arrival Narita and JFK the staff was there to help me with luggage and also helped me carry the bags through immigration and customs.,Economy Class,1,yes,36,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-05-30,Japan Airlines customer review,2,I recently flew to Narita from LAX. I will not take JAL again. The most unpleasant part of the experience was how warm it was inside the cabin. Both my daughter and I could hardly stand it. She took off her sweater and hat and I had to get a wet towel and use it on my face and neck. I had to chew some peppermint gum to calm my stomach. Also the food was pretty bad Much of what we were offered I wouldn't touch. For the trip back we were prepared and brought food with us.,Economy Class,1,no,37,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-06-25,Japan Airlines customer review,7,ORD-NRT Business class great looking B777 and nice interior. JAL Entertainment system stands among best airlines. Food was nice especially the curry. Sakura lounge in NRT was also very good was able to take shower and free massage chair. Business seat was bit narrow but was endurable. NRT-ICN Business class with bad service. Very interesting how different the service was from long distance routes. B767 was also outdated and old. Best of all was their punctuality. Everything was on time and felt very safe in flight.,Business Class,1,yes,38,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-06-30,Japan Airlines customer review,6,LAX-Narita-Hanoi and would not go on JAL again. One reviewer commented on how warm the flight was and I couldn't agree more so warm I was going crazy and switched into some shorts from my carry on. Poor service as they seem to be catering to those who were Japanese. Entertainment system was old and filled with older movies and few new releases. They got me back alive and in one piece but would not take them again.,Economy Class,1,no,39,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-07-06,Japan Airlines customer review,7,SYD-NRT. This was the 4th time I have taken this flight in the past 3 yrs. Each time the flight left and arrived on time. The quality of the flight attendants was exceptional on every flight. The grooming charm and elegance was equal to the best in the world. The personal service was most attentive and friendly. My wife left a scarf in the plane at Narita and one of the flight attendants found her in the immigration line and returned it to her. The downside is the service products. No menus or amenity packs. The entertainment system is poor the portions of food are small and the food is barely edible. The red wine is of fair quality but the white wine is almost undrinkable. As mentioned by other reviewers the cabin tends to be warm. If these female flight attendants had a quality product to offer the ranking would be equal to the top airlines.,Economy Class,1,yes,40,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-07-21,Japan Airlines customer review,2,Haneda to Seoul Gimpo Economy class. This flight from HND-GMP was my second flight on JAL since 2003. In 2003 JAL was great and I was surprised by JAL's service. However HND-GMP flight recently was just a disappointment. Warm and kind service is long gone. Instead there are lethargic FA's who can't speak either English or Korean. Meal was plain rice wasn't cooked well and coffee wasn't hot. The airport and the planes were both very humid and stuffy.,Economy Class,1,no,41,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-07-24,Japan Airlines customer review,10,"ORD-NRT on Boeing 700-300. The Economy cabin was full so they upgraded me to Premium Economy with no extra charge. The service was exceptional and the food was great. NRT-ORD in Economy. The seat wasn't as small as I expected but I'm only 5'2"" so I can imagine what it would be like for someone over 6'. The service was excellent and the food was good.",Economy Class,1,yes,42,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-08-02,Japan Airlines customer review,7,Jakarta-Narita-Jakarta on B777-200 aircraft Economy class. There was no delay for either outbound or inbound flight. Cabin was so-so clean tidy and nice inflight entertainment was okay. Meal tasted very nice cabin staff were very deft and courteous. The only downside from the flight was the air conditioner felt pretty warm on CGK- NRT sector some passengers including me told the FA and problem was fixed afterwards. The other was Tokyo- Ishigaki-Naha-Tokyo with B737-400 and B747-400. No delay overall flight was so-so just a little disappointed when there was no hot meal for Tokyo-Ishigaki and Naha-Tokyo service which is a quite long domestic flight.,Economy Class,1,yes,43,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-08-18,Japan Airlines customer review,10,SYD-NRT-LHR B772 AND B773 Premium Economy. Great flights reasonable inflight catering SYD-NRT and better NRT-LHR. Good selection of alcohol. Good IFE but more recent selections would be good. Seat comfortable and plenty of leg room for a 194cm passenger especially in row 17 (bulkhead). Only downside is the noise cancelling headsets promised on the JAL website don't materialise. For the price a really good option for long haul Australia to Europe or US especially if you want a stopover in Japan.,Premium Economy,1,yes,44,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-08-21,Japan Airlines customer review,8,SYD-NRT. Premium Economy. Crew hospitable. Avoid the window seat as it is still difficult to get out of. Movie selection okay although no noise cancelling headsets. Staff were respectful.,Economy Class,1,yes,45,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

2011-08-29,Japan Airlines customer review,,Sydney to Narita then to O'Hare return in Premium Economy. I have been flying JAL regularly since 1985 and these flights were probably the worst I have experienced. Terrible seats hard tiny tilt back and no legroom under seat in front very average food and low quality Spanish wines. With an enforced stopover in Narita they have even cut out supplying breakfast.

2011-09-01,Japan Airlines customer review,,My daughter and I flew LAX to Narita. Other reviewers have mentioned this - the air temperature in the cabin was stifling. It was so warm I felt sick. I was wearing a dress and sandals so it wasn't because I was overdressed. Nine hours of this was horrible. As was the food.,Economy Class,1,no,49,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-09-10,Japan Airlines customer review,10,Originally flying with American Airlines from Dallas-Tokyo but due to a delay in our flight from Montreal we were rebooked with Japan Airlines from Chicago-Tokyo. From the ground staff at O'Hare Airport to the service onboard everything was great and I was very well treated by everyone. I can tell the smile and friendliness were genuine. I will continue to fly with JAL.,Economy Class,1,yes,50,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-09-21,Japan Airlines customer review,4,Sydney-Tokyo Narita-Sapporo-Tokyo Haneda then Tokyo Narita-Sydney. The seating was cramped I am 170cm and my knees were up against the seat in front my husband was much more cramped than me. The entertainment system was average - all movies started at the same time. The domestic legs were thankfully short it was actually a novelty how old the aircraft's were for these legs but the cabin crew were lovely. We tried to upgrade on the return leg but were told our ticket class was not upgradable. They didn't do anything wrong as such but didn't really do anything right either and it is just too long a flight to be that uncomfortable.,Economy Class,1,no,51,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-10-09,Japan Airlines customer review,2,"LAX-NRT-SYD premium economy. The staff were lovely very helpful. The seats were terrible my husband is 6'2"" and I am 5'7"" and neither of us could get comfortable. They may suit if you are under 5' but for average height and weight we found it impossible to get comfortable foot rests were too short (cut into your calf) and when the seat reclines it creates a gap at your back that makes it very hard to relax. The cabins were also very warm no airflow and food was also terrible.",Premium Economy,1,no,52,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-10-09,Japan Airlines customer review,9,Only 3 out of 9 seats occupied. Food was great as was selection of champagne and wines. The Solo Sleeper seat is nice cushions are on the hard side. The seat turns into a flat bed which is a bit narrow though. The entertainment system is good but screen in First is quite small. I prefer the bigger screen in Business. So for a day flight take business (good food excellent entertainment) and for a night flight first (good sleep after an excellent meal).,First Class,1,yes,53,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-10-12,Japan Airlines customer review,9,JFK-NRT in Business Class on B777-300. Exceptional service and delicious food. Seat comfort was good - not great as I found the bed position to be a bit awkward and hard to get comfortable for sleep. IFE excellent. Only real negative was the 2x3x2 configuration which would be unacceptable if I had a middle seat. Ground staff and cabin crew were attentive professional and caring.,Business Class,1,yes,54,,,,,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-10-16,Japan Airlines customer review,5,NRT-SYD in Premium Economy. This cabin is a well-priced alternative to economy in theory contains shell-style seats good IFE etc. My biggest complaint is related to legroom. Although Premium Economy has more advertised legroom than Economy due to the presence of large metal boxes (presumably supporting the IFE) under the seat in front of me I couldn't fully extend my legs which made it hard to sleep hence negating the value proposition. I did notice these boxes throughout the cabin so suspect it wasn't just my seat. And I'm neutral to negative on the shell seat as well. Yes it is nice that nobody is reclining in your face but the slide is awkward and I don't find it terribly comfortable. Food in Premium Economy much more akin to Economy than Business. Cabin attendants were attentive warm and professional.,Premium Economy,1,yes,55,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

The staff was very courteous and helped us before during and after the flight. We also had priority boarding because of our baby so we did not have to stay in line. They have individual TVs and the beverages are free unlike US airlines.,Economy Class,1,yes,56,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2011-12-12,Japan Airlines customer review,10,Sydney-Tokyo-London return. Superb flights all on time or early. High quality and professional inflight service where flight attendants seemed to be able to anticipate one's need before-hand. With the possible exception of SYD-NRT high standard of food offered throughout. The bathrooms were kept spotlessly clean and looked brand new. Good quiet first class lounge at Narita although Japan Airlines uses the BA First Class Lounge at Terminal 3 at Heathrow and this was not so good. However for the price offered this was very good value for what was overall a five star experience.,Business Class,1,yes,57,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2012-01-09,Japan Airlines customer review,6,SYD-NRT-SFO return Dec 2011/Jan 2012. Premium Economy seat was not as good as I thought. The leg room was fine as I am not tall person but the seat recline was just as bad as economy. The lounge service was a bonus. The food was the same as economy and was ok. Movie selections pretty much the same as other airlines. FA's were professional polite and pleasant.,Premium Economy,1,yes,58,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2012-01-19,Japan Airlines customer review,10,SYD-TYO-SYD. Excellent service from cabin comfort and cleanliness to food (variety and quantity) to attentive and professional cabin crew.

2012-02-28,Japan Airlines customer review,8,ORD-NRT route Executive class. Cleanliness and high quality service can be expected. Would love to see JAL compete more with entertainment: entertainment network choices are not as high as a US based airline. Food: Though quality is quite good the Western menu is pretty much steak and 1 other seafood choice. The eat any time menu seems to be the same as well over the last few years. Cabin comfort: The HVAC of aircraft is usually very warm to the point that it becomes uncomfortable for some Westerners. Other Asian airlines are becoming super competitive and I think JAL can do better.,Business Class,1,yes,61,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2012-02-29,Japan Airlines customer review,6,Nagoya to Narita to connect with an international flight in J Class. Airport experience consistent efficient check-in and security and very disappointing lounges. No food on offer for this early morning departure. Boarding well organised and friendly crew. Sadly again nothing but a cold drink on offer on this 55 minute flight. Have travelled JAL a few times in Executive Class and it seems you never get anything but a cold drink in a paper cup. Connection worked well though. Sadly the lounge in Tokyo was so busy I did not get to eat there either.,Business Class,1,yes,62,1,1,1,N/A,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2012-03-12,Japan Airlines customer review,6,B777-300ER skysleeper solo (CDG-NRT) 3A. Seat is not full flat and is uncomfortable and old. It is possible to fully extend your legs although your heel is in the air because of short seat. Inflight entertainment is good and enough to enjoy in Japanese English and Chinese. The 10 inch monitor is very small and old-fashioned. I chose Japanese cuisine and seasonal appetizers were very cold (almost frozen). A la carte menu was very good.,First Class,1,yes,63,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2012-04-12,Japan Airlines customer review,9,I had two flights - one from Beijing to Tokyo and a connecting flight from Tokyo to San Francisco. Both were excellent. Flight attendants were polite helpful and made sure blankets and pillows were available. FA's responded quickly when I needed water for medication. Meal service was excellent with good food on both flights and real silverware. Seats were more comfortable than you usually find in economy.

2012-04-25,Japan Airlines customer review,2,Still at Tokyo NRT Admirals club waiting for connecting AA flight to Dallas. First leg New Delhi to Tokyo. In New Delhi after priority boarding was over everyone else was waiting when suddenly a Japanese official turned up and started moving a few people from the back of line and few late comers towards the priority entrance. He kept shouting – with no one understanding and shrugged others off. Awful inflight service it seems as if staff are forced to serve passengers they want to get it done as soon as possible and don't respond to calls. I saw calls from multiple passengers left unanswered. Most of the food was ok. Twice they provided empty cup for tea/coffee as part of meal tray but my cup went empty both times. On the other hand admiral club facility at NRT proved to be a great experience. Much better than those in Chicago. After today's experience I would not travel JAL unless I am forced to.,Economy Class,1,no,65,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2012-05-20,Japan Airlines customer review,3,Vancouver-Tokyo-Bangkok. The service was outstanding the food the same. The seats on these flights are outdated and have not been upgraded in years.

2012-05-27,Japan Airlines customer review,9,777 SYD-NRT and 787 HND-PEK. Food was good but not fabulous on both legs IFE was good but other carriers have a much broader selection. Where JAL truly stands out is customer service. From the moment the boarding pass is scanned at the gate to the exit onto the jetway one gets the impression that these employees care about superior service. How refreshing after the take-it-or-leave-it attitude on most US- based carriers! 787 was a nice experience with the oversized windows which darken at the touch of a button and the ride is slightly quieter than other aircraft's but cannot see that the individual passenger experience is greatly improved. My only criticism of JAL is that the cabin is kept a little warmer than I would like as others have commented - still it wasn't bad enough to deter me from flying them again.,Business Class,1,yes,67,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2012-06-17,Japan Airlines customer review,8,I went on a domestic flight from OKA-HND. The flight was very comfortable.

2012-06-18,Japan Airlines customer review,9,Initial leg HNL to TOK B767. As a Sapphire Member in one world alliance the check in process at HNL was very smooth orderly and efficient. The Sakura Lounge was average but allowed for a good working environment. Boarding was also no issue. Flight attendants were very pleasant spoke fluent English and were available through out the flight. Numerous refreshments offered including soup tea water and coffee. Meal service was very good. Hot ample and tasty. AVOD system offered many options and the screen size acceptable. Aircraft was an older 767 but in good shape and comfortable. Second Leg TOK to PVG. Able to use the Sakura lounge in TOK. Very comfortable good food service as well as call brand refreshments. Boarding was again efficient and smooth. Food service quick and ample good tasting portions. Flight attendants were very nice and always available. Did not use the AVOD as a nap was certainly needed. Overall a fine experience and would certainly recommend the carrier except that they do not credit your account with 100% miles unless one is paying full coach or better fare. That's a drawback.,Economy Class,1,yes,70,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

2012-07-15,Japan Airlines customer review,7,SIN-HND and NRT-SIN. Aircraft for both flights were new 767s with MAGIC V entertainment and new Recaro seats. Both flights departed and arrived on time. Flight to Haneda was a night flight so a little snack and drink was served before the lights were switched off for a good four hours. Breakfast was a Japanese-style omelette with rice and noodles (only one option) which I did not particularly enjoy. Staff were friendly and polite throughout. The flight from Narita to Singapore was a day flight two snacks as well as a lunch were served. Service was fantastic on this flight as well and there were two options for lunch which were both quite tasty. Inflight entertainment was average the large MAGIC V touch screen was great however there was a limited number of movies and the music selection was poor compared with that on my connecting flight to Australia with Qantas. Despite some minor drawbacks where this airline excelled was its customer service which was excellent from beginning to end. Overall my experience with JL was great and I would have no hesitation with flying them again to and from Japan.,Economy Class,1,yes,72,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

2012-10-08,Japan Airlines customer review,5,My wife and I travelled London to Sydney via Narita using JAL all the way travelling Premium economy. The most disappointing aspect of the JAL flights was the very poor food - options and quality. It was substandard relative to what is available elsewhere and for the price (either in terms of FFPoints or money) of a Premium economy flight . We were disappointed. Also the in flight entertainment system gave very limited options for films. Having moved about Japan internally on occasions the food and the film options were intended more for a Japanese customer base and not for a global community of travellers.,Premium Economy,1,no,78,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2012-10-12,Japan Airlines customer review,6,NRT to ICN. The service was good but the cabin was outdated. The food was not great- only Japanese meal available on my flight. The portion was not generous. The duty free selections were very limited on Tokyo-Seoul route. After meal a small bottle of Japanese liquor was offered with one bag of rice snack and one bag of nuts. The flight attendants were very knowledgeable to introduce all kinds of liquors they had and kept having them coming if you wish. I ended up trying three different Japanese liquors (shochu Sake and Umeshu). I enjoyed all of them. The service manger even wrote me a small note of how to make Japanese cocktail.

Check-in was fast and smooth at both SIN and NRT airports. However check-in counter staff at NRT had problems conversing in English. Flights were able to depart and arrive on time. Seats were rather cramped with barely sufficient leg space but still acceptable. Cabin attendants were attentive and respond to calls promptly. Unfortunately their English proficiency was not up to standard and most of them spoke mostly in Japanese to even non-Japanese passengers. Also despite being an international flight all the announcements were made in Japanese before English. Food was palatable which comes in a main course 2-3 side dishes and fruits. The drink menu was standard. IFE included variety of games television shows movies from various regions around the world but many of them were rather outdated.

2013-02-27,Japan Airlines customer review,3,Very disappointed with the flight. I flew from Bangkok to Narita. Check-in was a disaster. The counter agent changed my airline and departure time without telling me about the change. I believed that I had a 3 hour wait for my flight departure whereas with the change I needed to get to the gate within 30 minutes on a different airline and I missed the flight. This meant that I had to wait 16 hours for the next flight! I finally left on JAL Flight# 718. Flight staff were very friendly. The food was all Japanese which I can not eat.

Food excellent. I had travelled a few time with Japan Airlines and I noticed the food quality has increased. Staff very professional on all flights. Seat pitch is a little bit tight though. Hopefully the new economy cabin (to be available in the next few months) will provide more space. Upgraded to Premium Economy from Narita to Chicago and was quite impressed with the quality of the product (I have also travelled Business class with them a few years ago).

There was simply no predictability to it. Some were served relatively quickly but we and others throughout the cabin waited 2 hours for our first drink. Couple across the aisle were served a second drink given their menus and had orders taken before we had a drink or a menu. We asked for a menu and were not given one for an hour after the first request. Food when it came was good and beautifully presented as were the other meals available on request. Once poured drinks were replenished frequently. Angled flat seat was relatively comfortable for sleep.

Terminal was busy and we were whisked to the new B737-800 by bus. Terminal was congested and we were on the runway for an hr before take off. Seats were comfortable and we slept. Cabin crew served one round of drinks to the 80% full flight. Children were given JAL stickers. Drop down screens showed flight map. Headphones were provided for music entertainment. Return flight on same aircraft. Managed to get upgrade to J class. Check in staff was new and it took her 40 mins to check in our 4 bags + 2 strollers. To our surprise she checked in our bags all the way to Singapore even thought our flight to SIN was not under One World (Delta Airlines).

I used the supplied bag which instructed you to hand it to staff when used. I got up to dispose of it and flight attendants avoided me for 5 minutes! Eventually a female attendant came over to me and took the bag. I asked for some water. 30 minutes later still no water. My husband went and asked the hostess for the water and she told him she'd forgotten and she'd just bring it over. 10 minutes later she came over with a bottle of water by this time I was asleep anyway.,Economy Class,1,no,95,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

Food was average and more for local tastes although the noodles were redeeming. Overall a very average experience.,Economy Class,1,no,97,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-06-04,Japan Airlines customer review,2,FRA-NRT-FRA. Business class seat rather uncomfortable. Front of the business cabin was freezing while back was too hot. Staff just did not speak English which was rather frustrating at the time. I had ordered a Gluten Free meal due to my allergy and I was starving the whole time in both directions meals were not even a snack size and just salad leaves. My main complaint would be the food I guess JAL took the food allergy as allergic to food. It was horrible! My advice: pay a bit more and fly ANA.,Business Class,1,no,98,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-06-09,Japan Airlines customer review,8,NRT-SYD and BKK-HND. It was my first time on this airline and I thought their service and product were extraordinary. The meals were very tasty Japanese and even served with Miso-soup. On leg between BKK-HND portions were a little small (night flight) with no meal choice. The cabin and toilets are very clean which I think is always important. AVOD was working perfectly and there were enough English options to choose from. The Crew was outstanding! They are not only correct and polite all the time but smiling and cheering as well.,Economy Class,1,yes,99,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-06-10,Japan Airlines customer review,5,NRT-PVG was excellent food and service. TPE-HND a few days later was not so good - although a 3.5hr flight the order for drink and meal was taken after takeoff and arrived together 45 mins later. No refill offered. The economy-style Japanese rice/pork dish had been ruined by re-heating leaving rice more like a biscuit pork and veg solid. When I said it was inedible they appeared surprised. An apology and hope that my next JAL flight experience will be better from manager. I wonder whether there is a different service standard in/out of HND compared to NRT.,Business Class,1,yes,100,1,1,1,N/A,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-07-03,Japan Airlines customer review,9,I bought a one-way ticket on JAL at the last minute MNL-NRT-JFK for about USD 800 a great value. The flights were right on time on Boeing 767 and 777 the seating and food was very good. USB charger and stainless steel silverware were extra touches. The Asian food was very good as were the Japanese beer and French wine.,Economy Class,1,yes,101,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-07-07,Japan Airlines customer review,10,SYD-NRT NRT-LHR LHR-NRT NRT-SYD. Excellent service including food cabin crew and AVOD. Was my first experience on the new Business Skysleeper seat that reclines to 100% flat. Very comfortable and very private. Plenty of room to stretch out with lots of room in the seated position to store magazines laptop headphones etc. Ability to order meals post the first meal service using the touch screen controller on the seat. Very convenient. Excellent value as well especially when considering I was connecting to the LHR-NRT leg from Frankfurt and this flight was included as part of the original fare at no cost in J class. Will definitely fly again.,Business Class,1,yes,102,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-07-31,Japan Airlines customer review,6,"NRT to LHR on flight JL401 on 30th July economy. Check in smooth and fast. On board the seats were incredibly uncomfortable. I honestly think they had just covered the hard shell of the seat in fabric because there was so little padding but it felt like there was plenty of legroom. Customer service on board was (as expected from a Japanese airline) spectacular. I'm on a gluten free diet and the stewards who were all bilingual were extremely polite and helpful. What really impressed me on this flight was the food. Bearing in mind I was in economy I didn't expect to be served two gourmet meals (by airline standards) including a steak and red wine reduction! Although this was a special gluten free meal everyone seemed impressed with the food in general which all looked very good. Without a doubt the best food I've had on a flight including business class on BA. Other than the uncomfortable seats my major complaint is the IFE which was appalling. Only a handful of English language movies of which 4 were so-called ""new releases"" and only 5 of which I'd ever heard of. There wasn't a single English language TV show on board and the Japanese programming (which was plentiful) doesn't do much for a western audience. I'd consider another airline next time I fly to Japan - on a 12 hour flight the last thing I want is to run out of things to watch.",Economy Class,1,no,103,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

We were fortunate to have row 23 seats ABC & D on a 777-200 which is the first row past business class. Plenty of legroom which was a blessing. However the entertainment selection was rather poor especially the movie selection for our 12 + hour flight. I wish they offered a bit more choice as far as the food selection goes. I know most of the people were Japanese and they liked it but I'm not. Would I fly JAL again? If they offered the best price I certainly would.,Economy Class,1,yes,104,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

2013-08-21,Japan Airlines customer review,3,HEL-NRT on 19/8/2013. The aircraft for the route was a new B787 which is quiet and comfortable as such. The service was Japanese style - extremely polite yet distant. Food in business class was a strange mix of excellent and mediocre dishes. The seat was not a very comfortable seat for a nearly 190 cm height. It was not lie flat seat and was uncomfortable for a business class seat. All in all a fine service but not great.,Business Class,1,no,106,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-09-30,Japan Airlines customer review,10,From Tokyo Narita to Helsinki Vantaa with a Boeing 787-800 Dreamliner. Very comfortable cabin with good seats and ambient light. Large window and large video screen. Great choice of movies to see. The service was very good very friendly staff continuously through the entire flight. Lunch and dinner were very tasty next to the good quality there was also more than enough food served. Great choice for beverages and ice cream was also being served. Aircraft was clean including the quite large and modern toilets. This was a very good flight one of the best I ever had and the flight was relatively cheap. Definitely a recommendation!,Economy Class,1,yes,107,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-10-15,Japan Airlines customer review,7,HKG-NRT-HNL R/T with a mixture of 767 recliners and 777 angled lie-flat. Service efficient and reasonably friendly. I found the seats outdated and far less comfortable than those of several Asian competitors. Briefly lost power coming into Narita which was not fun. Communication with passengers in English seems to be a challenge for the flight deck crew and seemed to be intentionally avoided. Food was generally good but nothing spectacular. The IFE on all flights was poor with limited mediocre content. All things considered JAL is barely superior to any domestic U.S. carrier but decidedly lagging behind many others on a regional and global scale.,Business Class,1,no,108,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-10-29,Japan Airlines customer review,7,SYD-NRT-FRA-NRT-SYD. I generally like Japan Airlines especially the exceptionally high service standards and generally good food. However on recent Premium Economy travel through from Sydney to Frankfurt and return I found the shell seats almost impossible for sleeping (were these cast-offs from the similar old Cathay Pacific seats one wonders?) and due to a promotional fare offer the PE cabin was packed with noisy passengers and became claustrophobic which tends to negate the benefits of flying PE in the first place! Also this must be the only airline I can think of that allows passengers to keep their window shades closed during the take-off and landing phases of the flight - half the cabin was in darkness from before taxiing and then for the entire flight including the landings. Isn't this a safety hazard when passengers are unable to see out of the aircraft in case of emergency? On the other hand I like the JAL First lounges in Narita and use of the Qantas First lounge in Sydney - excellent. Overall however a mixed experience saved by an upgrade to business on one sector - a different experience entirely.,Premium Economy,1,yes,109,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2013-11-10,Japan Airlines customer review,2,Could not check in online and select a seat with my partner we were assigned seats in opposite sides of the aircraft for some odd reason - despite being on the same booking. IFE rather poor unless you are Japanese Food was ok but both mine and my partner dietary requirement were not met. All other OneWorld airlines always okay. Seats are cramped and odd. The seat reclines but in an odd angle. Cabin was really hot. Overall not that satisfied with JAL and will double check if they are covering any leg of OneWorld ticket to avoid them.,Economy Class,1,no,110,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

Food was ok but it caters more for the Asian taste the 787 dreamliner is really a great one. NRT-PEK Economy Nov 20: I tried to check my luggage directly with JAL via PEK to CAI but JAL staff said they cannot do that which is very weird! Flight departed on time B767-200.

2014-01-10,Japan Airlines customer review,10,Flew from Narita to New York on JAL yesterday. The flight reconfirmed JAL as one of my favorite airlines. Traveling in economy class for some 14 hours with my wife and 16-month-old daughter was made most pleasant by the highly professional helpful and genuinely friendly crew. Unlike with carriers on this side of the globe the economy class food was actually quite good. Similarly all drinks - including champagne and cognac - were free of charge and served throughout the flight upon request. And already the check-in at Narita was a completely non- stressful event as there is a special check-in section for people traveling with children.,Economy Class,1,yes,115,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2014-01-20,Japan Airlines customer review,6,KMJ-HND on B738. Flight departed and arrived on time. No IFE but for Japanese radio. Seats were narrow with no lumbar support.

2014-02-11,Japan Airlines customer review,7,Singapore to Narita 767 1 Feb. Excellent flawless service. Very tasty food. But the servings could have been greater for a flight of nearly 7 hours.

2014-02-17,Japan Airlines customer review,8,Flew from Narita to Singapore on 5th February 2014. Boarding was systematic considering it was a full flight. Was looking forward to flying on the 787 but they change the equipment due to the maintenance conducted on the 787 fleet. Flight departed on time. Food was ok but the cabin crew were helpful in doing several rounds of drinks throughout the flight. Seat was comfortable but the only negative point on it was the entertainment box was situated beneath the seat in front which limits the legroom. I suppose this applies to the window seats of their 767 fleet. Love the feeling of flying on the 767 as it feels roomier with less pax per row 7 abreast in the 767 compared to 9 abreast in the 777. Would fly them again.,Economy Class,1,yes,118,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2014-03-06,Japan Airlines customer review,1,We were involved in the aircraft congestion in Haneda Airport due to the snow storms in early February and had to suffer a flight delay of some 34 hours. Despite the fact that we were issued boarding passes and therefore considered to be transit passengers in JAL's care custody and control no assistance by way of ground staff assistance or assistance with hotels or meals. When drinks were served the stewardess was reluctant to request the passenger in front to put his seat upright as 'he was sleeping' causing inconvenience and discomfort to the passengers in the following seats. Breakfast was some sort of unrecognisable stew totally unappetising with no choice whatsoever.,Economy Class,1,no,119,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

Food and service in Economy was excellent. I really appreciate the larger seats in the new 777 configuration. I'm a big man 260 and found I had ample room comfortable seat with all the inflight amenities possible.

2014-03-24,Japan Airlines customer review,9,"JFK-NRT JAL 005. B777-300ER - New JAL Sky Suite. Economy Class. Check in was smooth and easy at JFK. Being an AA Platinum Elite member (Sapphire leveling on One World carriers) it means an extension of preferred benefits network wide. What JAL does differently though is that it immediately includes Priority Boarding status and lounge access indication on your ticket which I found helpful and convenient. A bit of a slight negative in my praise if ever so little is that the lounge at JFK has seen better days and could use some sprucing up. I must say this was one of the most pleasurable flight experiences I've had in a long time having flown so far (14 hrs straight) and in economy class. What's impressive about what JAL's done is design a standard economy seat with comfort and practicality foremost. With a pitch of 34"" this has got to be one of the most generous legrooms in coach period. JAL takes Premium Economy to the next level with a whopping 42"" and a whole slew of other amenities. Meal service was also a big plus. Two full meals and a mid-flight snack were served. The initial meal after takeoff comprised of two different types of appetizers fruit salad slaw salad and your choice of entree. Very scrumptious. The meal on my return journey on a different airline Cathay Pacific was a scant offering by comparison. Inflight entertainment was fairly good though lacking a little in the variety of English language TV shows. Movies were excellent - several recently released Oscar nominated flicks were on feature. Also really enjoyed the cabin crew they were all very gracious and accommodating. Overall a very pleasurable experience.",Economy Class,1,yes,122,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

2014-03-28,Japan Airlines customer review,7,HKG to NRT and return JL736/735. After not having flown with them for over 20 years I was full of expectation and it was slightly disappointing. In terms of service and courtesy they were spot on! The English proficiency level of the cabin crew was more than satisfactory contrary to other reviews claiming they were hard to be understood. The business class was disappointing due to three aspects uncomfortable out of date recliner seat with remote control on the arm rest which could easily be triggered wrongly. Average food (in portion and taste) and average AVOD. It was evident to see Japan airlines were trying to cut cost by not providing 3 course meal served separately all was served on one tray which was rather cramped. The toilet is basic with the absence of toiletries such as hand cream or cologne which is a norm for most business class. General temperature of the aircraft a bit on the warm side rather uncomfortable for the 4 hours duration. However on a positive note one could see cabin crew did their best with the limited resources they have been given. On the ground check in staffs both in HK and Japan were excellent lounge in HK was just a shared one and in Narita we used the Sakura lounge which is spacious and comfortable. All in all it was clear that Japan airlines had her golden days but is now struggling to survive so they concentrate on the longer routes and give only the very basic to short haul routes. Given the cost I shall look elsewhere.,Business Class,1,yes,124,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

The shell seat is horrible (yes they are upgrading it over the course of the year) a Mini-Pillow for sleeping one size of ""flight sweater"" which looked like a ladies small. The first drink not put down until we were in the air for 70 minutes - quality of the food is OK - AVOD is geared strictly towards the Japanese market - they had most of the new releases but only 4 ""oldies"" and about 1 hour of non-movie programming in English.

No business class no duty free no AVOD. Granted it's a 1.5 hour flight but it was a blast from the past. We were seated in 2C/D which would normally be business but was their special extra room seating on this plane. Seat selection was available here online for no extra charge. It was a wider cloth seat with manual buttons. Service was pleasant for an Asian legacy carrier on this route. To be honest I expected more for this high value business route. The food was a chicken and mayonnaise sandwich in a box with some rice crackers and pineapple. Very simple. We departed and arrived on time without delays. The one surprise - they put as the farthest gate in the airport. Literally. Very end of Haneda down two giant hallways that took about 15 minutes of speed walking. As we booked last minutes our tickets were extremely expensive (750$ RT) so I do feel that for the price we paid that we could've had a slightly nicer (updated equipment) experience.,Premium Economy,1,yes,127,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

First the trans-pacific legs: ground staff excellent at both JFK and NRT super fast check in polite and welcoming. Sakura Lounge in JFK fine for a business class lounge decent supply of snacks and drinks. Lounge at NRT simply fantastic excellent private showers great drinks selection and good choice of hot dining options upstairs cafeteria style. Onboard hard product for these 773s are simply the best J class in the sky right now. Lay flat bed with airweave mattress pad allows for deep restive complete sleep. Privacy of window seats is unmatched couldn't see anyone else in the cabin or any leaking daylight from opened shades. Food is stellar especially the Japanese options. Loved the dine on demand ordering through the AVOD handset. FAs polite and friendly once you engage them although I noticed they were much more vocal and consistent with Japanese pax. Now for the negatives: service a bit slow during dining was forgotten for about 45 min while others were served then finally when given food salad course was skipped and remaining courses were incomplete (no bread had to ask for utensils etc). Sorry but having to ask for your food on a $6000 revenue ticket is a bit embarrassing for all parties involved. AVOD very limited. Cabin a bit warm but not unbearable. Also outbound IFE audio didn't work power outlet at seat broken JAL Sky WiFi inoperable until I did a little creative clicking around to get the login process to work. Little qualms that were negated by the immense comfort and privacy of the hard product. Overall the best way outside of F cabin to get to Japan.

2014-11-20,Japan Airlines customer review,7,Flew LAX-NRT-HKG r/t in Business. A mixed bag. The long haul between LAX and NRT features the new JAL business class suite. The seat itself is roomy and offers excellent privacy and it folds down into a comfortable flat horizontal bed. Unfortunately JAL has a tendency to overheat the cabin which interferes with sleep. On the return trip I solved the over-heating problem by accompanying the purser to the heat control to reduce the heat from the previously set 26 degrees (which is insanely hot). Meals were ok (had the Japanese selection). Champagne was excellent the rest of the wines inferior. Oddly no breakfast available on the overnight flight back to LAX. IFE had an excellent screen and the worst selection of films one could imagine. The flights between NRT and HKG were on a 767 with simply terrible seats. They were of the type which AA used 20 years ago in business class. IFE was primitive and awful.,Business Class,1,yes,140,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2014-12-01,Japan Airlines customer review,1,"The price for the service is too high. The customer service at this company seems to be a ""well you already booked so there is nothing you can do"" attitude. They are not willing to try to make any accommodations to their customers. Prices are higher than other better airlines. For an Asian based airline I was very disappointed. Inability to choose seats before the flight for certain booking codes is one thing but to allow it on one leg of the trip and not another is odd. After purchasing a RT ticket I was able to chose seats for the outbound flight. When I inquired about seats for the return trip I was told that the fare did not allow it. I even offered to pay to be able to select a seat and was told that I would have to pay over $600. $250 of that was a penalty for changing the ticket? Really? The representative seemed to be completely uninterested in trying to come to a reasonable solution. Since when is upgrading a ticket class worthy of a change penalty? I am sorry that I chose JAL.",Economy Class,1,no,141,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

2014-12-31,Japan Airlines customer review,10,JFK-NRT-ICN B787 and B767. Good service. Flight attendants were serving customers non-stop and always smiled. Inflight meal was fantastic twice the portion of any airline food in the US. The meals in JFK-NRT segments in economy class can compare to and exceed the quality of meals of any domestic flights business class meals within the United State. NRT-ICN economy class meals provided a meal box in commemoration of the 50th year of the launch of flights between Japan and Korea. The flight out of NRT was delayed because of the heavy rain and airlines are not usually responsible for weather delays but Japan Airlines provided two free shuttle from ICN to Seoul to compensate for the weather delay! What can you complain about that? Inflight entertainment is flawless as well and with the new seatings on B787 coming it will be updated to Magic VI.,Economy Class,1,yes,143,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2015-01-14,Japan Airlines customer review,10,JL008 from NRT to BOS on 31 Dec and JL007 back on 5 Jan. I flew with my wife son and daughter. I used to fly to BOS via ORD or IAD with UA their direct flight to Boston seemed the most attractive to me. It would shorten my trip by 5 hours. The result: superb service all around. On the return flight I skipped dinner because I couldn't resist my drowsiness. After 4 hours sleeping one of the flight attendants got me a meal plate amiably. What a service! Please remember I was in the economy cabin. The quality of inflight meal was nothing to be desired as far as it was served in economy. IFE was satisfactory to Japanese passengers however I got to know that it was not enough for native speakers of English. Seats were more than average with footrests. On-time departures and arrivals for both legs. They observed punctuality. Finally let me show you their improvement: when we were seated waiting for boarding at E3B gate of Logan JL FA's were passing by. Much to my surprise they made bows to us smiling which I wouldn't have experienced 30 years ago.,Economy Class,1,yes,144,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2015-01-30,Japan Airlines customer review,8,I made a return trip with JAL from London Heathrow (LHR) Terminal 3 to Tokyo Haneda (HND) in late November/early December 2014. The equipment on both legs was a 777 and I was in Business Class. It was my first experience of JAL long haul having used them a couple of times for domestic travel within Japan and overall I was pleasantly surprised. The FA on both flights a mixture of Japanese and Europeans were attentive friendly and efficient. The meals were good although they were understandably targeted at the Japanese palate. The IFE was also good with big flat screens in Business Class and touch screen controllers. Overall the cabin was excellent with a very comfortable flat bed a decent amount of space and unobstructed access to your seat irrespective of its location. The only slight negative was the fact that the middle seat in each row (which have a 2x3x2 configuration) that I had on both legs can feel rather isolated with its high partitions either side and the over head bins above. Service at HND was excellent too benefiting from the brand new international terminal facilities. The JAL Business Class Lounge was clean comfortable and reasonably quiet. Unfortunately when leaving LHR JAL passengers have to use the BA Lounge in the terminal which is small cramped and crowded. Both flights boarded and departed on time.,Business Class,1,yes,145,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

2015-03-28,Japan Airlines customer review,9,JL5 / JL711 JFK-NRT-SIN. Excellent service on both sectors from exceedingly courteous and warm crew. Departures were right on the nose and arrivals close to on time. The legroom is a real winner allowing you to stretch out and there were no underseat obstruction from any IFE box. Puts most of the other carriers on this route to shame. Cabin toilets and seats were generally well maintained if not immaculate on the 777 and 767. Both had the Sky wider economy cabins. Meals were well portioned tasty and well presented. A little snack bar set up in both galleys on the transpacific. The crew were always present in the cabin which was impressive. I couldn't fault the crew at all. The only 2 points that detracted from the terrific experience were the actual seat cushioning and the IFE. While the legroom was excellent the seat design great - the seat cushioning itself felt hard quite soon into the trip to NRT. Perhaps pack a seat pad if you go. The IFE system was quick and responsive but I found the selections a little limited compared to other airlines. WiFi was available on both flights but I didn't take advantage of it. Would certainly fly JAL again for the price service and connections.,Economy Class,1,yes,148,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

2015-04-06,Japan Airlines customer review,10,I cannot praise this airline or its staff enough. On my trip to Japan I was treated with respect the food was good stewards very friendly and the in-flight selection of movies was great. On my return trip the flight from Aomori to Tokyo was a domestic flight and a blizzard had delayed my flight a couple of hours or so. Ground staff spoke little to no English however they did their best to make sure I felt comfortable and help me make my flight home to Tokyo. We arrived in Tokyo with less than 25 minutes before my flight to San Francisco took off I needed to get to the international terminal. The stewardess' tag-team sprinted me to the bus station rode the bus with me to the airport and dragged me through security.

2015-04-08,Japan Airlines customer review,8,Flew NRT-YVR night flight on 787. Departure delayed by a couple of tardy business class pax then we taxied around for nearly 1 hour before take-off because we missed our slot. Dinner was excellent and just as I was thinking an ice cream would really top this off they came round with ice cream except if you had ordered a special meal then you aren't eligible! (luckily some other people declined so they found me one but why skimp on this?). Breakfast was a bit minimal. Recaro seats not too bad but the footrest is annoying and a couple more inches of leg room would have been nice. IFE excellent selection and nice big screen but touch screen functions hardly ever worked. Overall a good experience I would fly JAL again.,Economy Class,1,yes,152,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan

The cabin was too hot just adding to the sense of claustrophobia. The service and food was ok but because of the large number of cramped passengers the trays were slow to be removed.

Really pleasantly surprised by JAL. 787 from PEK-HND was brand new great plane fantastic IFE selection (esp for a 3hr flight) friendly cabin crew and best economy class food I've eaten in a long time. Not sure what others are complaining about in terms of legroom I'm 5'11 and don't usually fly Economy but this was fine more legroom than I'm used to in Europe. Domestic Japan flights decent no meal but friendly FAs and drinks offered.

My wife son and I are currently sitting in the Qantas lounge at Narita airport as we transit to Taipei from Boston. Why are we in the Qantas Lounge a 10 minute walk from the JAL gates rather than the JAL lounge even though our entire return journey from Taipei to Boston was with JAL? Because the ""friendly"" staff at the JAL lounge informed me that even though I am a Platinum Oneworld member (of which JAL is a partner) I can only bring one guest into the lounge even if the second guest is my 8 year old son! Both Cathay and Qantas have shown common sense whenever we use their lounges allowing the three of us to enter.

2015-04-20,Japan Airlines customer review,5,Flew on a JAL 787 to Ho Chi Minh City and back last week and I was very disappointed. The seating was cramped with minimal legroom and on a 5 hour plus flight it was uncomfortable. On both flights I was seated in 25D which was an aisle seat and I found it very difficult to get comfortable and had to repeatedly get up and move around to stretch my legs. the IFE is good but breakfast that was served prior to arrival was poor. 2 hours before landing at Ho Chi Minh City it was fruit yoghurt juice salad and a gooey gelatinous sauce thing with broccoli included and I did not eat it. On the way back and again 2 hours before landing at Tokyo Haneda it was fish rice porridge and I left that as well. There was no choice for breakfast and quite honestly I thought it was of a very poor standard.,Economy Class,1,no,157,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2015-04-23,Japan Airlines customer review,8,After Finnair you wonder how the latter could still be in OneWorld Alliance. B787 NRT-HEL economy class. Legroom and seat width were still somewhat limited but the quality of meals service and entertainment is light years ahead of Finnair. Even had metal cutlery! The food was good but superbly presented. Would really like to see what they supply in business or first class (I can dream). One downside is the limited choice of snacks between meals. Oh and the dinner was a DIY burger (from MOSBurger) - tasty but given the limited space constructing the thing required some level of contortionism. Overall not quite as good a Cathay (fresh fruit in snacks please) but would still recommend.,Economy Class,1,yes,158,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2015-04-24,Japan Airlines customer review,9,JL712 / JL4 SIN-NRT-JFK. Just arrived last night after the long haul from Singapore. Impressed as I was on the outbound with JAL. Above all they are extremely punctual. Both flights pushed back on time and arrived early. Boarding was organized and ground staff as polite and courteous as their cabin crew. I was really looking forward to flying on the new Sky Wider Economy 787 to JFK. Was a little disappointed despite the hype about the plane as it felt a little less spacious than on the Sky Wider 767 and 777. Nonetheless exceptional legroom efficient and smiling service all the way. On the Leg to JFK service seemed a little slower but no less attentive. Meals and snacks fine tasty and well presented. Yes even the Air MosBurger. The only downsides same as on the outbound - the seat cushion wears a little hard quite quickly and the movie selections should be expanded to have more international content and certainly more TV shows at least. All in all I'd fly them again with no hesitation. The great service on the ground and in the air and the fast connections to Asia from the east coast are hard to beat.,Economy Class,1,yes,159,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2015-05-12,Japan Airlines customer review,9,Flew BKK-HND 6 hours or so flight time. After that again on domestic flights from HND-OKA and back for a mileage run. International leg: Round trip (HND-BKK). The way there was a 787-800 flight and it was fantastic. Food was fine staff was excellent. Always lets everyone know when the seatbelt signs would turn on and asks everyone to tend to their business before turning them on. The food (clam chowder) wasn't perfect but that's understandable didn't expect it to taste perfect after 4 hours on the plane and served as breakfast. The way back was better with rice and egg+meat. Overall the seat spacing weren't very spacious but what I remember of them was their punctuality. All flights I took (8 flights) were all on time. Domestic: round trip (HND-OKA). Overall was good. Would be better with some food to it but since its domestic didn't expect much. Seats were perfect. Very spacious and with a 1000 yen (10 USD or less) upgradable to Class J (domestic version of business class) and that was perfect for price and value. Overall very satisfied.

2015-05-20,Japan Airlines customer review,10,Flew BKK-KIX-LAX-KIX-BKK in economy class All 4 flights were on Dreamliners and this was one of the best airline experiences I ever had. Check in was easy at both Bangkok and LAX the windows were open when I arrived and the line was short. The smaller plane made check-in boarding and exiting the plane far easier than with a larger plane and I liked the interior of the Dreamliner. I'm 194cm tall and was able to get a bulkhead or emergency exit seat of 3 of the 4 flights at no extra charge The staff performance and courtesy was flawless the food was good and even in economy class they said you could order anything off the menu any time you want. My flight from KIX to LAX was delayed 2 hours since they had to reposition a plane but I was paged and given a 1500 Yen meal voucher and an apology.

Outbound flight was fairly dismal from check in where the agent tried to tell me I had only paid for 2/3 of the ticket? To the very worn 777 with pathetic legroom and service (only non alcoholic drinks offered in paper cup). On time was the best I could say. The second leg was an improvement with no attempted rip off at check in but the new (ish) 737-800 was cramped 2/3 seating in business class and the same pathetic paper cup offerings.

Staff were very polite though. On board staff were very polite and friendly. The safety instruction video was very poor. Missed a lot of the details usually included. We were served a lunch 2 hours after take-off. Food was decent I went for the Japanese meal. A decent main course with a number of small sides and ice cream for dessert. Good drinks selection. Throughout the flight crew were available with drinks and snacks. 2 hours before landing we were served dinner which consisted of a DIY hamburger. That was very disappointing and not what you would expect from a major international carrier. Entertainment selection was very poor with just a few films and tv programmes to choose from.

The check in gate for the connecting flight had closed and the ground staff could have asked me to carry my own luggage but instead helped arrange for my luggage to be brought up the plane by the airport staff, and gave me good and clear instructions on how to get to the domestic terminal. My return flight from Osaka to Tokyo was supposed to be at Kansai Airport, but I overlooked it and went to Itami instead. The ground staff at Itami helped arrange my partner and I to be on the next flight out from Itami to Haneda, even though they could have asked me to travel to Kansai for my flight instead. The seating space was just okay, nothing to commend or complain about. Choice of shows and movies in the inflight entertainment was a little low, not as many choices as other airlines I've flown.

I ordered the gluten free meal and got exactly what I wanted. Staff were nice, boarding was efficient, and never a minute late. Only thing to say is the IFE, low selection of movies as well as songs (can't blame them as Japan is almost half a decade slow in releasing movies). Food was good.

I was very satisfied with everything including cabin crew service, flight meals, seat pitch, but only except inflight entertainment system, movie selections to be specific. The movies were a little bit outdated with limited western selections, but would be ideal for Japanese passengers since half of the movies are Japanese. JAL used B767 for its NRT-PVG route, and most passengers appeared to be Chinese tourists traveling with kids. The boarding process was a bit chaotic and the flight was full. The A/C on this segment was outrageously strong, and I was frozen sitting on a window seat. The flight attendant was very considerate after I told her this problem. Again, the cabin service was excellent; meal was good, but the inflight entertainment system was a bit old but still acceptable. I would definitely fly them again, for its top-notch service.

The seat was hard and uncomfortable, however legroom was decent and the u-shaped pillow was nice. The seat pockets barely stretch, so they cannot be used to store anything other than thin objects, not even the water bottle they provide pre-flight. Food below average compared to other airlines. The SFO-HND route featured chicken sandwich as a snack and chicken porridge for breakfast. HND-SFO route featured a tuna melt as a snack (that sounds like a recipe for disaster, right?) and a corn soup / cream of broccoli mixture. I was expecting more, having flown ANA and United in the past. Note that you can look up the inflight meal on their website. For IFE there was a personal tv on the back of each seat, with a decent selection of movies and television programming, though not as much as on Delta flights that I have been on. I slept on the flight, so I didn't watch too much tv, but there were some recent movies from early 2015. Service was nothing special. FA was friendly, but failed to collect the plastic beverage cups and trash after the first beverage service. She walked by and picked up the cups to the right of aisle, but failed to collect any of the cups on the other side despite the fact that the empty cups with trash were on the tray table.

In Tokyo, I was absolutely dreading my return flight home on these seats. To mitigate the discomfort, I purchased an inflatable ""donut ring"" cushion and sat on that on the flight home. If you take JAL, please consider bringing an inflatable cushion along. The USB charger outlets that are so prominently advertised as a great feature of the Dreamliner do not work. On both flights, I tried the outlets at my seat and my husbands and asked several fellow passengers if j could try theirs. I tried at least 7 or 8 outlets on both flights. They do not work.

A very special ""Thank You"" to maintenance staff at the Manila airport. Long story short, my glasses went under my seat in Business Class and they found them. During the flight the flight attendants did all they could to help me find my glasses and when we did not find them, they called Manila prior to our arrival and had a maintenance staff member meet us at the gate. Unfortunately, after about 15 minutes of removing panels and searching, the glasses were not found. Maintenance staff promised he would continue to take things apart and do all that he could to find my glasses. He found them and I was able to pick them up at the JAL office in Manila prior to my flight departure the next day.

Very little pieces of beef on top of bad tasting rice. All that branding and catering research is lost on the actual meal. Lady sitting next me stared at her mess of Air Yoshinoya meal and ate only the bread, salad and dessert. Crew members are typical Japanese crew, polite and hard working.

The Boeing 787 is a great plane on which to fly economy, and Japan Airlines 8 across seating makes it even more pleasant. The Boeing 777-300 between LAX and NRT was also clean and comfortable.

I asked the staff numerous times that the temperature was too hot, but they kept saying, ""It's on 24, so we can try put it down to 23 degrees"". I'm sorry, but 24 is too hot.

Comfortable both seated and when lowered to the fully flat bed. JAL supplies a lightweight cushion so that the seat becomes softer when sleeping. JAL has a tendency to overheat their cabins. Knowing this I requested the purser on both long hauls to lower the cabin temp in our zone, which she did.  Such an improvement. Quality of the food is fine, but JAL really skimps on the SFO-HND route, evidently since in both directions the departure is after midnight. I simply ordered the Japanese breakfast right at the start of the flight and ate it then. The Haneda Sakura lounge is very modern, good food, good wifi, nice showers. Perfect and changing planes there was a pleasure. On the other hand, the San Francisco Sakura lounge is pitiful. Overcrowded, terrible food, frankly an embarrassment.

Huge TV screens (23inch), excellent Bose noise cancelling headphones, quality amenity bags (Tumi and Zero Haliburton), good and improving selections of entertainment options. If I were to quibble, Japan Airlines could improve their amenity bags by providing better skincare products and provide a larger and thicker pillow.

2016-04-26,"""service which is becoming rare""",10,"✅ Verified Review |  I had one of the most pleasant flying experience with Japan Airlines from New York JFK to Tokyo Narita. I had heard about their Boeing 777 Sky Wider Economy seating, with only 9 abreast (opposed to commonly used 10 abreast) and a generous seat width and pitch, plus some other nice features. I always wondered if an inch or two here or there really count. I was wrong. It does matter and with one less seat in a row, made an enormous difference on this 13+ hours flight. A pre-meal drink service was followed by a 7 dish lunch, including miso soup and ice cream. Another meal was served before landing. What set them apart was the staff who were caring, polite and courteous. The kind of service which is becoming rare or found only in premium cabins. They made numerous rounds with drinks during the flight. I saw them caring for babies and observed one of the crew making an origami for them in the galley. Entertainment system was adequate with high quality screen displays. Announcements in English could be clearer. My Oneworld Sapphire status (AA Platinum) was fully acknowledged at the check-in counter and other ground services.",Economy Class,1,yes,214,1,1,1,1,Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,JFK to NRT,April 2016,1,,Japan Airlines,Japan

Business class forward cabin looked cramped, although fresh and spotless. 7-across angle-flat seating is surely now outdated and was not very comfortable, especially with the seat itself being quite hard. Not really a problem for a daytime flight, but I would be very unhappy to find this layout on the inward overnight flight. Reasonable IFE selection but small screen. My main complaint is the lunch service. With limited main course selection taken at take-off and the first course not delivered until an hour later, you'd think the service from then on would be relatively speedy. Not so! A full 40-minute wait between the first two courses is quite unforgivable, the more so when I had to return my steak as it was not even lukewarm! Thereafter the flight was uneventful, although it was all but impossible to hear the cabin service announcements.

2016-07-06,"""not a pleasant experience""",5,"✅ Verified Review |  Tokyo Narita to Sydney. My first issue arose when attempting to check-in online within the prescribed period. The JAL system would not allow me to complete check-in, advising I had to contact my travel agent. This was bizarre, as my ticket was purchased from JAL direct! At Narita Airport I was directed to the Premium Economy check-in. When I presented myself at the counter to which I was directed, the staff  told me they were closed, and took me to another counter which was also closed! Staff subsequently turned up and completed my check-in, however, the check-in process was disorganised. Flight departed on schedule. Food quality was of a poor standard. I had expected better from JAL when departing from their home base. I had also expected to find some typical Japanese dishes on the menu, but they were absent. Flight was not comfortable, as the crew had the climate turned up and it was way too hot and made it too uncomfortable to sleep. Most passengers in PE were visibily hot, as people removed all but necessary clothing and didn't use the aircraft blankets - requests for reduction in cabin temperature were ignored. Initially I presumed that to acclimatise us to the colder weather in Sydney they would reduce cabin temperature as we approached Sydney, the ambient temperature in Sydney being 6C. However, this was not the case. I was still sweating when I left the terminal and went into the open air. Flight arrived on schedule, however, disembarkation was very slow to be implemented and seemed disorganised. I understand that First and Business Class have priority, however, there was a long delay to allow others to disembark after all the First and Business class passengers had long since disappeared into the terminal. Overall, not a pleasant experience on this flight with JAL. On the basis of this flight, I could not recommend JAL to others.",Premium Economy,1,no,219,1,1,1,1,Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,NRT to SYD,June 2016,1,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2016-07-06,"""found JAL PE to be sub-standard""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  Ticket purchased online with Japan Airlines. Process is easy and allows check-in up to 72 hours prior to scheduled departure. Check-in at airport was quick and efficient, staff helpful and friendly. Flight from Sydney to Narita departed early, as all passengers and crew were ready to embark. Wi-fi only available gratis in Business or First Class, or for a charge if you are in Premium Economy or Economy providing you have an account with JAL. Catering was of a good standard, with reasonable selection of food, drinks and snacks. Flight was smooth, with pleasant climate maintained inside the aircraft. Arrival was ahead of schedule and disembarkation was well organised. Overall, having experienced Premium Economy (PE) with CX, I found the JAL PE to be sub-standard. Apart from the PE seats in JAL and a separate check-in counter, the catering, baggage allowance, etc.. is exactly the same as Economy. Considering the new Economy seats in JAL, I believe Economy is much better value for money. Maybe CX PE experience has spoiled me!

Can't say the say for the return trip from Bangkok to Tokyo Haneda, we flew an older 777 with tiny AV screens that were small and hard to see. Leg space was cramped and not as generous as our trip on the newer aircraft flown into BKK. Although the return trip was uneventful it was unpleasant as the aircraft was so worn I was surprised it was in the JL fleet.

We had to change airports in Tokyo but it was worth it for the ticket price because they have reliable and not too expensive bus service between airports. Overall, flying with JAL was a good experience. The legroom in economy class was plentiful and the seats were comfortable. Flight attendant service was good as well and there was a decent selection of movies to watch on seat back monitors. My complaint is that the food on flights between SF to Tokyo didn't seem adequate for a 10 hour flight, which is long. They provided 1 full meal and 1 little dinky (tiny!) sandwich with no condiments, so remember to bring snacks. The lack of condiments on the sandwich and the fact that it was cold made it extremely dry and barely edible. On the other hand, the full meal they served were good, my only complaint being that they did not heat up the bread rolls. I've flown on many trans pacific flights between the US and Asia with other airlines and they have always provided 2 full meals. But as a whole, the JAL flying experience was quite nice and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.

On outbound flight they did not place us sitting together even though booked under one reference and requested to sit together a month in advance of travel, had to complain at the gate in order to get seats assigned together.

They were not only extremely friendly, quick and punctual, the seats were comfortable the crew had some humor, the entertainment system was easy to use (no annoying pressing 100 times until the movie plays) and the window brightness could be regulated which was an amazing alternative to the blinds in case one wants to sleep but the other wants to enjoy the view. Controllable sunglasses for the window - first time I saw that. Also they served some nice and good food including Milka chocolate, ice cream from Häagen Dasz and a ""Bauer"" yoghurt. We all know these are great brands. The service couldn't be better - and always a smile on their face, which makes you feel even better while travelling. The poor English didn't bother me at all.

I opted for the western but the meal bore no resemblance whatsoever to a western breakfast and was mostly inedible. The overall service level was average at best. For the return flight to Singapore we flew from Narita but as in the same flight taken earlier this year the plane was almost an hour late in departing due to heavy traffic around 6pm. Passengers should also be reminded that the walk from the JAL lounge is around 15 minutes as the gate used for this flight is the furthest away on the particular pier that's used.

2016-11-22,"""high expectations were never quite met""",6,"✅ Verified Review | Shanghai to San Diego via Tokyo. Everything you read ranks Japan Airlines at the top, so I decided to try them as the last leg of a OneWorld round the world trip. Also, I could fly into my hometown of San Diego rather than the usual grind of landing in LA and driving south. From the start, I had high expectations that were never quite met. The flight from Shanghai to Tokyo was short and unmemorable which is interesting, because I always enjoy the Shanghai to Tokyo flight on ANA. I had higher hopes for the Tokyo - San Diego flight based not the least on the airframe, the B787 Dreamliner. This is my favorite plane. I typically try to exclusively fly this if possible due to the reduce noise, lower pressurization and, typically, newer configured cabins. For JAL, the latter was a huge let down. Not that the cabin was old. It was very new, but the seats were the reclining type, not the lay-flat and in today's business class, that is simply not competitive for a 12 hour flight. Outside of the seat's limited recline, the overall pod was comfortable with storage in all the right places. The entertainment system was also very good. Overall, it was a comfortable seating area, but with no lay-flat, when it was time to sleep, JAL failed. While I was awake, though, the service was excellent. The attendants were attentive and professional and were always around to help. The food was very good, as well. I can see why JAL is rated well as an airline, but the absence of lay-flat seats will put them out of the running for me as a carrier.

A cabin crew member will rush over to see what you need. Plenty of good food and beverages served throughout the flight. Think you're thirsty? Well, a cabin attendant just happens to walk by with juice or water. The economy seats we had were very comfortable, even for the long journeys we had. The 787 is a wonderful airplane to fly in.

2017-01-05,"""my chosen option for this route""",10,"✅ Verified Review |  Absolutely the best Tokyo to Sydney option. It does use Narita as opposed to Haneda, but JAL certainly makes up for the slight inconvenience due to the distance to the city. Firstly their fare is cheaper than Qantas, and even the Jetstar flight via the Gold Coast. Secondly their luggage allowance is more generous (23kg x 2 check-in) so it was a nice surprise to be able to relax at the airport baggage-free. Thirdly their staff, both ground and air, were so competent. They were efficient and knew not to disturb you unnecessarily, while keeping the signature Japanese Omotenashi mind. Also they serve you plenty of drinks and quality food, with warm breakfast. I did think the flavour was too much to the Japanese liking (e.g. they served rice-featured breakfast and no other options, if I'm not mistaken), but it was one of the best economy class meals around.  could not stress more how wonderful the spaciousness of the ""JAL Sky Wider"" seat arrangement was.  The only complaint is the range of movies and TV shows shown. Qantas offers more alternatives than JAL and ANA's typical blockbusters and Friends. Overall, JAL will be my chosen option in the future for this route, unless Qantas lowers their price, as I'm their FF member.

I can't usually sleep much on flights but on this one slept for around 5 hours. Food is standard economy (with a few extras such as champagne) but good in terms of both quantity and quality.

Though ""designed"" to look fancy, everything tasted terrible. I'd say ""regular"" meal that you'd expect on economy class by other airlines would be far better.

And cabin crew on board came and spoke to me at different times of the flight to ask how I was feeling and if I needed anything. As the flight wasn't full they also asked the lady next to me to move to the next seat over to give us both extra room - she was happy to oblige. At the end of the flight, I was given a little gift for my new baby which had some toys and also a little JAL model plane. The crew had written a personal message to me offering their congratulations with all the details of that days flight written on it - a lovely keepsake. The food is of a high standard for airline food and they presented a picture menu so you could make your decision more easily. The toilets were kept clean and well stocked.

I usually fly premium or business, but since the flight was only 3 hours 40 minutes going down and 3 hours coming back, I decided to save money and fly economy. At Haneda, the economy check-in line was long but moved rather quickly. The staff were professional and it was running smoothly. The crew onboard were wonderful on both legs. The food was good quality. I'm XXL and legroom is usually a problem, but it wasn't so bad on this aircraft. However, the seats seem a bit low and there was blockage under the seat with AVOD boxes, so it wasn't really comfortable overall. The cushions were thin. The aircraft is a 787, but it must be one of the oldest! If you paid for a staggard, lie-flat bed in business, you'd be sorely disappointed as they are the old neo shell seats. The interior was not the great ""wider seats"" they advertise and the AVOD was rather limited. I think if you are Japanese (or are fluent in Japanese) you'd be happy, but it was a rather lame assortment of major Hollywood blockbuster features with few interesting selections.

You get designated check-in, priority luggage check, and access to the Sakura Lounge at Narita. Because it was a late night flight, people like myself were eating full meals in the lounge in order to skip the late night dinner service onboard. Plenty to choose from: teriyaki chicken over rice, their famous beef curry over rice, dim sum, soup, sandwiches, and Thai curry were some of the choices. We also got a massage and a shower in before boarding the aircraft. Of course, people did eat on board, too, which consisted of a posh Tokyo ""yoshoku"" chain called Shiseido Parlour and while I didn't eat anything, the meals definitely looked better than your average economy meal. The seats are a little hard after 5 hours and the recline is the slide type which many people dislike, but since I can't sleep on planes anyway, it didn't bother me. There is ample space both in width and in leg room. The service is flawless. The AVOD was adequate. A smooth flight going over. Coming back, the 787 was even better. The toilet in economy with a washlet was a welcome treat. There were two babies traveling in the front row of premium and they were treated like kings! The older flight attendants doted over them the entire flight with special meals, chatting, games and toys, and of course bassinets.

The bathroom had a padded drop-down floor and seat so that you didn’t have to stand on the floor or toilet to change! Then all five staff working in First Class bowed and introduced themselves, and the Japanese 9-cousre menu started shortly after take-off. Many fine champagnes and sakis were offered and enjoyed, as well as the offer of the entire Japanese menu after mentioning that I had not tried many Japanese cuisines. As there were only two people occupying the 8-seat First Class cabin, the crew made up the suite opposite into a bed for me so I could sleep when it suited me. After about 3 hours of sleep they asked me if I wanted more food and drink. Nearing arrival, I was presented with a bag containing a Business Class amenity kit (having complimented them on the First Class Porsche Design kit, and they wanted me to have a Zero Halliburton one), some Japanese photos and two bottles of water for my onward journey.

I was so tired because of two nights no sleep and stress out because I have 6 days left for my vacation. That’s was a very bad experience with the way JAL treat their customer.

2018-03-28,"""was really disappointed""",6,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo Narita to Vancouver on Boeing 787-8 in Economy. Was looking forward to this flight but was really disappointed. The aircraft is one of the first generation 787 and although it's not that old, it felt that way onboard. IFE is using Magic V on this particular aircraft, there was limited content and only few New Releases. Response time is good on the touch screen. Food is the part that I was most excited about but it turned out to be my biggest disappointment. It was probably my high expectation based on the promise of ""Collaboratively-designed menus by 6 young talented chef"" according to their website. I appreciated the metal cutlery though. The food itself tasted bland. The side dishes are OK and the miso soup was a nice touch but oh so salty.There are only 2 meal service and the last one does not give you a choice but the Soba was ok. They also does not give the whole can of Soda unless you ask for it specifically. Flight Crew - very polite, smiles a lot and efficient. Seat felt cramped and I'm only 165CM. When the passenger in front of me reclined her seat, the backseat TV was almost touching my face. Overall, the experience was not horrible. Would I fly JAL again? Most likely if the fare is good, but will bring my own food just to be on the safe side.",Economy Class,1,no,281,1,1,1,1,Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Tokyo Narita to Vancouver,March 2018,1,,Japan Airlines,Japan
2018-04-06,"""seats were wide and comfortable""",8,"✅ Trip Verified | JAL didn't disappoint for the most part. The check-in at Haneda was fast and accommodating. I say accommodating because they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination on American Airlines connecting flight, despite the fact that these were two separate tickets. It seems a small thing, but it was major for me as JFK is a nightmare to connect through. On top of that, the agent gave me my boarding pass for the American flight! Onboard both directions the seats were wide and comfortable. I'm very large and I didn't feel particularly cramped or hindered even when in full recline. The seat cushions themselves are a bit thin, but they do have the extra air weave pads to help with this. Looking around the cabin, you can't help but feel it needs a refresher, but it is perfectly comfortable. The service onboard was kind and fast! They have an onboard order as you like service after the main meal and the food comes to you incredibly fast. The handset ordering function for this food was broken/unavailable both directions, but the response time of the FA was speedy. The food was good and you will not starve. However, if you are particular about your diet in any way, you may wish to order special meals. The western and the Japanese meals one way both featured beef which I don't eat. With the large a la carte menu it is easy enough to work around, but I found the set menus of the first meals to be really limited. AVOD was adequate and better than I remembered. Luggage delivery on the return from JFK was very slow, even for priority service.

It represents great value for money when compared to other premium Asian carriers who  charge 40-50% more for the same product / route. Haneda is a great airport and ground services are in line with any major international airport. Once onboard, one was greeted with warm smiles and friendly approachable service. In flight amenities are within expectation for J, with a (mouth) moisture mask, eye mask, toothbrush, hairbrush and ear plugs. Additionally a pyjama top  is also handed out sometime before or after meal service; as well as a refreshing eye moisture freshening mask before landing. Oddly though, the pyjama vest was offered to me on the day flight back but not the red eye going into TYO. As for the most crucial component of the flight, the herringbone arranged seat - cushion comfort is better than SQ though one still struggles with the non-linear layout somewhere between the pelvis (protruded by the outer front shell) and the left (or right depending on yr location) ankle position which comes into contact with the inner wall curvature. Food wise, the Japanese meal set was excellent- sushi and accompaniments were top notch and fresh. One could also enjoy premium arabica coffee, and on demand cup noodle snacks if needed.

The return flight was during the day and was mostly excellent. Highlights are the excellent service and the food. Just wonderful. Unfortunately, there are lows and they related to hardware and software. The seat is comfortable, however my window seat had almost no storage space except for among the magazines next to the screen (see pic). The IFE is truly sub-standard.

2018-08-01,"""one of the best carriers""",9,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time traveling with Japan Airlines and  I could not have been more happier. I made sure to arrive early to check in as me & my partner could not find any seats together. Upon talking to the check in staff they were able to give us a free upgrade to premium economy in order to compensate not being able to have me and my partner seated together on our booked economy fare. I was so shocked by the kindness and sincere empathy the check in staff had in regards to my situation. It was definitely an amazing start to the trip. Apart from being upgraded, JAL's amazing service continued to shine through its efficient ground staff, seat product and service on board. My first encounter with Japanese efficiency transpired with JAL's extremely fast and efficient boarding process. I was one of the first to board and it felt like 5 minutes after I sat down we were already on pushback, boarding literally took about 10 minutes which was amazing for a full flight. Boarding being done quickly meant we had a prompt ahead of schedule departure which was fantastic knowing how busy Sydney Airport can get traffic wise during the morning rush. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Also, the cabin seemed extremely clean. The toilets were clean and hygienic. During meal service, staff were generous with the food & beverage offerings. Food is never an aspect of air travel I like, however, Japan Airlines offers a range of food options throughout the flight and you can pick up or ask for fresh food like instant noodles, chips, biscuits and chocolate. I couldn’t stomach the lunch service, however the instant noodles were a life saver. There was also regular hot towels distributed through the flight which made it a nice touch. One interesting observation I made was the lack of odour in the cabin. You know that strong aroma you get during the food service in which kind of makes you want to gag (well... at least for me)? Or when the cabin crew usually run drinks service and the whole cabin gets infused with the horrible bitterness of bad coffee? Well there was none of that here, It was very pleasant. I found JAL's IFE to be one of the most responsive I have experienced. The flight map is so interactive and explorable. You can zoom in and out of the map and get detailed views of your flight path. The entertainment selection was also excellent and there are movies in over 20 languages! Being onboard the Boeing 787 also meant the windows are big and the electronic tint provides a calming ambiance to the cabin. This is matched with the soft warm white lighting which was turned on after lunch so people could relax. And later on the flight when the lights were turned off a gentle purple illuminated the ceiling.  Overall, Japan Airlines proved to be one of the best carriers I have ever chosen to fly with. From the moment of check in to disembarkation, Japan Airlines truly lived up to my expectations of being a 5 star Skytrax airline.",Premium Economy,1,yes,288,1,1,1,1,Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Sydney to Tokyo,July 2018,1,,Japan Airlines,Japan

My goodness, I'm a big person (183 cm tall and 230 kg), and even I was comfortable! I couldn't believe the legroom and the seat width of these wider seats. They are premium economy standard on many US airlines but extended to the entire economy class. On the downside, JAL is notorious for keeping the planes warm since Japanese are adverse to air conditioning and even air passing over their skin. I always take a fan to keep cool.

2018-10-05,"""my choice over the Pacific""",9,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Bangkok via Tokyo. I love JAL, they are my go to choice over the Pacific.  I purchased a not-particularly discounted one way ticket on JAL through Expedia. I didn't realize that advance seat selection wasn't possible on this class of service, and Expedia didn't mention it. Here's where I became quite disappointed. I'm elite on a partner airline with JAL. When seats are assigned, generally elites get processed first--window or aisle. Not only did I get middle seats, I was inexplicably given a middle seat in the very last row on my second segment, on a flight that had many empty rows. That's not only odd, it's vindictive. Someone (or some software) went out of its way to put me in a middle seat in the last row when there were dozens of better seats available. When I arrived at the airport, I was able to get the connecting flight adjusted, but the trans-Pacific segment was full, with no remaining aisle or window seats, and no upgrades available for purchase. The ticket agent offered to put my name on a list to move me to a new seat. Here's where JAL won me back. I presumed that this ""list"" functioned in the same way it would with US carriers, it got me to shut up and go away, but no one actually pays attention to it. That's where I was wrong. Within 15 minutes I had been moved to a window seat. Now, the rest of the trip was standard JAL. Massive amounts of pretty good food and wine. Fast service with a smile. On time departures and arrivals. Clean aircraft. Let's not forget to mention that JAL only put 8 seats across on its 787s, compared to the 9 that most of their competitors have. More room, more breathable air, and more overhead space. The seats were comfy and had a surprising amount of recline - like ""feel guilty for going back this far"" recline. The entertainment came up a bit short for 17 hours in the air, and curses on the person who offers up 75% of a bingeworthy season of a tv show and leaves us hanging. Narita is weirdly depressing and in desperate need of a facelift, but that was a 90 minute connection and certainly not a reason to avoid JAL.

The Sushi counter is great, but not at 9 am, overall, the JAL first lounge was rather dissapointing. This impression continued for the flight itself. The B789 had the so called Sky Suites III installed, which do not come even close to Qatar’s Qsuite, which I had the pleasure to fly last week. They are very narrow and uncomfortable.

On all legs the cabin crew were great - very welcoming, responsive to requests and eager to please. All flights operated on time. The seating was fine, though there is very little storage space in the B787 business class seat. In Melbourne JAL uses the Marhaba lounge, which is OK but offers no hot vegetarian food options. At Haneda airport the JAL Sakura lounge has great views of the runway, but food and drink choices were very limited (tea, coffee, soft drinks and rice crackers only). No welcome drink prior to take-off was offered on any sector, but after take-off the cabin crew were very efficient in meeting any requests. Unfortunately the vegetarian meals were never Japanese, and ranged from bland to unpleasant (I'm thinking of a certain vegetarian hamburger). On board the domestic flight from Haneda to Osaka Kansai the seat was very comfortable and the service was excellent - but only tea, coffee and soft drinks (no snack) were served. JAL does not help business class passengers or provide tickets for the transfer between Narita and Haneda airports in Tokyo. You have to make your own way.

Great drinks selection, including champagne - FA's happily kept it flowing. Food wasn't too bad, and loads of snacks like noodle pots. Transit in Tokyo, Narita to Haneda by Bus took only 80 minutes.

The seats on plane (both segments on Boeing 787) from Jakarta to Narita we’re far superior than seat from Narita to Vancouver. Cabin staff on both legs were all very friendly, very professional and deserve high marks. The inflight entertainment options were somewhat limited compared to other carriers. Headsets also not as comfortable as others (small headphones). The food was very good as was beverage selection. We’d both recommend JAL business class.

2019-02-16,""" 2 major flight delays""",4,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Bangkok via Tokyo 2 weeks ago. First sign of trouble began when we started circling Narita and crew warned us there would be a delay in landing. This made me nervous as my connecting flight to Bangkok was in 1.5 hours. We circled for nearly an hour before the captain came on the intercom and said we were being redirected to Haneda Airport. No reason given, only apology for inconvenience. We landed and refueled, waited another 1.5 hours and took off again, landing at Narita 45 minutes later. No explanation given, just sorry for inconvenience. I ran into the airport, hoping that my connecting flight had waited for me, but it was to no avail. My connecting flight had already left. I had to wait in another line for 2.5 hours to get booked on the first morning flight to BKK, and JAL put me up in a Narita Hotel. I found out that the delay was caused because an earlier aircraft had run off the runway, causing the airport delay. Anyway, bad enough, get on with life. A week later I show up at the airport in Bangkok, and JAL ticket counter informs me my flight has been delayed by 3 hours. Oh hell, not again! Which of course means I cannot catch my connecting flight in Narita again. I ask the reason for the delay, they tell me it's maintenance issue. Wait for over an hour, and to JAL's credit they do book me a flight on EVA air in business class. Thumbs up for that. But to have 2 major flight delays by the same airline on same itinerary is pretty sad.

So the plane was late leaving and late arriving in Taiwan. The food was so so, for business class, really it could have been better. Gate staff also were not well organized. It is surprising for Japan. The lack of signs at the airport gate area and the size of the gate area were terrible. Passengers did not know which lines to go to and business and first class passengers also had to fight through the crowd to board. The biggest problem with the flight was a screaming infant across the isle. Flight attendants did nothing. The parents and grandparents also did nothing. It was horrifying. People should not be traveling with infants, period, for any reason unless they are moving abroad! These were typical selfish parents who insist to travel with their family and could careless about other people. The flight was full and their kid was crying the whole time. Which means their kid was not comfortable. This selfishness has to stop, and airline staff and airlines need to address it instead of ignoring it. I paid good money for a business class seat, and yet I had to endure this nonsense the entire flight.

The seats are comfortable, the always smiling FAs were charming and the IFE extensive enough to while away the flight. Narita is not my preferred airport out of Tokyo because of the long taxi to the runway. But the captain made up most of the delay. For an economy ticket I felt the most impressive aspect of the flight was the excellent F&B service. Indeed I would almost go as far as to call it superb. An extensive drinks offering was followed by one of the few delicious meals I have ever enjoyed in economy class. JAL has a policy of inviting six young chefs develop new and different recipes for economy passengers. My main course of braised beef in red wine sauce with penne pasta and a dash of cheese was quite excellent, the pasta being perfectly al dente. A salad and two different vegetable dishes were complemented by an almond jelly that must have had some additional ingredient for it, too, had excellent consistency and flavour.

Hate the Boeing 787 electronic window blinds because they do not get completely dark - on a flight heading west, they do not stop the sun shining into the cabin and heating it up. IFE was OK but not outstanding. Although the crew were great, the food (Japanese set ) was not fresh. The drink service was slow as well which for a flight that is not too long delayed food service and resulted in little time for sleep.

Midnight departure so snack bag and water given less than 10 mins after seat belt sign off letting everyone get to sleep. Minimal announcements and big breakfast served 2.5 hours before arrival. Leg room great, toilets always clean, staff very attentive. The Improvements: Seat base is thin and while leg room great I found the seat thin and uncomfortable, Toilets, 3 shared amongst 150 economy and Premium economy pax, so while clean there was always a line. Movie range was a bit limited, great system but minimal new movies. Overall still a great way to get to Japan from Melbourne, leave at midnight and arrive at 9am, no time lost.

They offer their premium passengers access to Lufthansa's Senator Lounge instead. Boarding was quite nice and in order, something that I have not seen in Terminal One for a long time. The F Sky Suite was nicely designed and spacious, with ample storage space. Meals were good and nicely presented, as expected from a leading F product. Staff are respectful and accommodating. I picked the Japanese menu but also expressed that I liked caviar, which belonged to the Western menu, and the attendant happily obliged. She also offered to make my bed in the suite across the aisle (the cabin was only half full) so I can continue to use my suite for lounging and the other for sleeping. Such small initiatives made a difference between good and excellent service. It should be noted that, unlike many other first class suites, the Sky Suite does not have a personal closet to hang your clothes.

2019-05-28,"""such a disappointment""",2,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Ho Chi Minh City via Tokyo. I was very frustrated of how JAL treats its customer in my latest flight. My flight was through 02 transits each for the arrival and return trip, and most of the flights which were run in cooperation between JAL and American Airlines had at least 30 min delay but I was fine about that. However, in my second flight upon return after the first transit, JAL was late for 1 hour and 20 mins due to maintenance issue, whilst my connecting flight (the final one to return home) is only 1 hour from the previous flight's arrival time. When we got to NRT, the connecting flight has not yet departed, and was still boarding, but instead of guiding us to the gate so that we can be on board quickly (which may take approx. 10 mins), they threw us to another airline, with an additional transit (KL) and additional 10 hours flight and waiting at the KL airport. What is even more frustrating is the JAL staff who gave us the new ticket, she said in the first place when we just arrived, running and confused: JAL arranged another flight by which we can get home at midnight on the same day ?. Only when we recheck our tickets it appears that we have to wait 5 hours at KL and arrive at 10:00AM the next day. (The group that were left from the final flight was about 6 people). When we asked about our luggage, she said that our luggage is already transferred to the final destination and we don't have to worry about them  - should we not worry if the luggage arrive before us? Later, I checked with another girl at the counter, she said that our luggage are coming with us on this flight, and it is the airlines rule that the luggage must fly together with the passenger. Everything happened today was such a disappointment and created a bad impression to me about JAL. We waited for them to be late for 01 hr and 20 min, whilst they cannot wait for us just a few minutes so we can get to the gate and come home after 14 flight hours, just to be on time on THAT flight, as if they are very punctual and never delay..

The flight attendants were incredible, always walking by to see if we needed anything and the bathroom was clean. I don't know why there was such a big difference in the flights.

2019-06-13,"""requested a full refund""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seattle to Tokyo . We purchased an air ticket for my wife to travel to visit family in Tokyo, Japan, on JAL. The ticket was purchased via GoToGate travel - purchased on 4/3/2019 for travel beginning on 6/25/2019 at a cost of approximately $1200. Unfortunately, after booking and upon inspection of her travel document, she discovered a typographical error in her first name. On the ticket, her first name (four letters) has an extra letter (ii instead of i) rather than the correct spelling. We're not sure how this happened, and were quite surprised to see it. We made repeated attempts to rectify this situation and get the typo corrected. We contacted GoToGate by phone and email multiple times. We contacted JAL by phone and email multiple times. We drove to the airport in San Diego and asked for help at the JAL desk. We contacted Alaska Air. Though our efforts did receive some replies, none were satisfactory. The typo remains on the ticket. Given the fact that TSA or the Airline may stop her at Airport Security Screening, or stop her from boarding the flight, she is not willing to use the ticket. Therefore, we have requested a full refund for the amount of the ticket, minus an appropriate handling fee, so that her booking via Go To Gate on Alaska and JAL will available, and so that some other passenger may book travel on the seat. We believe that the airline and the travel agency have a moral obligation and responsibility to serve customers to the best of their abilities, and to rectify this kind of situation. Moreover, both the airline, the travel agency, and other customers stand to benefit by allowing the seat to be used by another customer. We are aware of the airline policies and practices regarding refunds and changes, yet we believe certain situations are exceptional and require flexibility.

Food is a difficult topic as some may not like Japanese food and be more satisfied with a nice piece of meat. But in terms of Japanese Cuisine, what JAL offers in business class is excellent. Rare food such as Awabi (Abalone) was even offered. I never took the western menu so I cannot comment on that. The Skysuite product is wonderful, especially on the window side. Thinking this product was introduced in 2013, it is still among the best seat on the market. Window seat offers complete privacy. All seats offer a fully flat bed which does not become narrow at your feet, and a very comfortable mattress and pillow. ANA is just catching up this year with their new product. I prefer this setup compared to the widely used reverse herringbone layout. Plane: The Boeing 787 is a great plane, although I prefer the A350 (the A350 is I think quieter).

The flight from Boston to Tokyo was on a B787-9, and the flight from Tokyo to Manila was on a B787-8. The flight from Boston to Tokyo was scheduled to depart in the middle of a blizzard. Unfortunately, this created some problems regarding preparing the aircraft. We eventually boarded (very quickly, as is Japan Airlines' custom). We then had to wait for a while as our plane was de-iced. We ended up leaving Boston about two hours late. However, the pilots were able to make up for one of those hours in the air, so that we only arrived about one hour late in Tokyo. Another passenger was concerned about making his connecting flight in Tokyo. A flight attendant calmly explained that he would have enough time and that they would hold the flight for him if necessary. This turned out to be unnecessary, as, to my shock, the staff at Narita basically just allowed all arriving passengers with connecting international flights to go directly into the gate area without first clearing security. This was truly a godsend and ensured that people really did make their connecting flights. And since gates weren't supposed to close until just 10 minutes before departure, this meant they did not even have to hold planes for people! As for the inflight experience, it was similar to my experiences from Manila to Boston, except that there was no last-minute snack service just before arriving in Tokyo. Instead, they offered us sweet buns midway through the flight. Again, we were served a full meal on the flight from Boston to Tokyo and on the flight from Tokyo to Manila, as well as a light meal towards the end of the flight from Boston to Tokyo. And once again, with the exception of the full meal from Boston to Tokyo, there were no choices for the meals-there was only one option. However, as usual, all of the food was truly superb. Because I was flying during a different month from my previous flights with Japan Airlines, I noticed they removed from their entertainment system a movie I had begun watching previously and had hoped to finish watching during this trip. That was disappointing. There were toothbrushes and toothpaste available in the lavatories during the flight from Boston to Tokyo, but not until relatively late in the flight.

Upon arrival at check-in, though, a lady at the business class check-in desk checked me in and assured me that I would make my flight. Indeed, because Japan Airlines boarded the aircraft beginning only 30 minutes before departure and did not close the gate until 10 minutes before departure, things went just fine. I know that many airlines would not be so forgiving of a late arrival. Many airlines also would probably have lost my luggage when I checked it in so late. Not Japan Airlines! It made it all the way to Boston. As for the inflight experience, the flight attendants were polite, friendly, and accommodating. I was seated in a bulkhead seat for the first time in many years, and one of the flight attendants helped me to open up the TV monitor for that seat. The seats were very comfortable. Blankets and pillows were available on both flights. Toothbrushes and toothpaste were available in the lavatories during the flight from Tokyo to Boston. Too bad that there were no amenity kits, but it's always the toothbrushes and toothpaste that I most desire during such flights, so they just barely met my expectations there. Perhaps the least impressive part of the experience was the inflight entertainment. While I appreciated that they offered manga for people to read if they so desired, the selection of movies and TV seemed somewhat lackluster, and it was disappointing that many items were not available with English subtitles. Finally, there was the food. I was served one full meal on the flight from Manila to Tokyo and one full meal and a sort of ""light meal"" on the flight from Tokyo to Boston. We were also served packaged snacks about 35 minutes prior to landing in Boston, which seemed kind of last-minute to me and a little awkward. The full meals were truly enormous-by far the largest meals I have ever had on a flight. The one served from Manila to Tokyo was perhaps the largest of all. The entree was a sort of chicken in a creamy mushroom sauce, served with sliced carrots, sliced zucchini, and fried rice with egg and vegetables. It also came with a vegetable salad with dressing, a fruit salad, a noodle salad, a potato salad with ham and cheese, miso soup, Haagen-Daaz vanilla ice cream, a chocolate chip cookie, a bottle of water, and your choice of beverage. I found it particularly stunning that Japan Airlines has their own kiwi-apple juice blend which they call ""Sky Time Kiwi."" Wow! All of the foods I was served were delicious. One criticism I can make of the food is that with the exception of the full meal from Tokyo to Boston, there was no choice for the meal options. That is, you got what you were served. Overall, though, it was a truly Japanese experience, and it was truly excellent. I would gladly fly with them again in the future if they offer tickets at competitive prices like they did this time.",Economy Class,1,yes,338,1,1,1,1,Boeing 787-8 and Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Manila to Boston via Narita,November 2019,1,,Japan Airlines,Japan

Japan Airlines is the only airline worldwide offering a 2-4-2 config for B787. The pitch and legroom were way beyond satisfactory.

They gave us no information, flew us to a different airport than we started in, refused to get us a hotel, and it took 12 hours for the flight to leave again, and we weren't allowed to leave the gate because it was too complicated. They refused compensation or tell us how to file a complaint. Service was horrible, little to no information, and they were still two hours late taking off on the recovery flight with us stuck in our seats on the tarmac that whole time, then it took nearly two hours to get our baggage in Vancouver.

2020-02-03,"""putting me on a Finnair flight""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a premium economy ticket with Japan Airlines from Paris to Sydney. My flight leaving Paris with Finnair was delayed. There was only an hour between connecting flights so I missed my connecting flight from Helsinki to Tokyo. Upon arriving in Helsinki I was met by someone from Finnair who said they were putting me on a Finnair flight. I asked them what what class I was being put in as my ticket was premium economy and I knew Finnair didn't offer premium economy. They told me it was economy and that there was nothing they could do. I queried this with several people before I boarded the plane which didn't seem to go down well with anybody. I was told I was holding the plane up, to get on the plane and to contact customer service when I landed. I did get on the plane and endured 9 hours of a cramped seat. I contacted Japan Airlines when I got back to complain about this and to ask for a refund for this part of my flight. Japan Airlines have told me it is not their problem and I have to contact Finnair. I asked several questions in my letter - who decided I was being put on a Finnair flight, was Japan Airlines given the option of waiting for my flight, why wasn't I asked if I wanted to fly the next day on a Japan Airlines flight. None of these questions have been answered. I am slightly confused why I would be writing to an airline that I have not paid for a ticket to ask for a refund - ie Finnair. My tickets were booked through Japan Airlines so surely it is their responsibility to deal with issues/complaints from their tickets holders. I have written to Japan Airlines three times and got the same response each time, with one response finishing with ""I do hope you will fly Japan Airlines again"". My flight from Sydney to Paris which was actually with Japan Airlines went without a fault. They have a fantastic premium economy product. Plenty of space and legroom. Even though the food served is the same as in economy it was some of the best airline food I have tasted and the service was fantastic too. I actually thought I had found a really good value for money alternative to business class. I am aware things can go wrong and sometimes missing connecting flights is out of anyone's control.

2020-09-24,"""one of the truly best airlines in the world""",7,"✅ Trip Verified |  Found a great deal and flew with JAL when I traveled from southeast Texas to Singapore. JAL staff in Seattle weren't particularly friendly, but JAL staff at Narita were quite pleasant and helpful in my brief interactions with them. The quality of the meal and drinks were quite satisfactory for economy class. They had a decent selection of entertainment from around the world, including some Japanese movies that I ended up watching with English subtitles. The plane and lavatories were clean; the on-flight personnel, the utmost in being pleasant and professional. One flight attendant in particular, Cindy from Singapore, chatted with me about Singapore for a minute and wished me safe and enjoyable travels to that city. Something else: I got up and went to the toilet, and came back only to find my neck pillow missing (I'm convinced that some passenger stole it. Who does that, steal a nondescript black neck pillow?!) At any rate, I disembarked the plane after landing at Narita; right before walking out of the jetway, I still wanted to try to at least make one more effort to find that neck pillow. I explained to the flight staff that I was looking for a pillow, and it had gone missing. 5-6 flight attendants sprung into action, with me, to look for that pillow. While it was never found, I made sure to smile and say ""Thank you!"" I have a hard time imagining that that level of service would ever occur on a North American airline. The only reason that I've reduced JAL's rating from 9 to 7, is because trying to call, email or contact them otherwise through my online JAL account about changing flights is absolutely like pulling teeth (this has been a problem for a different trip than this one).

On arrival at the checking counter at Narita airport, JAL staff asked me for my documents and my PCR test results, to what I replied, that they were not needed to get to Spain. They didn't know about the Spanish conditions and were confused from the beginning. After discussing among the team, and calling different people on the phone, they informed me that they were requiring the PCR in order to fly, because they knew of someone that got rejected to transfer in Paris without PCR. They proceeded to suggest that i changed my route to go through Helsinki and London, when I had to inform them myself, that the route was not possible since the UK was for sure requiring a PCR in order to transfer at their airports. I showed the manager the official French government and airport sites explaining that PCR was not needed for someone transferring in CDG, showed that Air France was not requiring PCR for me to fly to Spain. All these took approximately 4 hours, and the only response I got was that JAL was following indications by the Japanese embassy in France, and that on their site, they suggested that everyone had a PCR in order to transfer in France. I was offered to change my flight for the following day, under the condition of getting a PCR test. I did get my PCR test and returned to the airport the following day. Hoping that with some time, they would have had time and the decency to at least check and apologize for the mistake.

Typically, flying economy from New York to Japan is a nightmare at around $900. This was not the case for Japan Airlines–let me count the bidets. They gave us ice cream. They asked me–nearly constantly–if I'd like something else to eat or drink. I had an entire row to myself–as did nearly everyone else on the plane. I slept, I worked. I have to say that–like everything else I know about Japan (very little) the plane exhibited a kind of antiquated futurism. Unlike most modern airplanes, it didn't have a plug for my laptop or really any movies I wanted to see. But that just meant I ended up not having to do too much work and I got to see the ending of Kenneth Branagh's Orient Express. Also, the bathroom lavatory has a heated toilet seat.

I flew Japan airlines from India to the United States with a layover in Narita. The staff was very friendly and patient. Not sure where everything broke down but both my seat and vegetarian meal requests were ignored.  The issues began with online check-in: checked into my flight online and was told to pick up my boarding pass at the airport. 8 weeks prior I requested a vegetarian meal and window seat for both legs of my flight when I was booking. During check-in, I made sure to request a vegetarian meal again which did not make it onto my boarding pass. I noticed during check in that I was assigned an aisle and middle seat for the two legs (I’d booked a window seat). Tried to request a seat change at the gate at both airports but was (very nicely at Narita I want to stress) told “the flight is full and there’s nothing we can do”. And at both airports when I requested the vegetarian meal, again “there’s nothing we can do, they’ve already loaded the food onto the flight”.

Easy, points used, flights booked all good… Until we arrived at JFK airport. 3 days earlier we had tried to catch the flight but due to Covid regulations we needed a PCR test, so the flight was postponed. We then paid the additional charge to Qantas. Japan Airlines then informed us on our arrival via their supervisor our tickets were fake and we were not confirmed on the flight. Earlier that morning we had double checked with Qantas. We showed our receipt of payment, answer no. I called Qantas customer service and they tell them to look at their screen. JAL Manager says its fake and walks away. At this point the manager is trying to avoid me, I say please speak to Qantas here is the phone.

2022-10-24,"""Food out of Japan is good""",5,"Not Verified |  New business class Suite III is inferior to the Suite II - the area where your feet / legs go tapers off. So if you are a tall person you are going to struggle to bend to the space. When the seat is not in full decline there is no support under your legs - from the seat to the feet area. This means you are going to be constantly trying to find a comfortable position if working / eating or not in full decline. - when you are partially reclined and have the table down it is quite small. The Suite II seat was superior (especially the window seat) on privacy and just in regards to the actual seat. No issues with the recline position/support or table. The flight attendants aren't trained to look at the list of who is a frequent flyer with their own airline. I am a Diamond flyer (the top frequent flyer status) and still watch in amusement that my Japanese wife gets a 'thank you for joining us again today. Thank you for on-going support'. In the meantime, me, a non-Japanese person, get no acknowledgement at all! (I have only been acknowledged about my status less than five times in all). This time - I got... 'You want the Japanese menu of course - that is why you chose to fly with a Japanese airline right? Is it your first time to Japan?' Ask your cabin crew to check the passenger list of non-Japanese travellers. If they are a JAL frequent flyer - then acknowledge them like you do with the Japanese. On arrival into Japan my flight was late (due to the flight arriving in Sydney late) due to the aircraft having trouble in Japan. I was not assisted to get to the next flight to Osaka even though the later flight had over an hour to go until departure I got that flight is already boarded - a domestic flight boarding an hour before departure? Instead, I was put on the Kansai Osaka flight and arrived at 2am in the morning instead of 8.30pm. Ground crew didn't even try and didn't have a 'can do - let's fix our mistake attitude'. Food out of Japan is good. Out of Sydney, it is not good! The quality is lacking. I recommend the western dish out of Sydney and then the Japanese dish out of Japan. Inflight entertainment  is an old system and the choice is OK for a couple of flights. You will struggle to find choice if going on more than a couple of flights a month.  The technology on the handset is very 2000s. The screen in business and economy are good. WIFI drops in and out - but it is normal on all airlines. Good enough to work and get things done.

Cabin: The seats were spacious but the flight was so so so warm I started sweating 10 minutes into the flight. It felt very stuffy. Entertainment: They had very limited choices of movies. Fluency: For some reason they did so many announcements, especially about their food. This kept interrupting the entertainment system.
