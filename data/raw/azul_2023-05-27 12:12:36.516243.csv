2009-04-13,Azul Airlines customer review,9,Flew roundtrip from VCP to REC in Brazil. Easy check-in both ways. Helpful ground staff. Aircraft was a new Embraer 195 with nice light-colored interior fittings. Friendly casual crew. Usual budget airline snacks and beverages. No in-flight entertainment. Departed and arrived on time both flights. As good a flight experience as possible on a domestic budget airline.,Economy Class,1,yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2009-05-28,Azul Airlines customer review,9,Sao Paulo-Campinas to Salvador and back. Easy to use web site made booking process fast. Price was 50% less than the fare out of other Sao Paulo airports. Nice clean airport with fast efficient check in. Brand new airplane with individual seat entertainment (only in Portuguese). Onboard service simple: drinks and a selection of snacks but the crew were enthusiastic and pleasant.,Economy Class,1,yes,2,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2010-02-11,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Have flown multiple times between Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre Brazil. Excellent service friendly staff and comfortable and new planes. Website easy to use with great pricing and promotions. Also pet friendly - small pets can fly in the cabin! Best part if they fly from Rio's Santos Dumont airport - much closer and easier access than Rio's Tom Jobin Airport (GIG).,Economy Class,1,yes,3,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2011-01-25,Azul Airlines customer review,9,VCP-CWB. FA's friendly new airplanes and nice 2x2 configuration. Great price/value. The food was ok - its a low cost airline. On 30 minute flight offered 4 options of snack. Soft drinks handed in 350ml cans and the plastic cups. Onboard entertainment was zero.,Economy Class,1,yes,5,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2011-03-19,Azul Airlines customer review,8,Generally speaking they offer excellent service for flights within Brazil and are a great alternative to TAM. Flights normally on time there's a good choice of free snacks and soft drinks and if you book in advance they're good value. Their hub at VCP is very convenient if you live outside of Sao Paulo city although it's now quite crowded and specially very difficult to park.,Economy Class,1,yes,6,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2011-03-21,Azul Airlines customer review,10,VCP-SDU return. Both flights on time check easy website easy to use nice new plane with lively interior.

2011-05-21,Azul Airlines customer review,9,SDU-VCP on Embraer 190. Azul has brought to Brazilian market some items other domestic airlines had long forg0tten: good seats reasonable legroom individual IFE (satellite TV) and courteous and efficient service. New fleet of Embraer E-Jets is a plus.,Economy Class,1,yes,9,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2011-06-05,Azul Airlines customer review,8,Azul has become my first choice on Brazilian domestic flights. New Embraer ERJ 170 and ERJ 190 with personal entertainment in most of them. The leather seats are very comfortable and with good space. Just after the take-off free soft drinks and snacks are available. The crew are outstanding.,Economy Class,1,yes,10,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2011-07-06,Azul Airlines customer review,9,VCP-JPA return. The usual thing with Azul: great flight great aircraft excellent crew good IFE (not as good as international carriers but much better than other airlines flying domestic routes in Brasil). For only R$20 (about USD12.5) got an upgrade to Premium Economy and it made a great difference since it's an evening 3 hrs flight. Also the buses linking VCP (about 100km from Sao Paulo) to downtown are great and the ride probably takes less time than a taxi to GRU. Only thing that needs to improve are the snacks a sandwich (even a cold one) would fit better for long routes like this one.,Economy Class,1,yes,11,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-03-15,Azul Airlines customer review,9,SJP-VCP on ATR72. Web check-in customer friendly including seat choice. Boarding well organised and well conducted by friendly ground staff. Plane was brand new and seat pitch ok however seats are very thin and narrow. Cabin service adequate for the journey with water juices and 4 different snacks. Cabin crew were charming and flight deck informative. Here we have a case of low cost but high quality.,Economy Class,1,yes,12,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-06-04,Azul Airlines customer review,9,VCP-SJP. Although its a LCC its no nonsense approach makes it a good choice. No hidden fees no charges for beverages snacks and luggage. Check-in was fast and easy. Boarding was hassle free although VCP has no bridges and it took 10 minutes by bus to arrive at the remote position of the brand new ATR 72-600. Plane was clean and cabin crew welcoming and very courteous. Doors were closed at 18.50 and plane took off at 19.10 slightly behind schedule. Captain made announcements before take-off and came back before landing with more information. Arrival was on time. I certainly recommend Azul.,Economy Class,1,yes,13,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-06-24,Azul Airlines customer review,10,SDU-POA-SDU. Flights on time free snacks and beverages courteous and attentive cabin crew comfortable leather seats. No complaints at all would definitely fly AZUL again.,Economy Class,1,yes,14,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-08-22,Azul Airlines customer review,2,"Porte Alegre - Fortaleza (through Campinas): all flights cancelled in Porte Alegre due to fog in Campinas: that can happen but Azul had no idea how to organize this. They first had us wait 4 hours saying we would be on the next plane but a lie: no planes coming-in/going-out. They had no idea when we could fly and they just sent us away: ""maybe in 2 or 3 days try tomorrow"". Their hub in Campinas is total chaos. Only good thing is their planes are nice 2-2 seaters but that does not compensate their chaos. Don't be fooled by their cheaper rates: is not worth the delays and other mess.",Economy Class,1,no,15,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2012-11-14,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Ribeirao Preto to Belo Horizonte (Confins). I flew with them earlier today and was extremely impressed. I arrived at the small airport (RAO) early and got to watch 3 flights leave before mine. My flight pushed off on schedule. The flight was one of their new turboprops but it was very smooth and quiet even compared to most jet flights I have taken. Arrived 15 minutes early. Plenty of legroom. Drinks and snacks distributed promptly and efficiently. Staff very friendly. Check-in was extremely fast. Flight had no IFE but I'm pretty sure all their longer flights do (RAO-CNF is only 80 mins). One quick note. If you don't have a credit card issued in Brazil online booking or telephone booking probably not an option. Depending on your situation either swing by the airport to pay in person or book through a travel agency.,Economy Class,1,yes,16,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2013-02-07,Azul Airlines customer review,9,CNF-GRU on a E-195 pretty good quick flight and came with a simple snack very expensive due to holiday dates I also had an extra space seat which was pretty comfortable didn't want it but it was the only seat left available.,Economy Class,1,yes,17,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2013-03-08,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Round trip from Porto Alegre (POA) to Curitiba (CWB). Surprised with the high quality of services offered knowing it is a low-cost carrier. I spent R$240 (US$120) for the trip including all taxes. Check-in was very fast less than 5 minutes the plane was always on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier than scheduled (on both legs). The plane an Embraer E195 (in both legs) was pretty quiet and Azul offered TV in real time with a lot of channels. Very clean and I liked the scheme 2-2 seats. Snacks (4 options) and drinks (5 options) offered FA's were polite and friendly. I will certainly fly Azul again.,Economy Class,1,yes,19,,,,,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2013-03-19,Azul Airlines customer review,10,AD 4313/4002 SJP-VCP-SDU. Brand new AT7 on SJP-VCP sector and E90 on the VCP SDU sector that included live TV adequate legroom and seat width free snacks served by smiling welcoming crews. Both flights left and arrived on time not even 15 minutes delays unusual by most standards anywhere.

2013-05-06,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Flew VCP-GIG-VCP and VCP-IGU-VCP. Very nice check-in staff. They even located an agent that spoke English to assist me with my flight. All segments left timely or early. All planes were well maintained. Flight attendants were friendly and professional. Unlimited snacks and drinks offered. Baggage delivered very fast. My only other comment is that all in-flight announcements were in Portuguese. However I found most flight attendants did speak some English and were eager to assist. US airlines could learn from Azul on how to provide good and friendly customer service!,Economy Class,1,yes,21,1,1,1,N/A,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2013-12-03,Azul Airlines customer review,9,I used Azul airlines for a round trip from Sao Paolo to Rio de Janeiro. Due to the fact I booked one day before the flight I guess a paid a little bit more than usual: ca. 550 for 2 people with 23kg luggage each. The aircraft was well equipped - TV screen for every seat where you could choose several tv channels (only some in English) and quite a lot of space for the legs for a small aircraft. The staff were friendly. They only serve a drink and a snack (cookies or nuts) on the flight but it was only a 1hr flight. Our flight was a little bit delayed but that is quite normal (esp in Brazil). I'd like to make an additional service about their customer service: we had to change our flight back on the day of the flight to not miss our flight after and their service was brilliant! They booked us on another earlier flight and didn't charge us for that change! This is really customer friendly.,Economy Class,N/A,yes,25,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2014-07-06,Azul Airlines customer review,10,Belo Horizonte (CND) to Montes Claros (MOC) on flight AD5028 Embraer 195. My travel begins with a fast reservation on website. Easy and objective. The onboard service is another differential of Azul. When boarding you are always welcomed with a big smile from the flights attendants. The ATR-72 have no entertainment onboard because usually the route is regional and it is fast but onboard the EMB-195 you can enjoy excellent individual entertainment. The comfortable is another differential of Azul. All aircraft's have just double seats.,Economy Class,N/A,yes,28,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil
2015-02-11,Azul Airlines customer review,8,Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo. Brand new Embraer 195 with personal screens on every seat and live TV with a broad selection of movies sports channels and news. Cabin crew is friendly and well-groomed. Flight time was 55 minutes. Snacks (cookies chips and pretzels) along with water juices and spirits were distributed free of charge. Announcements and safety information/instructions were held in Portuguese only: in my opinion they should be in English too. Overall a nice experience. Ticket fare was very low considering the peak season (beginning of February). I usually fly TAM for domestic flights within Brazil but as of now I will consider Azul as a valid alternative option.,Economy Class,N/A,yes,29,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,Azul,Brazil

2015-10-05,"""had to pay for the flight twice""",3,"We travel in Brazil and internationally quite a bit sometimes from within Brazil and sometimes from abroad. If you plan to use a non-Brasilian credit or debit card in Brasil, the golden rule is make sure it is 'unlocked' for use in Brasil for the period in use or they may likely decline it for security reasons (we use both, but our business card is a UK one). But what if you don't notice that it is going through Brasilian verification? Online it usually makes no difference: this time it did. I booked a flight with Azul, which I've done many times. The booking went through but they said there was a small problem on the card which was not unlocked. I phoned Mastercard and made sure it was unlocked. The Azul confirmation came through again, saying the payment and flight was confirmed. Mastercard also said that that specific payment had been confirmed when I spoke to them. The next day, an email arrived from Azul saying there is a problem. I spend an hour on the phone with them but the upshot is that they said they had refunded the amount (this later turned out to be untrue) because of the initial problem. They asked me to send email photographs of the front of my credit card and passport (which in itself breaks Internet security protocols and their agreements with Mastercard). They assured me that was the only way to sort it out and it would all be confirmed and sorted out in thirty minutes so reluctantly I sent them. Two hours and more long distance phone calls later, the person who had made the promise had gone home and the new person said the flight would have to be paid for again and not with that card (there is nothing wrong with the card). Now I know the airline gurus on here will say, Oh it's all your fault, you should have done such-and-such, but the mistakes or problems I encountered (as someone who books many flights) could happen to anyone, which is why I am sharing the story. So when the offices open again I phone Mastercard again. They tell that the payment was definitely approved (and supplied the authorisation code) and that the transaction had definitely gone through (and provided me with the transaction code) and that it definitely had not been refunded. I asked if there was a refund pending and they said there was not any refund pending. When confronted with this, they (Azul) changed their story and said it hadn't been refunded but it would be refunded once the payment was made in person at their office. This required my partner to take several hours off, take a taxi from Sao Paulo to Barueri (where the Azul office is situated, a journey of about 25km with tolls and heavy traffic that can take over an hour) and pay cash for something that they, Azul, had already received cash for and still had cash for. (Presumably if we had accepted them at their word, that the money had been refunded, and just changed to a flight with TAM, bearing in mind this is two days before travel, they would not have refunded it at all.) The other 'option' they offered was for my partner to take the money to the airport and pay for the flight and that they would refund the money to the credit card after she had done so. (The first option meant lost time and expense, the second one arriving at the airport without a guaranteed flight carrying more money than is desirable when travelling around.) We decided we had few choices but to pay for the flight twice in the hope that the money will eventually be refunded and an e-ticket issued.",Economy Class,1,no,33,1,1,,,,Business,Sao Paulo to Sao Luis,October 2015,1,1,Azul,Brazil

On board the FA's were very professional and attentive. There were drinks and a wide range of snacks offered on all flights. The seats were comfortable and all flights left and arrived on time. The only complaint I have is that all announcements including the safety brief were in Portuguese only.

In general, the onboard service was average to good throughout. My problem was with the check-in staff at Belo Horizonte who did not speak English and were not well oriented to international ticketing and baggage handling. Furthermore, the transfer from the domestic terminal to the international terminal at Sao Paulo Viracopos was particularly unorganized, leaving the passenger to figure out how to get from point a to point b. Surprisingly, even at Viracopos finding assistance from English speaking airline staff was a challenge.

2016-03-02,"""really care about customers""",9,"I read reviews stating that Azul was better, however, when checking discount sites, GOL was on average $200 less, and thus is what we went for on our first 2 flights. Our third and 4th flight, was going to be Azul. Azul was by far, way more friendly and customer service oriented than GOL. Unfortunately, as we had booked our tickets on a discount site, we were not easily able to get our tickets changed to an earlier flight - but when we got to the airport 3 hours earlier than planned in Cuiaba, the check in clerk let a translator know that there were seats open on a flight that would get us into Iguacu at midnight instead of 6am. Unfortunately because of the discount site, we did not qualify to do so. But the fact that a company would go out of its way to do this for us is awesome in my opinion. It shows that as a company, they really care about their customers! The only downside (which was shared with GOL) that you should be aware of, is that if you have a connecting flight of more than 4 hours you will need to pick up your luggage and re-check it in. Mind you, the first time we experienced this was with GOL and they had not warned us that this was going to happen. When we were checking in with Azul, they told us that when we reached our 2nd connection as we were going to be there for 6 hours, we would need to pick up our luggage and then check it back in 2hrs before our flight. Another great thing is that (at least at this point in time) most of their staff seemed to know English, which is very very helpful for travelers that aren't from Portugal or Brazil. I am not sure of what other languages they may or may not know. But it was very comforting actually being able to understand somebody. The last thing, and I am not sure whether this is supposed to be standard practice, or if we just got lucky on 5 flights, is that they had a wide selection of snacks on-board. and you didnt have to pick just one. If you wanted one of each of the 5 selections, they would make sure that you got one of each.",Economy Class,1,yes,40,1,1,1,1,,Solo Leisure,CGB to IGU,February 2016,1,,Azul,Brazil

Once I told them I had a connection they promptly put me in another fly with another company (Gol). That another company flight also delay because of intense traffic (no company fault). We arrive in San Paulo, but was already late and we lost our connection. We talk with Azul and explained the situation. Without any need for discuss, they promptly bring us to a hotel, everything paid. Then they gave us a letter witch we showed to Etihad so they put us on a flight on the next day. Azul were very nice and helpful. I will definitely fly again because I know that if I need they are going to be helpful.

2017-02-13,"""it really surprised me""",10,"✅ Verified Review |  I always fly with Azul Airlines here in Brazil, but I decided to write about this specific flight due to the special circumstances. I was flying from Campinas to Floranópolis and when arriving at the destination, we were informed that there was a storm over Florianópolis. After spending some time over the surroundings expecting for a window to land, the pilot decided to abort the landing and continue to it's final destination which was Porto Alegre. Due to the impossibility to land in Florianópolis, and since it was night, Azul booked hotel rooms to the passengers, organized the transport, included meals and booked a return flight 6 am in the morning.

Online booking magically booked a connecting flight departing earlier than my flight arrival. Luckly I managed to get it corrected before the fight date. Domestic leg from Rio de Janeiro SDU to Viracopos/Campinas was confortable with average service. Bagagge check was ok, no priority tags for business class with bags dispatched all the way to Lisbon. Onboard baggage allowance of one item up to 5 kilos was ridiculous. Boarding in Viracopos was confusing due to deficient signage. Business class full flat seats were very confortable, pillows were clean and smelled good. Meal service was average, no seconds offered even on water. Coffee only if requested but flight atendants vanished right after service was somewhat considered complete. More like economy business than full business. In flight entertainment was ok but could do with noise suppressing phones.  One checked suitcase did not arrive. Azul customer service was useless. Even after it arrived later on a TAP flight from Salvador, we were told in writing it was not their problem and that we should have a solution in the next 5 days.

On return we noticed only 3 international flights for the whole day. It makes no economic sense to use this airport as your hub. We were very pleased with economy flights, 40 euro each way and served a snack. Our issue is the lack of service on the 10 hour business class flights. The seat and design is good and matches all the products out there. It's the service, you get served a meal and then stewards disappear for the rest of the flight until breakfast a little over an hour before landing. This was a daytime flight crossing only two time zones. I shouldn't have to ask for a drink. I believe this policy needs to change. Also the meal itself was presented well but tasted like an economy meal and was lukewarm. It's presented all together so you have to eat starter quickly before your main goes cold.

Sao Paulo to Lisbon. Received an email a few days before the flight informing me the flight would be 2 hours early. No problem. Went to check in , I got passed from pillar to post, nobody spoke English, nobody wanted responsibility. Eventually someone who had to speak to me said ”didn’t you receive the mail?” Why insult your passengers with complete lies, it was never sent. Basically the flight was delayed by 5 hours. Generously, they had re-scheduled my connection in Lisboa. The lounge at VCP is quite basic, very little choice on either food or drink, so being stuck in it for 7 hours was quite depressing. Luckily the net worked very well. Eventually I got on the plane. The food served in business class was very poor for an international flight. Beef in sauce, rice, potato sticks. I have a Brasilian wife, I know what the local food is like, this was poor. Then the selection of “fine” cheeses for dessert. What an insult. No taste, all soft cheeses, biscuits still in the wrapper. Then the bed - very thin and old padding, you could feel everything underneath you, being 1.87M tall I could not stretch and slept in a curl. Unfortunately there is a hard circular rim at the bottom of the foot well. Very uncomfortable. The FA’s service was very good during dinner, non existent at breakfast. I was not offered a cup of tea. Very poor for business. I have to be honest, I have my doubts over Azul’s viability in the international long haul market.

We were only told that the reason the flight was delayed was due to being overweight because we asked an attendant. He explained that they would remove cargo so that we can have our flight. The Azul employees announced where to go for the baggage like normal. When we arrived in Salvador we waited at baggage claim for more than 30 minutes without explanation. Then only because we asked did an Azul employee explain that Azul did not lose baggage but rather decided to leave every single checked bag back in Recife without explanation, warning, or apology. We were then offered the option to sit in the airport for 3 hours to wait for our bags when we are only in Salvador for 2 days. The Azul staff were extremely unhelpful and would not replace medication or other necessities that were immediately needed. We spoke with a manager who did not give any appropriate reasoning for why the airline would choose to prioritize cargo over their own passengers who paid for their seats. She also refused to replace items that were immediately necessary and suggested that it could be more than a day before we get our bags (when again, we are only here for 2 days).

I expected some differences between the experience on the different aircraft but was unprepared for what transpired. The A330-200 was comfortable, if perhaps a bit tired feeling. The A330 Neo felt new but was the worst business class experience in memory. The Neo cabin immediately felt claustrophobic upon entering. It felt as though they jammed in far too many seats in a small area. Then the seats themselves were extraordinarily uncomfortable and equally as claustrophobic. It led to this being a surprisingly poor experience.  When in recline mode, your legs disappear and slide under the IFE screen and other hardware of the shell. From mid thigh downward, you are trapped in a very narrow space which ends at about one foot high and less than one foot wide. It is impossible for your feet to rest without touching anything. It is impossible to roll over on your side and the height of your stacked knees and legs doesn't fit in the space.  Extraordinarily uncomfortable, in fact the most uncomfortable business class seat in memory. Was totally surprised that this happened on Azul, as I would expect much, much better of them. It's clear to me that they rolled out this product without soliciting opinions of actual travelers, and they are responsible for this mess. The crew confirmed I wasn't the first to mention this. I vowed never to do this again, as it was a complete waste of money. The rest of the experience was actually good - professional crews, punctual flights, ok food but for me the seat is by far the only thing that matters and Azul and Airbus are both guilty of jointly delivering a terrible product.

This then required bringing in a supervisor who ultimately agreed with me and said the problem was at their end, where their internal system said one thing, my purchase receipt another. Hard to believe these people would fight me so hard despite their being so wrong. Basically they accused me of trying to steal from them, which couldn't be further from the truth.

My baggage hasn’t arrived. What I can understand, problems happen. What I can’t understand is the way they are treating me. I called the number they gave me, not kidding 34 times from 8 am until 2 pm, nobody answered and when I called Azul they said they outsourced the baggage management and can’t do anything. After 5 days, if the problem is not solved, I should contact them. They may be kidding, they decide to outsource the business and it is my problem. In 5 days, I will be back in the US. It’s incredible how they treat the customer. BTW, there is nothing I can do, only wait.",Economy Class,1,no,84,1,1,,,,Family Leisure,Ft Lauderdale to Viracopos – Campinas,August 2022,1,,Azul,Brazil
2022-09-04,"""flight was comfortable and on time""",8,Not Verified |  Domestic flight from Belo Horizonte to Brasilia on Azul. The flight was comfortable and on time. The service was friendly and offered a snack and a drink. There is nothing more that you can expect on a short domestic flight.,Economy Class,1,yes,85,1,1,1,1,Embraer 195,Business,Belo Horizonte to Brasilia,August 2022,1,,Azul,Brazil
2022-09-13,"""I was charged 328€ for nothing""",1,"Not Verified |  I live in Germany. I have already tried to book flights via Azul airlines various times as I am a frequent traveller to Brazil. Unfortunately my experience with Azul Airlines never went further then trying to book a flight. It's mostly the payment or any other part of the internet service which does not work. Apparently it is not possible for a non Brazilian (or South American) citizen to book a flight -quite frankly I don't know what the problem is, however it is inacceptable. The first few times I tried to master this seemingly impossible task, the booking at least was simply canceled. The last time however, I was charged 328€ for nothing. I nor received an email neither a booking confirmation. ",Economy Class,1,no,86,,,,,,Couple Leisure,,September 2022,,,Azul,Brazil
2022-09-17,"""I’m confused and revolted""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was to travel today, at 8:40pm to Brazil, flight number 8705, for my mom’s funeral, schedule for tomorrow at 4pm. Two man, a little drunk, were on seats in front of me. They were being really loud but also a little funny. A flight attendant, somehow heard them saying the word “bomb”. I was right behind them and didn’t listen anything. I was surprise when I saw the police taking the 2 guys, on a federal crime. I told another flight attendant that it was a mistake. They were drunk and loud but were never a threat. The fight attendant told me to shut up or I was going to be banish from aircraft, with the guys. I was very upset with his behavior and attitude but kept quiet. After all I had to arrive in Brazil asap.  We had to evacuate the plane for the bomb search. When we went back to lobby, I saw officers everywhere. I spoke with one of them and told my version of the facts! I was just scare that those 2 poor drunk guys could get in big federal problem, due to a misunderstanding. Later, two detectives came to speak with me, and I thought I was making a good thing, after all, trying to minimize the penalties on those 2 tourists. Police did a search, just for precaution and left. When passengers were invited to board again, an employee from Azul called me and said I was not welcome to the plane. The captain decided he didn’t want me there.  I had to go to my mom’s funeral. My personal opinion should be a reason to turn me on a “persona non grata”. While in my knees, all the employees look to another side. No one look at me. I’m confused and revolted. Where is my right of free speech? I spoke with the police, for God sake! I just wanted to make my point, but the flight captain, on his arrogance, thought he had the right to change the course of my life, just because I cogitate the possibility that they were wrong!?!

2023-03-30,"""One of the worst flights we ever had""",1,"✅ Trip Verified | First we didn’t get an email or any information about the online check in. When we double checked, there was only one row left with two seats so we took them. We got a warning that we’d taken the seats to the emergency exit, but no hint that you couldn’t change the position of the back rest in that row. So we had to sit with a 90 degrees angle all flight long. It was a night flight and if we’d known we would’ve preferred not to sit together and be able to sleep instead. When we asked a stewardess for a pillow or blanket in the attempt to make it a little bit more comfortable for the back and neck, she just answered “one moment please” and simply never came back. So after a while I went to the back where she stood happily chatting with other staff members. I asked again and she kept ignoring me, amazingly rude. Eventually another steward told us that they had neither (again: on a flight at night).

2023-05-12,"""The flight itself was fine""",4,"✅ Trip Verified |  Azul's website is the most amateur circus show I have ever seen. I did not receive a confirmation e-mail upon buying my tickets. I could not find my reservations on the website either, and had to write the company on Facebook to confirm that they existed. To be fair, the Facebook staff was responsive and efficient -- why do they not assign these people to the actual website? There appear to be multiple redundant versions of the company's platform, in multiple languages, and I was kicked between these versions seemingly at random every time I clicked on anything. Online check-in was a three-hour-long living nightmare: the website as a whole seemed to stop working outright multiple times, every step of the procedure (when they happened at all) stalled my laptop for twenty to thirty seconds, and I had to redo the whole thing five or six times, before it actually went through at around one in the morning. As I write this review, I am attempting to check-in for my return flight, which I had the misfortune of taking with Azul as well: I have been trying for over two hours and it will not work. They apparently expect all passengers to have a valid Brazilian CPF (ID number), a phone number fitting in Brazilian standards, and other such information that only exists in Brazil. I am lucky to have lived in Brazil before, else I would have been entirely lost.  I tried buying extra luggage three times through two different versions of the site, one demanded that I have a valid CPF, and the other did not process my payment. Fast-forwarding to the luggage check-in at the airport in Paris, there was only one counter for Economy class.  Business class had four, if I recall. The flight itself was fine. Nothing worth writing home about one way or another. But when you are left more tired and stressed-out by online check-in, a process supposed to last five minutes, than by the subsequent nineteen-hour flight, that is a problem. Spare yourself the ulcers and go with a company that knows how to maintain a functional website.",Economy Class,1,no,89,1,1,1,1,,Solo Leisure,Paris Orly to Rio de Janeiro via Sao Pauo,April 2023,1,,Azul,Brazil
