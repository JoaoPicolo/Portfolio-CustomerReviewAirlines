2013-08-27,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,I had an excellent team of cabin crew on TK1053 to Zagreb on the 21st of August. They were really friendly and warm during the flight. The cold sandwich plus cheese and crackers on 2 hours flight was practical and the portion was good too. The drinks selection was impressive. In general cabin and toilets were in a good condition when knowing it was an older version of an Airbus A320. Keep it up TK.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-08-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,Singapore to Dublin via Istanbul and return Dublin to Singapore also via Istanbul. Appreciate the night kit that they provide on the overnight flight from Istanbul to Singapore. It was in a metal box which is sort of nice and could be a collector's item. First time that I had received such a nice night kit for an overnight flight. Food was good. IFE was reasonably good though films are not the latest. Cabin crew was kept busy as their flights are full on all the four sectors. Turkish Airlines must be doing something right to be attracting some many customers. A consequence of the full flight was the toilets were not cleaned and one was choked throughout the flight back to Singapore without anyone clearing it. Overall a nice experience with THY.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,3,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-09-02,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,Istanbul - Odessa. Flight was full but left and landed on time. Cabin crew were good and managed to serve a reasonable meal on this short flight. I have no hesitation in flying Turkish Airlines as the planes are fairly new and seats are comfortable. There was no inflight entertainment and the English spoken by the crew easy to understand.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,4,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-09-09,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,London to Istanbul 16/08/13 flight TK1980. 2 out of my last 3 flights were delayed. One for 6 hrs on a 3.5 hrs flight and another 1.15 hrs on 50 min flight. There is lack of information and communication from ground staff and poor customer relations. I find food to be average. Never had any problems with cabin crew as they are very professional. I think Turkish Airlines expanded its fleet and destinations too much too soon and now cannot manage it properly.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,N/A,no,6,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-09-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,,The return flight was overbooked hence they put us on a flight 7 hours later. They promised food vouchers but we never got them so ended up buying our own thing. When we were given boarding passes 2 out of 3 of them were hand written which was refused by the immigration officer after 1 hour of queuing. Had to go back to the airline desk and staff behaved as if it was our fault. when they issued printed boarding passes now they changed our seats to the back of the plane! When we eventually boarded the crew again shifted us to other seats. Offered a meal but they only had beef! I asked for a child pack and they did not have that either.

2013-09-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,My first TK A330-300 trip my first Y experience on TK for a long time. The plane was full. I have never seen speciality meals delivered through the same door the pax were boarding very unprofessional. FA asking the gate agents to check some luggage (gate check) they had no idea how to deal with it. I have never seen giant garbage bags piled up at the doors during the flight as if there was no place to store it. Never seen one of the chefs coming off from his rest in a t-shirt carrying his uniform in his hand. It was chaotic for the whole flight constant shuttling of food trays bags drinks back and forth. Slow inattentive service. Good luck to the cleaning crew to turn it around on time. On the plus side most of the front lavatories were larger than I'm used to Thanks to the inflight entertainment iphone and my noise cancelling headphones I was happy. The Y seats were not comfortable for me for the 10.40 hrs flight. I hope I never have to do that again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,8,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

However the cabin crew were so unfriendly and they disappeared after the first service. No water or beverages offering during the flight until next service (breakfast) 2.5 hours before landing.

2013-09-16,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,Flight from Jakarta to Istanbul and on to Luxembourg in Economy. Good seats and service; very full flights but good service from stewards on the long-haul section. Child meals were suitable and served quickly with no problems and inflight entertainment kept them happy. Good selection of toys also helped. I enjoyed Efes beer and a good beef main course with rice. Overall a quality experience and made the long flight relatively painless.

2013-09-17,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,IST to JNB and return. On both legs the business class was disappointing. The best part was the seat: the flight attendants lacked warmth and appeared overwhelmed despite there being so many of them. The food on the inbound leg was especially poor. IFE malfunctioned and had to be rebooted several times. One of the flight attendants spilled wine on me and then told me it was my fault.

2013-09-19,Turkish Airlines customer review,,I travelled along with my Wife from Istanbul to New Delhi on 17th Sep TK 716. While booking the tickets I was assured by the travel agent that the plane would have the full bed facility in business class and that the plane would be A330-300. When I boarded the plane: The Entertainment System was not working. The reading lights could not be switched off with the result that the cabin crew used masking tapes to cover the light. The electronic switches to adjust the seats were not working it was worse than economy class where one can at least recline the seats. The Flight Purser remarked that the airlines have two similar such planes and they always have problems on these planes and this was a last minute change. I will strongly keep away from TKY.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,15,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-09-24,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,Highly disappointing. We flew from Singapore to Germany with an infant and it was horrible. We ordered a bassinet and baby food and neither was given to us. The airline staff did not bring a bassinet for the child and no children were given food on the flight. Furthermore we had to wait for an hour for a bottle of water and the air- conditioning did not work which made it hot and stuffy on the plane. It was the biggest waste of money for the tickets and I would never fly with them again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,16,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-09-29,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,Four flights with Turkish in the past two weeks - all in economy. Cape Town to Istanbul Istanbul to Paris London Gatwick to Istanbul and Istanbul back to Cape Town. All flights were on time or early. The planes were reasonably new clean and comfortable. The flight back to Cape Town was completely full but even that wasn't uncomfortable. The staff were always helpful and polite. The seats are reasonably comfortable with good pitch - my gripe is the foot rest which isn't convenient if you are tall and gets in the way when folded up. The entertainment system is varied and the screens large (no individual screens on the plane from Gatwick). Food was plentiful and tasty. And there are a few extras - a substantial amenity kit - sometimes in a tin. Slippers and a Turkish delight as a welcome sweet. And in addition their prices are excellent so it doesn't surprise me that they keep winning awards.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,17,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-10-01,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,I flew business class from CGK-IST-AMS overall it was a great experience but unfortunately it was not very memorable. The seat itself was great and comfortable the cabin layout was modern and clean however I found out that the cabin crew seemed to be inconsistent. They did not really interact with the passengers less smiles and seemed to lack manners. On the other side indeed there were the dedicated cabin crew who were willing to care and serve the passengers. My verdict is THY is still great airline to fly but it is not really that consistent compared to other airlines.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,19,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-10-02,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,Geneva-Istanbul (A319) - Istanbul-Kuala Lumpur (A340-300) on August 6th-7th 2013. Flight from Geneva to Istanbul was smooth nothing special. Flight from Istanbul to KL service-wise was flawless and seamless. Very attentive service needs were taken care of before you asked and very good food although I have had even better food on other THY flights. My real issue is with the business class seat sleeping comfort on the A340-300.I am not sure at what angle the seat reclines but it is pretty nasty I was annoyed because the ticket price was pretty high. I wonder why Turkish a forward looking airline as using the A340-300 on the IST-KL run with this seating arrangement in business class. I just hope that Turkish will either change the planes on the IST-KL run or do something about the seating in their A340-300.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,20,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-10-03,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,"LAX to Istanbul. No problem except leg room which is rather uncomfortable if you are somewhat tall (5' 8"" and my husband is 6'0"") and it was very warm on the plane. Coming back what really bothered me was that going to the restroom early on in the flight the trash was full and the pump soap was empty. Someone had thrown bars of soap onto the counter. A 13 hour flight with guessing 300 people. Not very sanitary. Staff were polite and courteous. Good entertainment choices. Food average but I'm not the best judge for that.

2013-10-03,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,Sep 25 to fly from Houston to Istanbul. We had about a 20 minute delay but we arrived on time to Istanbul. We flew using Economy and our legs were pretty cramped in there because the guy in front of us who had an exit row leaned his seat back. The food was good and also the movies they had for us to watch were fine. On the flight from Istanbul to Berlin there is a 3 hour flight and once again we are provided with food and movies. This flight is fine. On the return flight on Oct 2 going from Berlin to Istanbul was fine they served breakfast on this flight but no TV was in our seat but that was fine because we were exhausted anyway and just slept. Once we arrived at Istanbul our flight to Houston was on time as far as us getting on the plane however we then had complications. There was a 3 hour delay while on the plane before we took off. We sat in exit row this time with comfortable leg room. Our flight landed about 3 hours late but I was ok with it because it was my final destination.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,22,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-10-07,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,YYZ-IST-YYZ. Turkish is inconsistent. Business class should be perfect from start to finish. Flight to IST was almost that. Return flight had rough edges. Turkish communication between lounge and gate had us waiting in the sweatbox gate long before we needed to be there. No separate boarding for Bus Class in fact we went through security after we had already cleared it-Twice! On board staff demand that blinds must be closed on a day flight.

2013-10-09,Turkish Airlines customer review,,"LOS-IST-TLV. One word: Terrible. B737-900 LOS-IST. No air conditioning at LOS airport and drinks are not allowed into gate. By the time you board most passengers are very thirsty. Requests for water were shrugged off with the response ""later"". How can you refuse water to thirsty passengers. After take off painfully slow dinner service and a small plastic cup with water served. Of course it's not enough. Again FA would not supply more water. I even went to the galley pointed at a full bottle of water and asked for some. Again I was told to return to my seat water will come later. I approached the inflight manager to complain and situation improved. Poor English by pilots and FA's couldn't understand any announcements. No soap in toilets with nothing to dry wet hands on. Smiles from the crew were out of the question. Food was ordinary can't understand where all the fuss about their food in Economy class comes from. Maybe from flights outside Africa. Flight to TLV slightly better crew all in all cant judge all flights they operate but for me it was the last time on TK.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,26,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-10-10,Turkish Airlines customer review,,Dalaman to LHR no problems with the 5 am flight until IST passport control. 1 and 2 had at least 500 people queuing but because I was economy class got barred from business class fast track check so had to push in or miss the 7.55 to LHR. Got to plane with 5 mins to spare got seated and had 3 seats to myself. Just before take off captain announces a big delay and everyone had to get off. He said LHR was fog bound so a 2 hrs delay so back to departure lounge where 3 members of staff proceeded to shout out passenger names to the 200+ passengers so we could retrieve our boarding passes. This was chaos and very unprofessional. 2.5 hr wait then back on the plane where another 150 passengers appeared from nowhere to fill all seats then another 1 hour wait on the tarmac with no explanations before take off - total 3.5 hours delay with no food or drinks. It looks to me that I and the original passengers were held up for 3.5 hours waiting for the plane to fill up.,Economy Class,1,1,1,N/A,1,no,27,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-10-13,Turkish Airlines customer review,,TLV to IAH - totally different experience than the outbound trip two weeks earlier. TLV to IST took off 45 minutes late. A group of us (16 people) with a 1 hour IST connection to the IST-IAH flight were assured we will make our flight (as we were earlier told by the agent after buying the ticket). Upon landing in IST we were gathered and made to run across the terminal to our IST-IAH fanlight only to find out someone probably forgot to ask for this flight to be held for us (despite what we were told). The flight was already in the air. Lots of confusion and lack of initiative led to a 3 hours fiasco before we were rescheduled for the next day's flight. We were taken to a hotel (Radisson). Kosher food was not available and food that was provided was poor at best. Next day flight IST to IAH took off 3 hours late while we were sitting in the cabin with no food or drinks (see previous posts - same experience). Food on the return leg was not as good as on the outbound leg. Bottom line - not sure all the above was worth the troubles. I will have to think long and hard before flying with THY again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,28,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-10-13,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,IAH to TLV - great flights on time. Layover in IST too long in this small airport but bearable.

2013-10-15,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,Our family of five adults recently traveled from Los Angeles (LAX) to IST to DAR and back. The new lounge in IST is gorgeous! The LAX-IST legs were excellent: comfortable seats attentive staff good food. The IST-DAR legs were only fair: seat controls didn't work staff was less than attentive food was mediocre. But the biggest problem we had was with the online reservation system. Even though I had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in. Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in. By using the electronic ticket numbers (and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didn't exist) the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes. Very frustrating! Finally they figured out a work-around and we were able to board.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,30,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-10-18,Turkish Airlines customer review,,My wife and I flew from Istanbul to Abu Dhabi on flight TK 0868 on Thur 17 Oct 2013. It had been a great holiday but the flight out was a real let down. For inexplicable reasons our seats were in a hot zone in the plane and we felt like we were being subjected to some sort of in-flight sauna! We did ask the flight attendant (twice in fact) if she could let the flight engineer know of our discomfort. Nothing changed and our four hour flight was awful (not helped by the fact that my wife already felt under the weather). The staff member to whom we reported the fault appeared genuinely sympathetic but although the rear seats in the plane did get cooler we sweltered the whole trip.

2013-10-18,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,LHR-IST-DAC. LHR-IST in cramped A320 rushed and poor service with cabin crew having very poor English skills. Crew forgot to serve our row and when this was pointed out was shown palm as she was 'busy' and would deal with it when she had time. Finally got meal served 45 minutes later than other passengers. On arrival at Istanbul TK ground staff showed indifference to questions asked about the complimentary 'TourIstanbul' offer for long transits indicating I would have to find out at my own initiative if I could avail it and that they would not be able to provide any advise! Ataturk Airport is busy but has a good selection of duty free and some nice lounges. IST-DAC on leased Meridiana Aircraft. Terrible flight poor service. However flight departed on time and arrived early. I had no in-seat entertainment console/remote as it had been ripped off its place I assume hence was unable to view inflight entertainment - did not miss much it was only 5 channels of not-so-new movies. Cabin crew were lax with security and the service was very poor. TK takes pride in their 'Turkish Hospitality' but I found the hospitality of theirs quite poor to be truthful. I certainly will not be flying with them again. TK is no competition for the likes of EK QR or even BA for that matter.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,36,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-10-18,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,My decision to fly this time with Turkish was based on getting a flight at the most economic price with the shortest stopovers: Stuttgart via Istanbul to Cape Town and back. I was pleasantly surprised! The service at the counter was very professional and friendly. No long queues. No hassle with a bag being slightly too thick (having to be re-packed as done at other airlines) and an allowance of 30kg checked in baggage great. Unlike the often older aircraft used by other airlines the planes Airbus were modern and the entertainment systems worked. The food and refreshments excellent! Service good. What a pleasant surprise to be able to purchase goods at the airport in Istanbul in Euros. My only advisory comment is that Turkish need to train their staff how to handle difficult (or rude) customers as they sometimes seemed to be impatient with these. I will definitely fly Turkish again and highly recommend it.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,37,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-10-20,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,"GVA-IST-KTM return. Inconsistency is the hallmark of Turkish Airlines. It was very nice to have free drinks a nice dinner and an in-flight movie (screens above the seats) on a 3 hour European flight. However on the next leg to Kathmandu there was no seat-back IFE and when they played the movie you got English in one ear and Turkish in the other. (I would have liked a movie to block out the sound of the 3 infants near my seat.) On the way back there were seat back screens all the way even on the short-haul flight back to Geneva. The food was superb although I never know why airlines flying to majority Hindu countries don't have a vegetarian option and Turkish coffee would have been nice. Cabin attendants don't seem too concerned with safety (I don't think they check to see if seatbelts are done up) and while they may appear unfriendly I think many passengers don't pick up on the Turkish ""long-blink-with-pursed-lips"" facial expression equivalent of a smile. The policy of having one cabin attendant per trolley didn't seem to be too efficient. The two-class configuration on short haul (where one of the cabin attendants is designated as a ""chef"") may actually result in a lower staff-passenger ratio for economy passengers compared to a low-cost carrier where they need to sell. At times the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed Short delay on the Kathmandu flights - not a big deal but no explanation. On some sectors the pilots didn't address the passengers at all and other times they did. Finally the complementary tour of Istanbul for transit passengers (including food) is a nice touch. Clearly Turkish have the right idea they just need to standardise their product.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,39,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-10-29,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,London to Dhaka via Istanbul twice in the last month. Usually I have a good experience with Turkish. However this time it was not so great. The London to Istanbul segments were mostly OK with the exception of the last return flight which was one of the most unpleasant flights I have had in a long time. It started with the children from hell in the row behind. The aircraft was an older A321 which had very poor leg room no IFE to speak of and it was too hot. One lady was quite ill because of the heat. The cabin crew refused to do anything despite complaints. I think everyone just wanted to get off so we were not pleased at having to fly around London on hold for half an hour. The Istanbul/Dhaka part is not operated by Turkish but by Meridiana an Italian charter operation. The A330 aircraft are old and do not come close to the normal Turkish standard. The IFE was very limited - no video on demand seats were old and business seats were basic and not worthy of the price. All airlines seem to put their worst and oldest aircraft on the routes into this part of Asia. I have flown with Emirates and Qatar Airways and both do the same. It is unfair as you do not pay any less for the ticket. On the positive side the overcrowding of the business lounge in Istanbul has improved. I did not have to sit on the floor on any of the 3 times I used it.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,46,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-10-29,Turkish Airlines customer review,,Brutal service experience. IST to LHR. Family of 4 with young children. Seats not assigned together (over rode the Travel Agent request). Staff told me it was my problem. Said I had to negotiate seat moves onboard. Departure gate staff appear to be contracted out so don't really care. Not sure why they are part of Star Alliance as they don't seem to care about Star Alliance patrons either. The experience was only made worse by some flight attendants who didn't seem to care much for courtesy and politeness with passengers.

2013-10-29,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,I flew Turkish a couple of times in the past months and the most conspicuous feature was the seats lacking the adjustable headrest often the lack of the footrest and the lack of personal in-flight entertainment. The food was just sufficient. But the worst was on an international overseas flight of 2 hours where the in-flight entertainment on overhead screens was a football documentary. The staff were as kind and helpful as possible and the overall flight was satisfactory.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,48,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

We paid AUD 553 each for the two hour flight (expensive by world standards due to no competition). My partner had the most uncomfortable journey as the obese person was spilling over into his space.

The toilets were much cleaner than on other airliners' planes which was nice. Food was really good and it felt luxurious to be able choose from two menus! They showed quite new movies during the flight but when we flew back to Helsinki there was no sound coming from the audio system. This problem affected all the passengers not just me. The flight attendant couldn't do anything about this problem. What really upset me was the cabin crew's attitude on safety matters. Flight attendants didn't care at all about the position of passengers' seats tray tables or hand luggage during take off and landing. It definitely didn't give a good impression of safety issues.

My seat's earphone plug-in was spoilt therefore inflight entertainment was as good as non-existed. IST-ICN flight entertainment was good but limited choices. Amenities were given on the IST-ICN flight which includes eye mask lip balm ear-plugs socks and slippers. The cabin was warm for some reason it was not like other airline's where the cabin would be cold. Food was tasty but not delicious. Service was average. Rarely notice any drink rounds on the 10 hour flight but they provided a bottle of water after meal.

The online booking and check-in was easy the website is very user friendly (no OLCI at Mombasa though). The planes on HEL-IST-HEL were Airbus equipment one older and one new with state-of-the-art entertainment system. The older one had only overhead screens showing flight tracking only. The seats were a bit cramped could have more legroom. On African sectors brand new B 737-900ER were used. These planes are very comfortable leather seats with good legroom and big seatback screens with latest movies. I must say that they were nicest on-aisle planes I ever flown with. On all sectors the meal and drink service was very good cannot remember when I last could select my meals from menu card in economy class. The cabin service was professional and friendly. Some lack of cabin discipline though people were allowed to walk around and tray tables were used immediately after take-off. All flights arrived on-time and bags delivered.

I was pleased with the overnight travel kit. The food was average but the drinks were plentiful. There were films TV series and music selections but the choices were limited and dated. The touch screens cannot be fully navigated from the remote so the passenger behind me was pecking at my seat repeatedly. The plane was dated and rather warm. No one was using their blankets. Finally the service was rushed and English and Chinese were limited. The English announcements were comical.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,89,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-12-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,Flew from Dusseldorf to Istanbul and Dusseldorf to Sabiha Gokcen. Food was perfect and hostesses were very friendly. Was an old 737-800 without Entertainment System but nothing to complain about because I was reading my Book. Booked 2 months ago and paid only 100 Euro for a round trip.

2013-12-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,First time traveling on Turkish. Chicago ORD - IST and using IST as a hub for additional travel to Sofia and Baku. Flew A330 from ORD-IST in the business class cabin and was very pleased with the excellent service and food. Lay-flat seats were very comfortable. Selection on the entertainment system was good but they had problems and needed to reboot the system a couple of time both on the outbound and return legs. Lounge in Istanbul was excellent and some of the best food compare to any other Star Alliance Gold lounges. I would definitely recommend Turkish Airlines.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,91,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-12-20,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,Inflight service from Kuala Lumpur to Skopje was great and only mediocre from Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur. I had a layover more than 11 hours at Ataturk Airport flying in from Budapest on 15 December 2013 Flight TK 1037 and my connecting flights the 16th at 0055 to KLIA. When I asked one of the airline staff at the transfer desk he said that I could get a hotel during my transit. I was then told to go the Turkish Airline Hotel Desk. The airline staff were very rude and told me that there was no hotel room for me. When I told him my wait was more than 10 hours he just waved his hands and never tried to answer any of my questions.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,95,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-12-21,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,Dhaka - Istanbul on Dec 20th (A330-200). Awful experience - Entertainment system for entire aircraft broken for the duration of flight according to a flight attendant for several days already. Apparently no need to fix things at THY. Open wires at my seat seat adjustment at several seats did not function normally. Overall low seat comfort. Crew inattentive and impolite - when I pointed out that a toilet indicator light was also not functioning I was told that the light for another toilet was working. Many in business class cabin were outraged and several people submitted complaint forms. In short: Third-world economy class product for the price of a business class ticket. How this airline warrants 4 stars is beyond me.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,96,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2013-12-25,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,Flew from ORD to IST then on to ADD in Early December 2013. The leg from Chicago to Istanbul was perfect. Excellent seats attentive staff and excellent food. Check in was east and efficient and all ground and all flight staff were highly professional and friendly. Flight from IST to ADD was on a smaller plane (B737) so the seats were not good but service was fine. The Istanbul airport is total chaos but the business lounge was huge and the food omnipresent. I'd give Turkish Airlines a top rating better than similar flights on Delta or Ethiopian by far!,Business Class,1,1,1,N/A,1,yes,100,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-12-25,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,The overall service is fair. I was booked in economy premium from Scotland to Turkey and then Turkey to Bangladesh. Although I collected my boarding pass for both parts of the journey from Edinburgh airport where I was allocated my chosen seat. On my trip to Bangladesh the cabin crew at the boarding gate had cut my seat number (12K) on the boarding gate with a pen and gave me seat at the very back of the plane. This made my journey very unpleasant. On both parts of my trip the cabin ran out of one of the options on the catering menu.

2013-12-29,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,In December 2013 we flew from Istanbul to JFK - Flight 0003. We had previously flown from JFK to Istanbul a week earlier so we knew what to expect as far as seat comfort movie selection and meals. This time however the flight crew was very different from the last crew. It was obvious from the moment we walked on the plane that the crew was unfriendly and unprofessional. They seemed completely unconcerned for the well being of the passengers. We received a tiny cup of coffee at take off and did not get any more in the 11 hour flight! The beverage cart only came around when meals were served - twice! The bathroom went from clean to disgusting in about three hours and remained that way. It is very disappointing that such a good airline has terrible employees.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,103,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

After reading some of the reviews for Turkish Airlines I was concerned about our trip. We were however pleasantly surprised. The flight crew was friendly accommodating and generous with drinks and food. We flew Economy Class. The seats were as comfortable as they can be after 9.5 hours. The movie selection was good. The crew is what really made the flight great. If all Turkish Airline employees were as good as this flight we would definitely fly with them again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,104,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2013-12-31,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,"Today I am waiting in the busy airport with inadequate facilities in Istanbul airport. It looks like Turkish Airlines are trying to run more than it's capacity can support. I am bound for Dhaka after completing my 15 days holidays in Europe. It was announced just 2 hours before departure that Dhaka flight TK 721 is delayed for 5.55 hrs almost 6 hours. I went to airline desk with sign ""We are here to help"". But in reality we got nothing not even a smiling apology. We came. To know that airline will not provide any help and we were told to spend time in the crowed food court where we had a hard time to get a place to rest. Finally we had to purchase ticket for lounge just to have a place to rest. I am widely travelled and a member of SIA Gold Card holder.

2014-01-02,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,IST to Gatwick London on 25th as a Gold member with other Star Alliance airlines they did not provide a priority baggage handling tag. Lounge at IST was excellent but far too busy at least 10 mins to find a seat and another 10 mins to queue for the foods. If you want to have a shower you may need to wait 90 mins. From London to Istanbul on 30th I was not allowed to use the lounge not allowed to increase check-in baggage allowance and could not check my bags to my final destination. When I re-checked my bags in Istanbul they would not check-in my bag again to Melbourne only to Singapore asked me to re-check them in Singapore. After I arrived in Singapore I checked with ground staff of Singapore airlines who helped me to re-direct my bags to Melbourne and I did not have to do it myself again. The cabin service with TK: staff very unfriendly and do not want to provide services at all. The toilet was disgusting. Only good thing about TK is that they provide a good travel kit.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,106,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Each sector was on time and operated by an aircraft with decent legroom. Meals on board were excellent more bistro than airline food! Transiting at Istanbul airport is as painful as getting through packed Gulf hubs (as Doha and Abu Dhabi) but this is the unavoidable part of the journey! Just two cons: Most of cabin crew and ground staff at IST have really basic English skills. In Dec 2013 online check-in was not available at KL airport making the pre-flight experience a bit hectic.

TK use a shared AENA run lounge in Barajas T1 but it's spacious and food/service offering has just been improved and is good but seats are really old and need a good clean. Flight to IST in brand new 737-800 with comfortable 2-2 seating. Good inflight meal and entertainment. Transfer in IST was horrific - poor signs and the transit for VIP passengers is not highlighted so easy to miss. Miles of walking and it looked like a building site. The lounge was simply overcrowded and staff at reception had an ""I don't care attitude"". Onward flight boarded early no separate line for business class and departed on time.

Staff on various flights were impolite to even rude. A vegetarian meal was ordered and served but turned out to contain meat. After enquiring they simply took back the meal and served a new one without saying a single word. No apology - nothing. Other questions were answered with grimaces only not words. Safety instructions from staff before landing sound more like army orders. The media box in their A340 takes half of the foot space absolutely inconvenient on long distance. The inflight entertainment doesn't contain new releases only old movies. The schedule as per magazine doesn’t comply with the entertainment system. Furthermore very limited language options on some flights only. The food was very good on one flight average on 2 and un-enjoyable on the 4th flight. Journey time was quite long. Website looks antiquated not possible to order special meal only by phone. Online check-in not possible for some origins but they tell you only after all data like passport number date of birth has been entered already. The transfer in their Istanbul hub is horrible.

2014-01-20,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,LHR-IST-LHR over the Christmas - We use this airline regularly as they offer a good choice of flights from London with convenient departure times and have always been impressed with the quality of inflight service. B777-300 in both directions - aircraft was very clean and looked reasonably new. Very tasty meals were served in both directions and the Turkish Delight shortly after take-off is a nice touch. Good choice of drinks offered with the meal although it's true to say that they don't regularly pass through the cabin with the drinks trolley (to be honest there aren't many airlines that do these days - especially in economy) all you have to do is ask and they will serve you with a smile! The AVOD offered a good choice of TV and movies - the 4h flight passed very quickly. It's worth remembering however that some of the flights from London use smaller B737 or A320 family aircraft and may not have personal TVs in economy. The 11.40 and 16.10 flights from LHR generally use A330s / 777s. We have flown on smaller planes and the service is fine but not quite as much legroom as on the 777. Overall the flights were very comfortable with good in-flight service and compare favourably with many Western European airlines that I have flown on and have no hesitation in recommending them.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,134,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Crew were very unfriendly without taking any notice of us. Shortly after take-off we got Turkish delights. Then it took a very long time before we got our meal. According to the menu you had the choice of two meals but when they reached my row no choice and a very cold meal. On the A321 you had theoretically inflight entertainment. The menu of the display was in Turkish English German French Arabic but only the menu. The movies etc. were only in Turkish. Summary: Delayed bad service cold meals unfriendly staff chaotic situation at the airport in Istanbul.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,136,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-20,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,Flew Turkish Airlines for the first time in December Business Class from Dhaka to Vienna return Paris to Dhaka. We were disappointed in a number of things. There was no entertainment service (out of order both ways) and the attendants while not unpleasant were more interested in chatting than serving. The food was excellent and the beds OK. The rap highlight however was the Istanbul lounge which must be amongst the best in the world. Fabulous food and services.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,137,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-22,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,Flight from MUC to IST. We left on time but when we reached IST we had to wait about 25 mins on the airfield. The crew were very unfriendly without saying 'hello' on entering the plane. Shortly after take off we got Turkish Delights then nothing more for 1.5 hrs. According to the menu we had the choice of two meals but when staff arrived at my row there was no choice. The meal was cold drinks and meal served together.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,138,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-22,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,KTM-IST-LHR 28/12/2013. A330-300 flight from KTM was delayed around 5 hours. Not much information given apart from aircraft was circling above probably due to fog but other flights although smaller jets landed up to 2 hours earlier. On board aircraft had no personal screens and on take off the Captain announced there would be no IFE with no reason given. Transit at IST should have been 6 hours but due to the delay we had a 1 hour transfer so a rush to the departure gate. Flight to LHR arrived a half hour early but checked in baggage was left in IST. This was delivered on the next flight and delivered by courier the next day.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,139,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-22,Turkish Airlines customer review,3,On Jan 17th we went from DXB to IST. This flight was awful. Normally they have quite a lot space in economy class but not in this Boeing we really had to squeeze ourselves between the seat rows! Also they had no control over the hand luggage. Passengers came with really large bags and cases which that were not at all suitable to be stored in the cabin. When the lockers were full some passengers started arguing. This was chaos! Until this point we had always been satisfied with THY but this time we were disappointed. The connecting flight from IST to LEJ as well as the onward flights some days ago were much better.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,140,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-23,Turkish Airlines customer review,3,BKK-SGN. Very disappointed upon a first good impression that did not last: Aircraft 777-300 were old and worn. Staff pretend to be kind but were just assuming they could speak English. Basically no food on board and a very very poor cold sandwiched was made from remnants from the previous leg flown. Horrible. The 2 staff dressed as cooks were a joke: apart from clothes not clean they were just pretending and no foods were ever cooked or made for the flight. Could not get additional food. They told me that the cheese was spoiled by heat from the previous trip. An FA agreed to offer me anyway but never came to me again. The mayonnaise in the sandwich were not good and too much. After hard negotiations got a glass of champagne but no info of provenance. Menu cards were wishful thinking. Seats worn and torn arranged in herring pattern poorly arranged and most provided no view. No earphones provided. No travel kit no magazines no papers nothing of anything! Seat pockets were empty except for air-sick bags and safety/emergency info card. Staff kept away from cabin as they had nothing to offer. At least they admitted that they had ran short of supplies. We were then forced seated as they announced we were to land soon. That gave them excuse for further denials of drinks and snacks and food. I was allowed to try their ancient 1st class and was impressed by the very old design and spacious cabin with 4 windows at a seat. The cabin was closed for service however as only business class is sold. Give only score 3 out of 10: two for being on time and one for an FA for being honest enough to admit food crises on board.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,141,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-25,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,TK 713 Dhaka - Istanbul Dec 13 2013 and TK 712 Istanbul - Dhaka Jan 9 2014. The airline is turning from slight above average to a complete disaster on their Dhaka bound flights. Now they are using their oldest A330-203 with no inflight entertainment at all. Seats are sometimes broken. Even the last resort of comfort the reading lights are not working or wrongly wired and therefore useless or really annoying. FAs are trying to cope with it but you can see that it even annoys them to work on a plane like this. They will even wake you up in the middle of the night to serve breakfast when everybody was sleeping. When I got shook awake despite having a sleeping mask on and questioned them they said it is normal for them to serve at this time as it was morning in Istanbul (5 hours away). Dhaka is not an easy destination but Turkish is doing everything to make it the worst for the average passenger. In winter when there is morning fog in Dhaka Turkish is the only carrier that does not dare to change their flight schedule like Emirates or Qatar but prefers to have their flights delayed by 5 hours without prior notification. It had now happened 3 times travelling from Dhaka or Istanbul. Only positive thing is the quality of the food which is usually good and tasty and drinks policy. Nevertheless this was my last flight with them after I was a loyal traveller due to affordable price.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,142,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,TK34 from Houston to Istanbul with friends. First time with Turkish and we were very satisfied. Seats were comfortable and the service was good.

2014-01-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,"JFK-Istanbul-Bangkok. While the crew were not overwhelmingly friendly they did their jobs efficiently and mostly with smiles. What sets Turkish Airlines apart besides their phenomenal lounge at the Istanbul Airport is the quality and quantity of the food that they serve on board. Whereas on most other airlines you get a choice of perhaps 3 different appetizers to choose from on Turkish Airlines they have a whole trolley filled with different Turkish appetizers from you to select. You can try as many as you want. The same logic holds true for desserts. You had perhaps 10 different options to choose from. The seats on both flights were not of the ""lie flat"" variety but were comfortable nonetheless. My only true complaint dealt with the cabin temperature. The crew kept the temperature fairly warm on both flights. I did ask one of the attendants to lower the temperature on the flight to Istanbul which she did. But in about an hour or two later the temperature was warm again. Offerings in the amenity kits provided were generous and the cabins and rest rooms were kept fairly clean throughout both flights. Lastly it really is a bit comical to see one or two of the flight attendants dressed up as chefs given that none of the food is prepared on board.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,144,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-30,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,NRT - Istanbul - Barcelona. Plenty of food and snacks on the long haul flight - I love how they give out Turkish Delights just after take off and a meal menu on all flights. The only complaint was the friendliness of the crew who always looked grumpy and a few were falling asleep at their crew seats during taking off and landing on both sectors. Once they completed their meal service they disappeared and were chatting non stop at the back of the plane with other crew. Other than this a good 2 sectors with TK.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,145,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-01-30,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,Geneva - Istanbul TK1918 19 Dec 2013. Istanbul - Dhaka 19 Dec 2013 TK0712. Dhaka - Istanbul 9 Jan 2014. Istanbul - Geneva 10 Jan 2014. No inflight entertainment on flight from Istanbul to Dhaka or from Dhaka to Istanbul. On January 9 flight from Dhaka to Istanbul was delayed 7 hours due to fog. When the flight finally took off on 9 Jan flight time from Dhaka to Istanbul (non-stop) was 8.5 hours due a ridiculously old plane being used. I was informed in Dhaka on 9 Jan that I would miss my connecting flight to Geneva and would have to travel the next morning and was thus issued a boarding pass for the next day. When we arrived in Istanbul no instructions were given by the cabin crew leaving passengers to figure things out on their own. It took another 2.5 hours for ground staff to issue us hotel vouchers. Some toilets were non-functional on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka on 19 December. All crew members on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka and back appeared to be Turkish and spoke very basic English. Plus points: Staff of Turkish airlines in Dhaka were most professional and courteous and did their best to attend to the needs of passengers. Food was decent. Overall - a very lousy experience. There is a major difference in the quality of service (old planes no in-flight entertainment rude/unprofessional service) on the flight to/from Dhaka-Istanbul compared to flights to/from Istanbul-Geneva.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,146,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Although we were delayed 4 hours in Manchester due to high winds (not a problem) we had a lovely smooth flight the business class seats on this plane are excellent plenty of room and fully reclining. Very good service once seated a glass of juice or wine was offered then a lovely salmon salad later a choice of chicken beef or macaroni - plenty to eat and wines excellent.

2014-02-10,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,Flew CPH-IST-Bombay mid December 2013. One more good experience with THY all flights on time and service as expected good. No other European carrier serves this amount of meals on intraeuropean flights and service about the same on intercontinental. As a regular flyer on THY in recent years I would recommend changing the meals a little - on all 4 flights food was the same as before always delicious but perhaps a little tired compared to some years ago. Beverage service excellent and although staff of THY are not very smiley they were effective. Inflight entertainment good with good selection of movies both older and recently published. Transfer in IST chaotic on way out very smooth on return flight. Again I can recommend THY for both service costs and extensive route network.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,152,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-02-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,9th Feb TK70. We purchased our tickets from London to Istanbul and then from Istanbul on to Hong Kong almost as soon as they were released 11 months before we were due to travel. Perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point. We didn't worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early. This turned out to be a naive assumption! When we attempted to check in online which was more than 36 hours before the Istanbul to Hong Kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin. Our pleas to the Turkish airlines office in London the check in desk at Gatwick and the transfer desk at Istanbul were all to no avail. This completely ruined the flight for me whilst I respect that the airline couldn't bump someone from a pre booked seat we should have been sat together by default at point of booking.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,153,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-02-13,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,IST-EZE GRU-IST Economy. I am a frequent flyer with TK (Elite) and there are many things I like about TK but the biggest problem of this airline is consistency. Some flights are excellent while others are just a horrible experience. This happened with my flights to EZE and back from GRU. The plane on both legs was awful. Under each seat there is a big metal box which makes it unbearable in combination with the tight legroom. Overall the plane seemed old and not taken care of. It had not been cleaned properly before departure. The staff were not attentive forgetting my requests. On the return flight there was no menu no hot towel no fresh orange juice. The temperature during the flight - freezing. The lounge in GRU is a joke. The good TAM lounge is closed at night and they use the Smiles lounge which is simply not acceptable. Ground handling poor - my priority has not been recognized at baggage delivery and for the return flight the check in staff didn't attach the priority label at all. All in all if I only took this one flight and judged TK based on this experience I would definitely not recommend this airline.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,154,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

They managed to serve breakfast on this short flight and a bar service. The only bad remark cabin very hot during boarding terrible welcome. It got better as we took off. Remote parking in IST bussed to terminal. Security much quicker than expected. Departure area crowded and stuffy as usual. Again boarded A321 steaming hot. This time legroom was atrocious could not move or eat? The B737-800 felt like business class compared to this torture. Crew friendly and hard working full hot meal service wine beer and alcohol were free. This time personal IFE. Product seems inconsistent.

2014-02-21,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,JNB-IST-WAW 13 and 14th Feb. Flights on time. Metal was A330 and A321 respectively. The long haul was excellent with many food and drink choices. Wines from 4-5 continents ranging from rose champagne red and whites selected from within a wide range just to my taste. FA attendants were frequent and respectful. IFE maybe the best I've seen and easy to operate. Huge monitors. Bed not fully lie flat so I actually turned around and laid my head on the stool and slept better with my legs in slight upward position. Night-kit given was boring and superfluous. Check-in at transit in JNB only possible 3 hours prior to departure. However was allowed through security without boarding cards as to kill time in the SAA-lounges. When the check in lady eventually appeared at transit she was professional and kind and managed even to trace my luggage and give it an additional (needed) label so I could transfer it throughout. The corresponding luggage receipt was smoothly given to me as I entered the stairs boarding the aircraft. The lounge in IST was extended with a huge under-deck 3 days ago and is a world-class positive experience in design space beauty and service provided. IST-WAW on Airbus 321-200. Not business class seat but ordinary economy with tabled middle seat to increase space in the 3x3 configuration. IFE on small ceiling monitors were useless. Staff were alert and kind. As usual for TK one was dressed up pretending to be a cook despite we were only 4 pax in business out of 12 possible. Food very good varied and wide options inc. of individual cheese plates deserts etc. Even champagne was offered on this European flight of a duration of only 2+ hours.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,158,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-02-21,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,HEL-IST-TLV 19 Feb. Fog in IST kept us delayed in HEL for 3 hours. Updates from gate agents left much to be desired. 45 minutes circling the foggy airport not a nice feeling but eventually landed safely. Next flight to TLV delayed 4 hours. No gate personnel present until boarding. No amenities offered. HEL-IST A319 with no IFE at all. Crew friendly and nice meal/bar service. Generous with alcohol. IST-TLV A321 with IFE at every seat. Leg room a disaster compared to other TK a/c. Again all female crew friendly nice food. I also noticed that on all 4 flights the aircraft's were never air-conditioned. It meant sitting in a very warm stuffy and crowded plane until they were ready to go. Not a very welcoming environment. All in all good service.

Its true that they offer good amounts of food but the quality was poor on all these sectors. Completely tasteless meals served by flight attendants that did not smile at all and did not understand English. The cabins of the long sectors IST- BKK and SIN-IST were also quite dirty.

Before takeoff they served Turkish Delight in economy class which is something never to be seen on any other European airlines. They even arranged my vegetarian meal from business class as it was not loaded. TK serves fresh orange juice and lemonade which is perhaps the best drink I have had on onboard! Meals are always tasty and crew are friendly and helpful although I have to say that Chef-onboard service is absolutely useless. Chef did not even know what the vegetarian meal was on TK flights but thanks to the crew who got me something to eat although it came an hour after the service. The legspace is acceptable and much better than Air Berlin and Lufthansa though one of their aircraft's was so old that I could hold the seat cushion. All in all it was a pleasant experience.

This was a very bad experience you had to go through security control and I had only a limited time for connection. It was overcrowded and disorganized. We started with delays because of disorganization. They checked whether everybody had a visa or permission to go to a Schengen country. Why did they not check it when getting the boarding pass. Entering the plane very unfriendly crew. They served everything without smiles not speaking English? Like always theoretically the choice of two meals but on reaching row # 18 there was no longer a choice. Only one kind of meal left.

This was followed by drinks and meal. JFK-IST served 2 meals and IST-BOM had one. Leg room for economy was pretty much what I expected. IFE was quite good. New movies shows and free WIFI which was of course slow but worked. They also have USB media so you could just snap your flash drive and it will play the songs / media on it. I have travelled on Cathay Qatar and Emirates and while they do have the USB slot it wouldn't play media but this one did. Staff were courteous and polite. The IST-JFK sector had many vacant seats in Comfort class but they wanted 260 Euros which I didn't got for.

Their planes are very up to date modern interior fantastic food great lie flat seats and generous sized IFE with a wide selection of films. The CIP lounge in IST was also very very good! Customer service has ample room for improvement. Perhaps its a cultural thing but I didn't find the cabin crew nor the staff in the lounge particularly forthcoming. In fact they were all quite arrogant individuals which appeared to hate their jobs.

Last trip on TK was few years back and since many fellow travellers on this forum have suggested TK to be inconsistent nowadays we didn't expect anything really. TK turned out to be very good on all four sectors: all flights on time or ahead of schedule all aircraft quite new with great legroom and good IFE that had many interesting options. Moreover the hot meals by DO&CO were of high quality compared to any big European competitor - I still prefer proper food on flights over 3 hrs instead of a sandwich if a meal is served. Human interaction is always a matter of personal taste: for us the cabin crews on these full flights were perfectly fine with good command of English - plus many smiles all the way. All in all TK was very comfortable and great value really.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,170,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-03-07,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,We chose the airline for the good price they have in Business Class and also for the fantastic lounge in Istanbul. The hard product on long distance planes are great but the 737 and 320 that we flew ARN-IST with is just normal economy seats with blocked middle seat. The food is good but the service level is low. Priority boarding is a big no. Everyone is let onboard straight away. The Cabin Crew hardly says hello as you enter the aircraft and dinner service is slow. A smile is very unusual on Turkish. So pay for a good seat (on long distance flights) ok food onboard and a good lounge in Istanbul. Service level is very low.

On the flight from Istanbul to Kathmandu the plane was old and shabby with very little space the lights at the seats did not work so the light was on in the cabin all night there were no screens in front of the seats and no entertainment not even information on the flight on the small communal screens. Nobody served water or anything during the night dinner was OK but meagre and as a vegetarian I got only half the food of those who had ordered meat. I asked for more but the staff member never came back with it. The flight could not land in Kathmandu due to fog. We were 5 hours late with an extra landing in New Delhi with no food or drink and arrived 5 hours late with no offer of compensation. On the way back again more than 5 hours delay without information as to why as we arrived in Istanbul it took ages to get tickets for a meal in the airport and when we got them we could only use them in the fast food restaurants in the food court and had to pay ourselves if we wanted to sit in a decent place.

2014-03-14,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,LGW to CPT - 27/28 February in Economy. Both planes very full. Easy boarding in London - less so in Istanbul where it was necessary to board a coach to go to the plane. Seats on both were comfortable and inflight entertainment good. Food excellent - special meal provided as requested. Staff very helpful on board and good amenity kit. Highly recommended especially if you can get a promotional fare. Security check on transfer at Istanbul simplified and no lines.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,176,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-03-17,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,London-Istanbul-Beijing Economy class. I have to say this is the best economy class I have experienced. For both segments Turkish delights are served immediately after takeoff the food is completely at different classes against other European airlines juice was freshly squeeze orange juice. For the long haul flight we were given slippers ear phones toothbrush and toothpaste and so on which you do not expect in economy class. However the drawback is the geography of Turkey has made the flight much longer and the staff in the Istanbul airport are absolute nightmare although they are not the faults of the airline. However I have worries about passenger behaviour once the aircraft has touched down people are standing up and collecting their luggage from the overhead storage this is the case whether the aircraft is either still on or just leaving the main landing ways. I feel sorry for the cabin crews as there are just so many people and there are little things the crews could do about it.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,177,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-03-17,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,BCN-IST-LJU in economy 7 March 2014. One of the better flights on Turkish. What bothers me is the inconstancy of service staff and maintenance of flight. 1 good flight out of 10. I always select a seat when booking but somehow when I check in TK always change the seat. As a Gold member I am not able to select exit rows either not even at online check-in. On both flights I was comfortable however having an aisle seat the middle sear next to me was empty the cabin was not hot at this time and the service was rather good. We were however delayed out of IST for more than 20 mins. but arrived 5 mins late to LJU. I will not fly Turkish for another year let's see if they get better.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,178,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I am back from my recent trip to Nepal and I have to say this has been the worst trip I had taken so far. Return trip from Kathmandu to Istanbul was delayed 6 hours thereby missing my connecting flight to USA. They re-routed me through Canada the next day and my baggage was left in Istanbul.

I was lured to this airline by their extensive advertising I wish they saved the costs of advertising to improve their equipment and services. I paid for business class and I didn't even get anything near decent economy standard. The plane was old. The seats were in a very bad state. Boarding was chaotic. The second flight was on 25th Jan IST-HBE. Although I paid for a business class seat all I got was an economy seat at the front of the plane.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,180,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-03-25,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,I flew on flight #8 from IAD to IST and was quite impressed food was very good entertainment could be better but I guess it is enough to get by. Service is good however you might encounter a little attitude at times from the flight attendants. The departure back to IAD on flight #7 was also quite nice with some attitude problems from some flight attendants. Departure from IST is a bit disorganised you have to go trough a lot of security to board that flight to DC in Istanbul. I would fly this way again to go to Europe my final destination was Zurich Switzerland and those flights were great and on time.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,181,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-03-27,Turkish Airlines customer review,3,My husband I are seasoned travellers. We travelled to Kathmandu from the UK via Birmingham and back again with a 3 day stop over in Istanbul. On our journey back we missed our flight due to a faulty flight display system which did not show that the plane was boarding and a public announcement system which did not announce the flight. The staff on the ground were rude discourteous and unhelpful. It took the airport staff to help us. Much needs to be done to improve services.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,183,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-03-27,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,I flew TK1939 (IST-BRU) in an Airbus 321. I had forgotten how pleasant flying economy class could be after all those hated Ryanair flights. Every seat has a personal screen with loads of movies to chose from. Fortunately the 3 hour flight gave me enough time to watch a full movie. Food was delicious. They even brought a menu with a choice of two plates. Wine was free. There even was a cook (complete with a cook hat). I know -it's just a flight attendant dressed differently but I bought it. Being a Gold elite member at Star Alliance I had access to the Turkish Airlines lounge before the flight. Truly wonderful. Spacious a great buffet and even a golf simulator to kill time. From now on I will use Turkish Airlines for all my flights to Asia avoiding Lufthansa and Frankfurt or Munich!,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,184,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-03-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,IST-JIB with return. Both sectors brand new A321 with very good IFE. Food always above standards and plenty of soft drinks (no spirits on these flights). Cabin crew very attentive. The outbound leg arrived 30 minutes early. However the return had a delay of 30 minutes and I had a connection flight to catch (1h 30 min). This is the biggest issue with THY. Ground handling in IST. Although they were informed they did nothing. Long bus ride and then the chaotic security control of IST airport. The only reason that I didn't miss the next flight was a 20 minute delay. As far as it goes for value for money.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,185,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-03-30,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,I flew in business class from Zurich to Johannesburg and back via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Their business class product for short haul was by far the best business class I have experienced in Europe. The crew were friendly and efficient the seat pitch was good and the food was absolutely great. The lounge in Istanbul is one of the nicest business class lounges I have been in. The long-haul sector to Johannesburg and back was also great. OK the seat and the inflight entertainment and not the most modern but they were well within acceptable bounds. Once again flight crews were friendly and efficient. No problems at any time with ground services. No delays and bags all delivered promptly and in good shape.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,186,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-04-01,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,We boarded a flight from Edin to Istanbul on 23/3/14. The cabin was rather small (seating of 2 and 3) and the air- conditioning was rather warm! Seats can be rather cramped if you are on the plus size. No negative comments about the food though. However Istanbul airport was chaotic. Going through passport control took us a good one hour. The next leg of our flight was Istanbul -Kuala Lumpur on a much bigger plane. Again the food was satisfactory. Service was ok and inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies. Nevertheless the cabin temperature was a bit warm. We got a good deal on the tickets (1900 pounds for 5 pax) so I guess I shouldn't complain much.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,187,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Onboard the aircraft personal reading lights were either on and flight attendants were not able to switch them off or vv. IFE was only showing the flight information. The AVOD system was working for half an hour only then it crashed and flight attendants neither attempted to reset it nor was any announcement made regarding this.

Boarding on CPT flight chaotic - started before doors to ramp open so standing around a long time. Flight very full - seats less comfortable than the 737 (older 330) and less leg room.

When dinner was served it was very late so I turned it down not asked if I wanted breakfast and was not offered it on waking up. Come on Turkish you tell a good story but in reality.

They smiled and were extremely polite which is something that seems to be lacking across a number of airlines. Aircraft was very clean in great condition and the interior - in turquoise colour had a calming Mediterranean feeling to it. We were offered Turkish delights and dried fruit. Dinner followed it was sumptuous served with a variety of wines and other drinks. It was a pleasant 8 hour flight I was comfortable throughout. Toilets were spacious and clean.

Went from Gatwick to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul experienced a long delay on the outward leg at Istanbul but otherwise flights were on time. Staff were very attentive and the food was excellent. When transferring flights at Istanbul on the return leg queues were dreadful requiring us to go through security again - this needs to be sorted out!

2014-04-08,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,TK1980 (14/3/2014) and 1985 (31/3/2014). Flights both outward and in were nightmares. For economy passengers the cabin seats food etc were fine. The cabin crew onboard were courteous enough. Onboard entertainment on outward flight was fine. The connecting flights were the ones that caused problems. On our outward journey there was only one hour allowed for us to get to the connecting flight from Istanbul to Dhaka. This one hour is too little. I am 71 years old and I was made to run behind the porter who was young and strong and was running and pushing my wife in a wheelchair through various check points to get us to the connecting flights on time. On the way back it was even worse. This time the time allowed for changeover at Istanbul was 1.5 hrs. The plane arrived late and after a very long wait the plane eventually stopped on one part of the runway. Passengers were bussed away and then the marathon began for them to get to the terminal for connecting flights. Same again running behind the porter pushing and running with my wife in the wheelchair. He managed to get us to the plane but just. There was no onboard entertainment on the flight from Dhaka to Istanbul.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,196,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Coming back from Istanbul to Houston on April 6th all the flight attendants were missing in action for about 6-7 hours. They ran out of chicken by the time they got to row 31. No beverages were offered for hours and after ringing 3 times and getting nowhere I had to get up and go and look for someone. Service has gone down considerably since 2008.

On Board: Turkish's Comfort Class well done food service and comfort. Seat was not great for sleep but we managed. Arriving very late at IST and line up for passport control for over 45 minutes we felt fortunate that our luggage was still there as it was almost an hour before we got to luggage belt.

2014-04-13,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,I'm a frequent traveler hopping on planes every couple of weeks for U.S. domestic and European travel and my recent experience flying Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to JFK is the worst flight experience I have had. It started with not being able to contact the airline on the day of the flight to confirm the flight time on March 30th a day that Europe moved to daylight saving time but the Turkish government for some odd reason decided to delay the switch for twenty-four hours at the last minute. Next a surly person at the Turkish Airline check-in counter followed by a lengthy delay for takeoff due to the computer-automated baggage system being down. On the flight my travel companion and I were separated by the flight crew to accommodate a family that wanted to be seated together. We repeatedly told them we were traveling together he was moved to economy plus/business with plenty of seats around him but they refused to move me. So on an eleven-hour flight I ended up with no one to chat with. Finally the plane was full of toddlers and clearly the flight crew was having difficulty keeping the bathrooms clean and the cabin ended up smelling awful for the last 2 to 3 hours of the flight. On pulling out my laptop to do some work I discovered there was not enough room with the seat in front of me to actually open the laptop fully.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,201,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-04-16,Turkish Airlines customer review,3,I fly every 3 weeks on Turkish. Having a good experience is like a game of roulette. Some aircraft's are excellent others very old and shabby. Economy class does what it says on the tin but Business class is generally below the standard of peers. However one thing is constant: the poor level of service. If anything goes wrong or if you have a special request just forget about it and remember this is an emerging airline. Cheap A to B in economy why not?

On the intercontinental segments both the appetizer and the dessert are chosen from a cart laden (truly) with an incredible selection of options. The menu is extensive and provides something for every taste. While food in Business Class is generally good on every airline Turkish takes it to a new level and provides and experience worth anticipation. The crews are friendly and the seating is comfortable for long flights.

2014-04-19,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,TXL-IST-KRT return. With Lufthansa stopping its flights to KRT in January no major European airline flies there anymore. Thus flying from Europe the shortest route one has to take either Turkish Airlines or Egyptair. Since I had good experience with THY in the past I took them once again and have no complaints except for the 50 mins delay on the IST-KRT leg and the fact that they stopped serving alcohol on flights to sharia-law countries such as Sudan. The food was good and seats in the 738 were comfortable providing sufficient legroom even for a 4.10 hrs IST-KRT flight. Ataturk airport has been renovated since my last visit there and the wait for the connecting flights was quite pleasant.,Economy Class,1,1,1,N/A,1,yes,207,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Service good staff efficient but indifferent on the long-haul flights with food below par on occasion particularly breakfast. Dinner on both long-haul sectors meals edible. Drinks plentiful with frequent top-ups. Entertainment excellent with plenty of choice of movies and programming.

2014-04-23,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,Travelled ESB-IST-LHR and return 2/4/14 and 7/4/14. Both sets of flights and aircraft were satisfactory. Flight between Ankara and Istanbul is short so the crew have just enough time to give out the picnic baskets of food before descent commences. Sandwiches are served on the domestic flights which are ok but not a substitute for a proper meal. London flights were ok food was served within the first hour of the flight but then the cabin crew were almost non-existent for the remainder of the flight. Selection of food was not available to me on both international flights probably because I was sat in an exit row half way down the aircraft. It was beef or nothing. Connection between the two flights was stressful as navigating Ataturk airport customs is a long process. The most disappointing thing about the flights is the attitude of the cabin crew towards the safety rules. Many passengers on Turkish Airlines do not observe the seatbelt sign and will get out of their seats while the aircraft is taxiing to open overhead lockers. This occurred on all flights and the cabin crew were indifferent and didn't say a thing on all occasions. This is a very different attitude compared with other airlines. The command of English of the cabin crew and at times the pilots is quite poor also which is surprising for a growing international airline.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,209,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Flight attendants were very nice to me for all flights. Food was very good! Eggplant stuffed with minced beef was fantastic! JFK-IST and IST-JFK flights had good IFE with many music and movie selections to choose from. TLV-IST and IST-TLV flights had no inflight entertainment but this was only a two hour flight so I just slept. Seats were nice for economy.

2014-04-27,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,Flew MAN-MBA return in April. Both legs to and from MAN-IST were full. The service was great with a full meal and a good selection of drinks for economy. We had Exit row seats and had ample leg room. Full use of the entertainment system on these legs (good for 3.40 hour flight) and a decent selection of films however the games were not much to have. All fights on time and no luggage issues. Check-in staff in Manchester were very good and helpful and Mombassa staff polite friendly and obliging too. Long-haul flight on single aisle 737-900 service good though not quite the same high standard of the MAN-IST leg. On 7 hour flight to MBA only one full meal service thought they could of managed at least another drinks service many passengers went to the galley to get a drink. The return flight (4.00am) an average breakfast was served and sandwich snack before landing same entertainment system. This flight also included flight socks and shades which was a plus. FAs were friendly on the whole (male FAs more so then the female) though not always obliging and scarce once the meal service was over. Overall a really good experience and superior too many other European airlines would not hesitate one bit to flight them again in fact would prefer too - price wise very competitive and even cheaper too. Look forward to flying with them again. One tip - give yourself time to transfer at a busy Istanbul airport.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,212,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

The return flight was not as pleasant the inflight entertainment system was not working. I asked the cabin crew if they could help but they were far too busy. Eventually after a long wait I was relocated to another seat similarly on the new seat the inflight entertainment system was not working.

We took of on time and landed 15 minutes early. Return flight on 29th April was a bit hectic after we missed our return flight to Nairobi Turkish Airlines offered to help us and after clearing with them the main problem was our bags.

The flight arrived on time and the cabin crew were very polite. The service was excellent with on demand entertainment comfortable reclining seats to sleep in and a complimentary meal service. This was not at all like flying with the USA's airlines where the staff are usually brusque and rude and the service generally terrible. I very much recommend Turkish Airlines for long haul business class.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,216,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-05-03,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,IST-YYZ. Pretty much a good experience except that the overhead luggage storage was completely stuffed full as we boarded the aircraft. This created tension and stress as we did not want to store our belongings way down the aisle. We discovered that it was in fact the cabin crew that had plugged the overheads with their personal luggage and not even the crew from our cabin. I have flown with Turkish many times and I wish they would understand that little things like this do matter very much to the traveller.,Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,yes,217,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-05-06,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,I read so many bad reviews of Turkish I was a bit sceptical when I boarded. The flights we took were round trip from Houston to Istanbul. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. The plane was comfortable with adequate legroom in economy. Very good inflight entertainment system. Food was excellent. We especially liked that snacks/drinks during the mid-flight time (after first meal and before second) were all self service. Very convenient. My only complaint would be the lavatory got messy fast and never really felt clean. Flight out of Houston was one hour late out of Istanbul was right on time.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,218,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-05-08,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,This was the first time I've flown Turkish airlines so I wasn't sure what to expect. The flight from Houston to Istanbul was great and flight attendants were fantastic. But the flight from Istanbul to Houston was bizarre. I had to show my ticket stub 4 times to prove I was in the correct area (not just me everyone had to show their ticket stub) and they placed stickers on unoccupied seats so they could tell if someone changed seats. Turkish Airlines apparently has a weird policy of not letting customers upgrade to premium seating when seats are available. They spend way too much time monitoring the empty seats. They really made my trip feel cheap and uncomfortable.,Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,no,219,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-05-11,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,While planning a trip to Istanbul we decided on Turkish Airlines mainly due to low fares out of Houston. We booked economy and were a little concerned due to some negative reviews but we have no regrets but do have a few observations. Check in at Houston was fine we decided to upgrade to comfort class at check in there was no offer or signs we just asked. It cost us $350 each for one way but we are glad we did it. Roomy seats nice amenities and good food in comfort class. The in flight entertainment was not so great mostly older movies but we slept just fine. We had concerns about the temperature in flight and yes it was too warm. On our return from IST the check in was chaotic at best. Flight was fine food and amenities were about the same as comfort class so we are glad we did not pay to upgrade. Overall we would not hesitate to fly THY again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,222,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Great In flight entertainment with large personal touchscreens USB and AC ports. Free Wi-Fi offered. Seats were fairly comfortable and planes in great condition. Ordered a vegan meal (VGML) and got a vegan hot meal with dairy salads deserts and butter - however staff were helpful and replaced salad and desert with vegan ones. Food quality was good but nothing to rave about. Fresh squeezed juice pop and alcoholic beverages were offered. Overall satisfied and would fly again.

The inflight hard- ware experience is very good (seat toilets aircraft IFE etc.) but the human resources are like a lottery of low probabilities of meeting a winner or just someone to recall after a week…BUD-IST-BUD sectors on A319 and B737 respectively. Only 2 rows assigned for business class and the seats were economy seats. However with only two passengers for the 12 seats available space was more than enough and one could lay down stretched out by lifting armrests. As for B737 there were old but true business class seats in a 2x2 configurations in 3 rows). Flights on time. Excellent service on board. Champagne at take-off. Special meal ordered almost a year in advance was given. Three more hot meals were presented and given by FA who were proud of their many options. Thus I had cold seafood platter as starter hot salmon as 1st maincourse and as 2nd main course: kofta 3rd main course: pasta and 4th rice with giant prawns. Cheese platter of high quality. Good advice on wines. IST-YYZ-IST on Boeing 777-300. Perfect hardware (inclusive WiFi) and excellent food. However the staff (FAs) has a lot to improve on - Language Socializing Read and understand passengers minds and needs. They need to avoid speaking Turkish to ""all"" passengers and could recruit a bulk of international staff to beef up Spanish Chinese Vietnamese Thai French Arab and …English. The timing of service inputs need improvement. Sense of FA-humour is nil FA's avoidance of passengers is felt -– one could sit on the entire flight without being offered more than 10% of what are available.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,224,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Simple flight to IST and a 6.5 hour wait with little to do. Recommend Cafe Nero for a really good cup of tea while you wait. Flight to Cape Town was reasonably pleasant but staff were a little sniffy especially the females. Food was fair but nothing special. Inflight entertainment was awful. Provided headphones were of the earbud type really uncomfortable and wouldn't stay in the ears. Sound quality was horrible. Return leg was an unsuitable for long haul plane which was full after it stopped in Joburg. The meal on take off was delicious. The staff on the return leg were one of the most hard working I have encountered making up for the poor plane. However the breakfast was served cold and was uneatable. Same meal was served on the IST-LGW leg and we declined it. Security check at IST on the return leg was horrible. One South African woman bleeped while going through the gate and was the subject of what I consider rough and unnecessary treatment.

But it's a clean friendly environment! A340-300 to IST just a few business class passengers. The seats are worn but not worn-out. I preferred a low calorie meal which turned out to be fish. The meal itself was good enough. We landed on time. My flight outbound from IST is always late no matter the weather. Late boarding late departure. My plane was already there!

TK feeder flight late leaving Antalya late arriving IST bus 10 minutes around tarmac as no airbridge! No staff waiting to expedite transfers. I am a regular traveller and always every attempt is made to enable connections. It's basic.

2014-06-05,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,I've flown with Turkish 4 times since Jan 2014. This weekend (29 May to 1st June) I flew with them again from Riyadh to Geneva and return. First flight Wednesday night was crowded but boarding went well and was relatively quick. Onboard the plane was not clean the supposedly red seats were much more black the carpet was dirty and entertainment system outdated. Flight attendants were rude. The food as usual was quite good. Landing at IST was ok. Airport is not the nicest but not bad. Nevertheless I still do not understand why you have again to go for a full security check while in transit. Then we boarded for GVA starting with a bus ride crossing the taxiway and queuing. The plane was again outdated and not clean at all. Again flight attendants were not smiling and the entertainment system did not exist.

2014-06-08,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,We flew from Rome to Istanbul business class staff food and aircraft were excellent no complaints on this 3.5 hour flight. We then had a two hour wait for our flight to Hong Kong in premium economy on Turkish Airlines. Again everything was excellent. Only thing I could say they should get their boarding process more efficient. Everyone was seated near the boarding counter (flight full or nearly full) we had been sitting there for an hour a person came in and told everyone to move we thought the gate had changed. No. We were moved outside the door past another counter and then had to line up show our boarding pass which part was torn off and then had to sit back where we were originally. Sat there for an hour. After all passengers were seated back where they were the staff member then proceeded to zap all the boarding passes it seemed like 6 times. Why I don't know that is usually done in one process. We then lined up in lines marked A B C D and then flew to HKG.

Asked for water as it was peak summer and did not come until the beverages started. The crew were curt. Flight from Istanbul to Sweden was better quality but again food was pathetic. Sweden to Istanbul food was bearable. Istanbul to Delhi - again entertainment was not working. Never again will I take this flight.

Flight attendants were smiling and friendly and did a great job to complete a full service within 2hrs 45 min. Flight left on time arrived on time in IST. Smooth check-in and boarding in Vienna. Transfer at IST airport very easy. Plenty of shops and restaurants the only downside is that there was no airbridge available for the next flight to TLV. No seats available at the departure gate and very cramped. Flight from IST to TLV was excellent. Brand new A321 with personal TV on each seat. Again FA's very friendly and they served a hot meal in the middle of the night (flight was 1 hour 40 min). Return flight from TLV to IST again a very new plane flight left punctual at Ben Gurion airport FA's smiling and friendly all the time. Again a smooth transfer at IST connection to HAM. Older aircraft from IST to HAM but enough legroom even in Y- class. I have no doubt to recommend this airline. Especially the catering and the onboard meals are fresh and tasty from Turkish Do&CO.

2014-06-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,Recently flew Istanbul to New York City in Business Class using United Air Miles. Very comfortable seats which allowed a potential good sleep. Food excellent though it took a long time to serve and we all were anxious to sleep it was evening. There were two problems: the restroom was filthy from the beginning of the flight. Floor was sticky trash overflowed the bins and was on the floor. When I told Flight Attendant I don't believe she really understood. She told me to use the restroom in Business Class but this was in Business Class. Second problem was it seemed families with young children (infants and toddlers) were invited to use Business Class as a free upgrade. This was nice for them but having two screaming youngsters for several hours was hard on the rest of the passengers. Turkish Air has a great reputation so this was a disappointing flight.

Departed on-time. The flight crew were superb attentive and bi- lingual. Great selection of Turkish newspapers including English-language editions. During the over-night flight my wife awoke: A flight crew member immediately came to her to see if there was anything she needed. Food was good as were the entertainment selections. The food and drinks were well presented including “candlelight dinner high above the clouds.” The bathroom was kept clean through-out the flight the fresh flowers inside and immediately outside were an unexpected touch. Only complaint was the lack of expedited customs upon arrival.

2014-06-18,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,Flew TK041 from Johannesburg to Istanbul on 12 June. The flight was full and as a result it was one of the most cramped flights I have experienced. Not for the faint hearted. The major issue is the A330's they use on the route are old and tired. The upholstery was worn through and coming apart from the seats. Very tacky for an airline striving to be one of the world's best. There was minimal leg room in fact on sitting down my legs were already jammed into the seat in front. I don't think I would fly with them again - will probably take the longer route via Dubai. Emirates' seats have far more leg room on the 777's. The service itself was great it was just the planes that were awful!,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,240,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-06-20,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,TK21 PEK to IST. Orderly and on time boarding. Was asked to relocate to a different seat than the one pre- assigned in order to accommodate a passenger with physical disability. Ended up in a window seat as no other aisle seats were available. The Purser tried very hard and apologized profusely. A warm approach I am not used to receiving from TK FA's. Cabin as with many TK flights very warm and air stale. Comfortable lie-flat seats with plush blanket and soft pillow. The shell style seats do not offer much storage room and are narrower than other business class seats. Attentive service throughout the flight with FA's frequently checking on passengers. Good meal and wine selection although main course was somewhat tasteless. AVOD system with 20 inch screens and a wide selection of movie and music options although somewhat dated. The highlight of the flight was the free WiFi which is a very nice touch.

2014-06-20,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,TK 0035 IST Ataturk-Montreal June 17 2014. Booking the flight one month in advance: both my travel agent and I tried to secure an exit row seat. I expected to pay for it. The airline was impossible to reach from Canada. At check-in the seat selected by the travel agent was changed to an unacceptable one. A request to upgrade for business cabin was denied. On the ground at Ataturk a long and very slow line-up in the corridor just to enter the gate (an additional security check - we have gone through the passport control as well as the security already). Not a single seat available. The security agents behaved like Canadian immigration officials interrogating people about purposes of their trips but no information was going into computers. Younger people were sitting on the floor older ones standing there with their bags looked tortured already. The plane was jammed full. The seats in Economy were really cramped no legroom (a 10hr flight). Rude FA's and completely devoid of smiles. Dismissive and unhelpful to boot trying to ignore passengers as much as possible. Dirty lavatories with pileups of used paper towels on top of garbage boxes no toilet seats available.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,242,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-06-20,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,I flew Dublin - Istanbul - Doha - Istanbul - Dublin. Business class seats are very uncomfortable with minimal recline think BA Club Europe. Crew would rather be at home no eye contact or smile. EN Route from IST-DOH I was the only person in business class and had to ask the captain and 2 female flight attendants to lower their voice they were literally shouting and laughing it was a 00.35 departure so I wanted to sleep they did not dim the lighting. On the return leg DOH-IST I managed some sleep but was woken by the inflight chef snoring in the seat next to me. IST-DUB I slept through the meal service when I woke I tried to get some water but no one came from the bell I went to the galley which was deserted. There were two flight attendants serving economy class someone came from economy class after about 10 minutes to help me. There is no priority boarding for business class.

Most recent flight was on 20 June 2014 from Riyadh (KSA) to Paris (France) via Istanbul. Leg 1: TK141 was delayed (as usual). Flew with an old A321. Very tired and dirty. Business class seat was an economy seat. Most of business class passengers complained about the seats (it was an overnight flight and most of us wanted to sleep - but it was impossible). Crew was ok - nothing exceptional (typical TK). Food was average - I am really wondering why they have the-so called ""Flying-Chef"" on board. Leg 2: TK1821 was delayed as well. Flew with a new A330-300 featuring the new business class. Much space and a fully flat bed. Although business class cabin is spacious it is not sophisticated at all. Cabin was dirty.

2014-06-23,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,I had return flight CDG-TBS-CDG via Istanbul by Turkish last month. The service overall was really excellent. The food was very good nicely presented and tasty. Cabin attendants were professional in all flights nothing to complain about. Seats are ok for a couple of hours flights with the overhead screens and consequently limited entertainment. I have three observations for improvement: 1) The Business lounge in Sabina airport is very unpleasant a box size room with no edible food available. 2) The Ataturk airport (I had it for return flight) was extremely busy and flights are usually delayed for 30-45 minutes. 3) I observed that the light in cabins during the boarding catering (almost two hours) and landing was extremely bright (it is annoying when there is late evening or night flight).

2014-06-23,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,Flew from IST to ESB on A321. The Business class configuration is typical of the European short haul flights with the middle seat left empty. Legroom is limited and hardly an improvement over Economy. Aircraft was showing its age and as with all TK flights I have been on the air was stuffy and stale. Flight attendants came across as aloof and did not seem to be interested in engaging with the passengers beyond the most basic requirements of their duties. Good meal service for a short flight. There was moderate turbulence throughout the flight resulting in spilled drinks. The FA's did not bother to clean up the spill on my table even though it was evident at the time they collected the meal service. The crews on TK really need to improve their English skills as their announcements are barely understandable and would represent a real concern in the event of an emergency. As well my experience on all of TK flights leave me questioning the safety culture of the FA's as they tend to ignore basic in-flight safety breaches such as passengers standing up while the aircraft is taxiing and leaving their tables down during takeoff and landings. The flight left late due to congestion at Istanbul airport but was otherwise uneventful. Their domestic service is clearly superior to North American and many European carriers and is certainly good value for money. With some attention to cabin service and improved FA performance this airline can easily maintain its status as Europe's best but has a long way to go to compete with Asian and Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,246,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

The staff friendly and the food delicious.

2014-06-25,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,Flew non-stop Houston to Istanbul in Comfort Economy. I had low expectation however it was a pleasant experience. From check-in to boarding the process was well managed. I was greeted with a smile while boarding and found the Comfort Economy area quite spacious. The seats were 2-3-2 with decent cushioning leg room foot rest and in seat IFE. The seats did not allow reclining for a comfortable sleeping position but let's not forget it was $350 more than basic economy fare. Here is the more pleasant part: the cabin crew were full of smiles and were pleasant. No attitude or doing the passengers a favor type behavior. The food service was good and well portioned. I don't get this much polite and pleasant service in business class of major US carriers! The arrival at IST was timely however we parked at a hard stand.

2014-07-01,Turkish Airlines customer review,3,Travelling from Alanya/Gazipasa to Istanbul via Ankara the first disappointment was that there was no online check-in. At the airport you are allocated a seat which cannot be changed as the system doesn't allow it said the young lady on the desk. No lounge but such a small airport and only one or two flights a day hardly warrant it. In fact the Turkish Airlines printed timetable doesn't even list the flights there. I went into the airport shop for a can of Coke but at TL 7.25 decided it was too much of a rip-off. No priority boarding so a scramble at the gate. Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening. But inside I discovered my next sector was delayed and the Business Class lounge was outside so I could not reach it. Luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding. They made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through. Full flight and had another sandwich and cake. After landing at Istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for 15 minutes before a gate was available. My luggage was the last up - seems they don't use priority tags at Alanya either.

2014-07-13,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,BHX-IST-BKK. July 9 2014. Boeing 737-800: BHX-IST. Very impressed with Turkish Airlines European business class. By far the best of all European carriers for comfort and privacy. It offers a 2-2 configuration with 20' leather recliners with additional foot rest. There is a personal VOD monitor in the arm rest with a wide variety of shows and movies for a 3 hour flight. Flight attendants are very polite and professional. Food catering is of the highest standard to match and surpass other European Carriers like BA KLM or Lufthansa. Airbus A330-300: IST-BKK. The TK business class lounge is very impressive with kids room multiple TV rooms 2 grand pianos and some of the cleanest toilets I have seen at an airport. Lounge provides user friendly lockers to store your belongings. A bit chaotic boarding at IST. The shuttle bus used to take passengers to the aircraft was a bit overcrowded and ground staff seemed a bit disorganised. However after boarding it's all up hill. FAs were very attentive and professional. The personalised chef for the forward cabin was a nice touch. Good selection of food and drinks and the inflight entertainment is more than adequate for the 9 hours and 40 mins. Seats are very comfortable for business class with an exceptional amount of leg room although the seat configuration of 2-2-2 does not provide loads of privacy for a single traveler with the two end seats A and K not giving direct aisle access. Overall Turkish Airlines provides a very good product in business. Will definitely recommend and travel again in the future.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,257,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-07-17,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,"JFK-ATH business class round-trip in June (TK0004 & 0001). Departure from JFK was delayed by almost 3 hours as the pilot could not be found. On arrival in Istanbul we had to go the ""transfer desk"" to find a connection to ATH. Said transfer desk has a queue of over 100 people from every conceivable destination and no priority for business class. End result was that we had to sit for 4 hours in the biz-class lounge and watch 2 codeshares fly out before TK. Yes we missed our connecting flight in ATH as well. Return ATH to IST managed to be 2 hours late as well for a 90 minute morning flight. This time we barely made the JFK connection and our ""priority"" luggage was delivered 2 days later. The good: seats are very comfortable entertainment and Wifi are excellent and the food is really delicious; IST lounge is wonderful. The bad: cabin crew disappears after service and on the return allowed a passenger in an adjoining seat to get utterly smashed as he drank endless full glasses of Scotch until landing. He then proceeded to lie down on the floor for the landing which the crew chose to ignore IST airport is a nightmare.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,258,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-07-29,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,BRU-IST-BRU C cabin - check in is unfortunately a mess no priority check in respected staff not interested don't give a damn attitude. Done by Avia Partner. Had to ask twice for a fast track card for arrivals in IST check in staff did not even know they existed. and they have 4 flights to IST daily. Lounge is always full and dirty and am afraid boarding is always a mess even you are flying c class. From wait in lounge to designated gate to last call all of this in less than 10 minutes simply ridiculous. Experienced this many time. Once on board all is different - friendly yet professionals staff with lack of language skills but ok on security and service. Some try to go the extra mile. Only option to IST direct. They need to improve ground staff and boarding skills and attitudes otherwise I would perhaps recommend. IST lounge on Sunday 27/07/14 announcement from no info to go to gate to last call gate closed 15 mins. Too many flights too little doors even if they are remote they have lost it - they need a third airport. However IST lounge is the best in Europe perhaps only competing with BA in T5 in Heathrow.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,260,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Mostly I enjoy excellent flights. Luggage is rarely lost. Out of 100+ flights it happened once which was likely due to a non-Turkish Airlines connection. Food is halal and of top quality. Most of the fleet is brand new. Once in a while you get an old one which makes the flight experience mediocre. The miles program is great but they started reducing the number of miles that can be earned. One thing annoying is the in-flight announcement.

2014-08-08,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,TK12 and TK571 JFK-IST-JRO departing July 3rd 2014. Had multiple terrible experiences with TK in the last year the most recent of them in July 2014 on the first flight of our honeymoon! Every time I have flown with TK from JFK or BRU the flight was late by more than 90min without any explanation. Leading to a missed connection and being stranded against our will in Istanbul. Each time the in-flight crew assured us the connecting flight would be informed and wait for us. Each time there was no one upon landing to direct us and help us find our connection gate. Each time we missed the connecting by less than 10min after desperately running across the airport to try and make it. Each time the ground staff for luggage collection and transfer/hotel arrangements were unduly rude and totally unhelpful. And the hotel provided for the night was very sub-standard. And each time we had to pay an entry visa that we would otherwise not have had to pay. I have flown a lot of different airlines and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. In the latest occurrence they would not even make a nice gesture to acknowledge the fact they were ruining the first 2 days of our honeymoon. Needless to say we will never fly Turkish airlines again if we can avoid it.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,266,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

The toilet was not clean and smelt very bad not hygenic for children to use. The food was not good for children. The was no provisions for children to play with.

2014-08-08,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,Travel agent booked me on a Malaysia Airlines flight which was code shared with Turkish airlines Turkish for first leg from Istanbul to KL then Malaysian from KL to Sydney. Boarded in Istanbul and the check-in staff couldn't have been less helpful. The first person at the check-in counter passed me off onto someone else because of what she called a 'ticket problem' before promptly going on her break. The second person was slightly more helpful up until the point someone came around and told him to go on a break. Then it became too hard to do anything more than check me in onto the Turkish airlines flight. He wouldn't check my bag through to Sydney no real reason given but from previous experience it is possible to check bags through despite different airlines in operation. This meant that once I arrived in KL I had to clear customs pick up my bag and then check back in again. A massive pain and something that wouldn't have been achievable if I had had less than 3 hours between flights.

Headset cable was broken only one side could be heard. Way back it was worse: Checked in but was not offered an invitation to the lounge so I had to bribe someone to get me that instead of again going through security. Then 75 min departure delay without any notice information etc. which made me miss my connection in Istanbul. The onboard entertainment system was completely off apologies for the technical defect. Not to mention the USB plug for charging the phone. After the 7hr night flight no breakfast or simply a coffee was offered.

While the flights we've had over the years have been good in terms of food price in-flight service and entertainment etc today was quite the opposite. My wife and kids flew to Istanbul from Macedonia intending to get on a flight to Chicago. Instead they were told at the gate that the boarding passes they had received for the flight were not adequate and there were no seats for them. They were turned away and sent to a ""help desk"" that was a nightmare. It took hours to rebook them on tomorrow's flight and they were denied hotel accommodation even though it was the airline's fault.

Check in staff at Dar Es Saleem seemed clueless about how to sort problems re prospect of missed connections. Eventually assured us that we were booked on later 19.10 hours flight to Heathrow and gave assurances our luggage would be transferred. On arrival at Istanbul received the worst customer service experience. Staff rude unhelpful and incompetent. No bookings for onward flight found initially told we would have to overnight in Istanbul only after continued insistence with staff were seats found for us. On boarding flight TK1983 we found over 30 empty seats on the aircraft we were told there were no seats available.

The food and drinks offered were high quality and plentiful except my fish entree was over cooked. The service was awkward. It was a full hour after takeoff before the in flight service was started. Food was prepared in the forward galley and plated in the rear galley which meant there was constant cabin staff traffic between the two galleys making the cabin environment frenetic. Beverages were only offered once at the beginning of the meal service.

Flight to North Cyprus B737-800 seat ok food surprisingly served on an hour flight entertainment system not fantastic. Flight from Istanbul to LHR was just fantastic mainly because of the Turkish business lounge which is as far as I am concerned is the best of the best. Food space comfort facilities all there in this brand new lounge all excellent. Flight on B737-800. Aircraft type changed at the last minute so passengers seated all over the place. Everyone seemed civilised onboard and just swapped seats onboard so couples could sit together. Chef onboard and food prepared by DoCo just sumptuous. Cabin crew all male in business were terrific.

2014-08-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,TK 2421 Antalya to Istanbul August 11. TK 66 Istanbul to Jakarta August 12. We have always enjoyed TK and have flown it many places around the world each time in Business Class. There does seem to be a difference in both the service and attitude on the 330 vs 777 airplanes. The 777 FA's are more caring and do not disappear after service. After numerous long haul flights is seems that the FA's on the 330 are less trained and really do not care. Yesterday on the Istanbul to Singapore flight a FA attendant was smashing the pillows and blankets into the overhead compartments even if they were full of luggage. It was a disaster trying to get the hand carry out of the overhead because of all the bedding. Another thing is the food. When a flight leaves Istanbul at 1 am on a 10 hour flight the most important meal is breakfast not dinner. We have yet to have an edible breakfast even in Business Class. The eggs are a messy runny non-recognizable mess or there was some mystery Turkish pastry breakfast that was like rubber. You would think that with nobody eating the entrée that they would stop serving it. The funny thing is that the meals served in the European Business Class are quite good. The Business Class lounge in Istanbul remains the best in the world. We love spending time there. Unfortunately they boast if having thousands of flights daily but the airport in Istanbul cannot handle nearly as many as they want to fly. The taxi ways and concourses are a disaster. You would think there would be separate lines for Business and Economy like the rest of the airlines in the world but no. We will continue to fly Turkish Airlines because we feel safe and the price is right. Occasionally we get a good flight crew. But it is all hit and miss. The one consistent thing about Turkish Airline is that you cannot apply one word or phrase to describe them because they always are different.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,281,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-08-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,BUD-IST-KIX (Istanbul-Osaka) and return. Short range A320 and B737-800 were a bit tighter seated but the A332 on IST-KIX and back was very spacious. We took row 32 or so (do your online check-in 24 hrs in advance) where config is only 2x3x2 - legroom was great. Seat comfort for my 90 kgs also acceptable but a bit high armrests. Food was plentiful and excellent in quality with metal cutlery (long gone since the '90-s from most fights unfortunately) even trilingual menu cards were provided on all legs with 2 choices on the long range ones. Both long ranges being (mostly) night fights cabin attendants got all window blinds closed after service so all pax could sleep rather well - even on the backwards leg where plane was 90% loaded. Cabin crew were very attentive and thorough - what I rate the most is that they checked all seat belts and seat tray window blind etc. before landing and got everything arranged right. Toilets were kept clean in the aft cabin all the way through free beverages and snack stocks were kept available constantly. Inflight entertainment runs (obviously) on some Android old op.sys tablets integrated into seat backs and mine was stuck somehow though but did not ask for assistance.

2014-08-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,Flew Nairobi-IST-Boston return. While aircraft and cabin were fine food definitely above average and a bird strike was professionally and safely handled by the pilot (take off aborted switch to new aircraft) I was not happy with the following: 1) Very difficult to get hold of Turkish Airlines office by phone. I wanted to inquire about changes to my ticket. In Nairobi I had to end up making the journey to their downtown office in person because no one answered the phone. In the US it was equally difficult to get hold of anyone who could help with ticket changes. You can also only pay any change fees in person at the airport (this alone took an hour prior to the actual check in and ended up being USD 80 higher than originally advised). In Boston there is also no on- line check in available. Turkish is just not equipped with the kind of services that makes this much easier with airlines like KLM BA Delta etc. 2) Horrible experience at Istanbul airport. Again wanted to go to a ticket office to inquire about changes during my layover. In the entire international transit area there is none! It was also incredibly difficult just to find someone who spoke adequate English! After going in circles I was finally told I need to get a visa exit the airport go to the ticket office outside then re-enter! It was also by far the dirtiest airport I have been to hardly saw cleaning crews and if I did they were standing around talking rather than working. Neither ground staff nor cabin crew particularly friendly on a four leg trip one flight attendant stood out for trying to be particularly helpful. I had chosen Turkish because at the time it was the cheapest option the few hundred dollars saved were not worth it because of the other hassles gained. The early morning departure and arrival times in Nairobi also make an already long trip even more painful.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,283,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

They offer a choice of meals but do carry enough of the options to provide choice to all. On this occasion they had given all the meals out of my preferred option after only 4 or 5 rows of passengers. They did not offer any option.

TK are superb and in many ways in a different league when it comes to their food. Every meal I ate everything something which happens rarely for me. The entertainment system is excellent and the FAs are good. The only negative thing is information flow; their IT systems and definitely not up-to-date and it was very frustrating flying OSL-IST not knowing if we would make the PEK flight.

Crammed us to the bus while some passengers did not have a seat and there was not enough luggage space. On August 23 they told us the flight will leave at 6 pm. After we got back to the terminal at 3 o’clock the flight was delayed again with no clear reason given. We were waiting not knowing if we are actually going to fly. While complaining to them they would respond that there was going to be somebody at Istanbul airport waiting for us to take care of all complaints but when we arrived in Istanbul we could not find anybody. When calling the airline regarding the issue the representatives would say“our system shows that there was no flight cancellation on August 22”and we had to convince them that the flight was actually cancelled and there were hundreds of people on that flight and some missed the collecting flights and hotel reservations. On my way back to Boston although I purchased my ticket 5 months earlier they changed my status to Standby without notifying me and I had to wait until all the passengers get on board and hope for open seat. This was the worst travel experience I have had I would not travel with them again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,292,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-09-06,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,"LAX-IST-DNZ-IST-LAX. Another wonderful journey with TK. The food continues to be astounding and the service level is excellent. At first I thought the ""candlelight"" service using small battery powered flickering candles on the tray was a bit hokey. But is produces a very nice effect and my seatmate asked if he could have mine as he uses them on his boat. The difference between US carriers and TK is especially evident on the short flights were a full hot breakfast was served and the seat had multiple adjustments for comfort-far from the US offerings in F domestically. And the Istanbul lounge continues to be a delight.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,293,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-09-06,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,My wife and I were booked on TK961 Kyrenia (Ercan)/Istanbul connection to TK1969 Istanbul/Birmingham UK 1st September. Checked in at Ercan baggage through to UK but no boarding/seating passes for Istanbul to Birmingham provided which we thought rather odd so had to go via Transit in Istanbul Airport. First flight delayed a little but as already booked in we assumed that Transit would have seats ready for us. Oh no given standby seat/pass ran to departure gate sent to aircraft only one seat (we heard staff had been given the seats available). Sent back to another Transit desk from there to the original one where we were re-booked for the next day fortunately checked in and boarding passes printed for us. 4 hours in airport at Istanbul (not a nice experience) before eventually got to hotel. Next day transfer from hotel was late arriving at hotel and little real expectancy of being on flight let alone where the luggage might be also found other UK passengers in same position. Through all check in etc to boarding gate chaos. Why say area A B C etc if not using it. Mad queue load of young kids and parents. On board kids seemed to go to wherever they wanted as did many adults. We got our seats Ok and stayed put. Nightmare for crew many passengers simply refusing to move to allocated seat even though plane was full. I cannot imagine a less organised operation and it seemed this was a regular occurrence and indeed whilst waiting in boarding queue met other UK passengers who had been given STBY cards even though they were at airport very early and had booked several months earlier - it seems the practice to overbook then bump off UK passengers. We will never again use them.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,294,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-09-10,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,Traveling from St Petersburg to Istanbul in business class - very disappointed the business class on this ageing 757-800 was no better than economy class. The seats were economy did not recline more than 15 degrees. The centre seat of an economy row was made inactive by folding it down. Hence calling the two seat arrangement business class. Extra leg room was there but was of no use as the footrest was fixed. How can they be called the best airline in Europe when they do not provide the basic requirement for a business class seat.

2014-09-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,"Travelled VIE-IST-JFK-IST-Vie at the end of July. We booked Premium Economy with TK to N.Y. for a family trip as TK offers best value in this class (only slightly more expensive than the cramped Y-class on any direct flight from Vienna to N.Y. in peak season unfortunately there is no Premium-Y ex Vienna). 3 days befor departure we received note from TK that due to an aircraft switch ""Comfort Class"" (only on TK's 777) would not be available on the 10-hour flight from IST to JFK thus we were offered a later flight. I requested an update to C-class instead which was duly granted - a great move from TK and just what I expected from ""Europe's best airline""! Our 2-hour morning flight to IST in Y-class was comfortable sufficient legroom menu cards were distributed and a hot and tasty breakfast was served (fantastic service having in mind what other airlines consider as catering). Our connecting flight was in C-class so we enjoyed the marvellous TK lounge at IST airport that streches over 5000 square metres on two levels - try the freshly brewed Turkish Coffee! The flight to JFK on an Airbus A-330 in business class was as comfortable as it can get (welcome drink fluffy duvets flat beds Do&Co flying cooks meal courses were served one after the other as it should be dedicated and smiling FAs a wide range of movies). Bottomline: we arrived relaxed and happy. Only a minor point: cabin design could be slightly more colourful. Unfortunately our flight back to Vienna via IST was not upgraded so we travelled in ""Comfort Class"" as planned. Seats are in CC are wide and legroom is plenty. There were no welcome drinks and meal service started way behind C-Class (keep in mind that the flight departed at midnight!) but the meals dinner and a full hot breakfast before landing all served on china were tasty and satisfying. The amenity bag distributed in ""Comfort Class"" wasn't Porsche-design like in business but nevertheless came in very handy. At IST we spent some time at the ""Prime Class Lounge"" (we pre-booked this service before we departed) where you can take a relaxing shower after a long-distance flight. The final leg of our journey took us back to Vienna in Y-class in the late afternoon. Again menu cards with an extra drink/wine-list were distributed prior to dinner service once again an amazing service by TK considering the occasional sachet of pretzels - it at all! - other airlines serve on 2 hour flights. Final verdict: I wholeheartedly recommend Turkish!",Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,yes,299,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-09-17,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,"My husband and I took four economy flights in the last couple of weeks between London and Antalya via Istanbul. We chose Turkish Airlines over the lower cost carriers as it has won several awards and had better arrival times than Easyjet etc. Check in at LHR was chaotic and staff were disinterested and inefficient. The flight was delayed. In fact all four flights were delayed. We were unable to book legroom seats on the first flight (my husband is 6'6"") but were able to move once the flight was underway. As we were going through the gate for the second flight the staff grabbed my boarding pass took a pen and scrubbed out my seat number and changed it. When I asked why (no explanation was volunteered) I was told the plane had changed. On boarding I was in an entirely different part of the plane to my husband in between members of a young family despite there being spaces next to my husband. Needless to say I moved once the flight was underway. No apologies from staff. On arrival international passengers were separated from domestic and taken to the international terminal to receive our suitcases. After waiting for a long time (late in the evening) someone eventually came and told us we had been sent to the wrong terminal. No apologies. No directions as to how to get into the arrivals hall of the domestic terminal. Eventually found it - everyone else from the flight were long gone. On arrival at Antalya airport 2 weeks later to take our two flights home check in again was chaotic. Asked for legroom seats - we're given them for the first flight but not the second. No explanation or apology. Legroom was non existent - even I struggled to fit. My husband found it impossible. We asked if it was possible to move and we're told no - no explanations or apologies. Again others were seated separately and there were a couple of heated conversations which the staff dealt with very poorly. Once the flight was underway and the seatbelt signs were off my husband stood up finding a spot out of everyone's way. The person in front reclined their seat making it impossible to sit back down when told to do so. My husband explained this politely to a very abrupt attendant and was told in no uncertain terms to sit. No care understanding or apologies. I pleaded with the guy in front to put his seat upright and my husband retook his seat. His knees were up against the seat in front and the magazine rack cut into his shins. Food dreadful. Seatbelt signs kept on for most of flight and flight attendants almost invisible for the rest of the journey.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,300,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-09-17,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,Flew biz class for the first time and it is not what it is hyped up to be. 1) Wifi network did not work. 2) Service and food quality was poor. Breakfast was staggered as there was a flying chef who prepares personalized meals according to a menu that you order off in advance - this works in theory not in practice. On my long haul outbound they forgot some ordered items on my way back they lost my menu card all together. Therefore it was only after the passenger next to me finished his breakfast that they even bothered to ask if I wanted to eat anything. They only refill drinks ie coffee upon request. My breakfast of scrambled eggs was extremely watery and undercooked. 3) Seat configuration: A strange 2x3x2 configuration. On my flight out I was in a window seat and did not notice but on the flight back in seat 2E (center seat) realized that one could feel every footstep of people striding by. 4) Toiletries: On my flight back they forgot to give me my toiletry bag I had to ask for it. 5) Fast track service: Depends on airport I guess but at Istanbul the fast track immigration line was not much shorter vs the normal lines. I only flew this airline due to the convenience of transit to my final destination (Tbilisi).,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,301,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-09-17,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,Milan-Istanbul-Sao Paulo. Milan-Istanbul: quite old Airbus A320 with limited entertainment onboard. As usual excellent hot meal distributed. Very nice and efficient cabin crew. Long transfer at IST Ataturk Airport. For such a reason Turkish paid a very nice hotel for me (5 stars) located in the city center. Free transfers also provided both ways. Istanbul-Sao Paulo: 13 hours daily flight aboard a new 773-full flight. I got the emergency exit which means a lot of space for a better rest. The 3-3-3 seat configuration in Economy is extremely appreciated and TK is one of the few airlines world-wide which still keeps it nowadays. Very young and pleasant cabin crew. Meals: overall two hot meals - tasty and well-presented. IFE completed with a wide range of movies and TV programs. Live TV and free-wifi onboard definitely a plus.

The 2nd leg had the pods which I actually found slightly less comfortable. The service was great except for one thing on my Montreal flight when I had to ask 3 times for some water.

2014-09-24,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,"I read some variable reviews before booking my flights from NJ to Istanbul so decided against direct flight and booked United to Munich then TA to Istanbul then TA back to Frankfurt and Lufthansa back to NJ. TA was by far the best parts of the trip with over-the-top service plenty of stretch room in business class (I'm 6'1"") and solid quality food. I liked the repeated options to grab another croissant / roll or requests whether I wanted a refill of wine or coffee. The Airbus A330s I flew were new and immaculate. My only complaint was the boarding process which wasn't well organized in Munich at all with a long narrow gate where everyone across all classes congregated and blocked any chance for an organized boarding. Had I not been near the front I would have been one of the last to board despite my business class seat and never heard a call for that class to board. The return trip was a bit better with the gate agent asking out loud - not over the PA - whether anyone was in business class and directed us to a separate line that was initially hidden from view. I would definitely recommend TA to other passengers traveling in business class and would take fly with them again if given the option.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,304,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-10-05,Turkish Airlines customer review,3,IST-VCE-IST - Boarded pretty much on time but departed Istanbul 1 hour late with the aircraft sitting on the tarmac with Ataturk airport almost always congested that's nothing new. Cabin very hot and stuffy until the end of the flight. Of course no beverage service until 40 minutes into the flight. 737-900ER which looked brand new cabin very clean nice looking seats but with typical THY pitch so not much space to move. Reclining button missing/broken so impossible to move the backrest. Nice choice of movies on the IFE and big screen when the thing worked the whole system rebooted on all seats after a while and my lucky colleague next to me has his rebooted a dozen times or more until the flight attendant attempted to fix it by rebooting it a few more times and then gave up. Service as usual with THY OK if you don't expect too much the only friendly and smiling stewardess was the one who did not speak any English. Return flight on A321-200 departed on time from VCE and full almost to the last seat. Good for them. Slow food service with only 2 stewards each with one trolley and that took ages mine ran out of beef kebab after the 10th row. The 2 of us had beef served cold and mine was some köfte dish which was not even on the menu. I guess it was some leftover from a previous flight and re-heated twice the lid was already open and it was stone cold. My colleague had the time to finish watching his movie from the previous flight and arrival was on time in IST. Every time I am stuck with flying Turkish I wonder how they manage to get Europe's best airline award and now for the 3rd year.

Flight was packed from Beirut to Istanbul operated by an old A321 with no personal TV. To be honest one of the things that was brought to my attention the carelessness of the cabin crew in checking seat belts and providing the appropriate safety demonstrations no announcement was made from the captain at all during the whole flight. Nevertheless once we got to Istanbul I nearly made my connecting flight to LHR. Again flight was operated by an A321 with no ptv which I found very surprising. Again service was not great however they served good food. Overall would not fly again with them due to their very tired aircraft's being used on the route and due to the service of both the cabin crew and the hassle for connecting passengers in Istanbul.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,311,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-10-15,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,BRU-IST-BRU c class - rather smooth check in BRU. Used fast track and lounge. TK uses SN lounge in Brussels which is always too crowded understaffed and unclean with little food choices. Especially if you bear in mind 2 UA flights 1 AC and one Hainan plus all of El Al and Turkish and all of SN and other Star Alliance flights all sharing this non Schengen lounge at the same time! Too vile and disgusting. No Senator members lounge at all! Even Vienna has got one. Boarding was the usual TK mess but must say flight ok A320 excellent configuration and experienced staff. Expecting an A330 as earlier planned but change of plane (must say not enough pax). Arrival in IST using fast track arrivals plus optional lounge in IST a breeze. Return again smooth check in Istanbul plus fast track plus lounge a breeze and absolutely exquisite for a business class lounge! Now boarding was the usual TK mess remote gate and all that jazz on board crew too busy arguing about something or other and service was dull and boring but efficiently done! disembark ok no fast track no need really in BRU and suitcase one of the first out! good.

2014-10-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,My recent flight on Turkish Airlines was with mixed emotion. Inflight service was excellent. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Athens with one stop in Istanbul. The flight from Dubai to Istanbul was 40 minutes late and we missed the flight from Istanbul to Athens by 5 minutes. One would think that since it is the same airline and they knew their flight was late which contained passengers going onto a connecting flight to hold the flight for 5 minutes and also have staff waiting at the exit gate of the first flight to express process passengers in order to make the second flight. I was traveling with my pregnant wife and we had to wait another 5 hours for the next flight. Two other couples were not so lucky as they had a connecting flight to Skopje and they had to wait until the next day. They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport. One of the couples had a baby who would've been about a year old. We were compensated with a measly food voucher worth no more then 4 Euros each. There was a huge line at the flight services counter with many people experiencing the same issue with connecting flights. It seems they have not got the hang of how connecting flights should work and the gap between the flight times.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,316,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I am frequent traveler and I always prefer to travel with Lufthansa and Turkish airlines especially in economy so I recommend it to everyone.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,325,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-10-31,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,Avoid this airline and avoid any transit through Istanbul. Recently flew with Turkish Airlines LHR-IST-TLV-IST- LHR. Cabin crew are cold unfriendly and indifferent to passengers. I was on a scheduled connection home from TLV via Istanbul with a one hour connection time. By the time the aircraft parked offloaded passengers and we cleared security in the transfer lounge I arrived at the gate 10 min before he next departure time only to be told that the flight had closed and I couldn't board. I was given a seat on the next flight home to London (1 hour 40 mins later) only to arrive in LHR with no luggage! Turkish Airlines is chaotic and so is Istanbul airport.

2014-11-06,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,We flew Frankfurt-Istanbul-Nevsehir return in Oct 2014. First legs were in time flight Cappadocia-IST started half an hour later arrival IST-FRA was 2 hours late. It would have been nice if they had offered water to the people who were boarded half an hour after the flight schedule time and had to wait on the plane another hour till the doors were closed. During the flight beverages were generously offered food (2 choices) was very pleasant. Cabin well cleaned and staff friendly. Only thing we did not enjoy was the entertainment. Program in general very mainstream few interesting movies. No German films not a single film with German audio or subtitles. Original English or American films hard to understand because of cheap earphones. English subtitles would have helped very much but there were none.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,331,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-12-01,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,I flew business Dublin to Bangkok via Istanbul. First leg of the trip was ok on par with premium economy but no business class. The leg from Istanbul to Bangkok was the worst flight I have had. We arrived late into Istanbul from Dublin and were running late to catch the connecting flight aircrew told us that ground staff were waiting to escort us once we had disembarked well once we had been dumped by the bus at the terminal gate there was no staff to help just the usual mess in Istanbul. We eventually found our gate which lucky for us was running late. So as business class we had priority boarding but in reality this was only onto to the bus which then with everyone else on the flight dumped us in the pouring rain at the rear of the aircraft and we had had to fight our way through to our seats at the front. We took our seats and after some time were offered some water or juice – same as economy. There were 5 airline staff looking after a full business class plus the 2 chefs. The service offered did not reflect. About half an hour after take off face wipes were offered however mine was cold and smelt -–not offered a replacement. We were offered a drink I chose champagne which when arrived hardly wet the glass with the quantity given and was warm. A short time later the meal was served which was ok and edible. I managed to get 2 glasses of wine from the crew during the meal. Crew were in a hurry to get your trays packed away and 2.5 hours into the flight all alcohol was locked away and never seen again. Crew took themselves of to hide behind their curtains and not to be seen until 2 hours before we landed when a miserable breakfast was served which I had not ordered. There was 1 business class toilet to service the crew and passengers and the crew seemed to have it in use 80% of the time in the last hour when most passengers were also trying to use it. There were no amenities in the toilet hard paper towels no small cups sink was filthy floor wet. Finally after disembarking in Bangkok getting through customs etc quickly through to the baggage carousel I expected that our bags would be out quickly as we had priority baggage no they came out last and after just about every one else had left the Airport. I have flown Turkish economy before and have found them to be very good and thought that business class would be good but it was awful.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,333,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-12-01,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,Flew IAD-AMM and return from Malta to IAD in November. Flew Business Class round trip. Can't say enough good about the flights as everything from check in to landing went on-time smooth with excellent service both on the ground and in-flight. Considering that I saved over $1000 per person on this routing compared to BA LH and any of the domestic carriers - their in-flight service was far superior to the other transatlantic carriers I've flown over the past 25+ years. Would compare their service to Cathay Pacific. The meal service was outstanding. I've never had meals of this quality before on any airline in First or Business Class. You have to experience it to believe it. Great value for the price I paid and the wonderful service received. Any future business I have going that way - I'm sure to fly Turkish again.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,334,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2014-12-04,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,TK60 from IST to KUL in economy. Food and beverage service was as good as the food itself definitely 4-star standard. However the crew had a new trick which I have not seen before: One of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use. It was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it. Reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea. To add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage. Wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response. I recommend taking rubber boots on your next TK flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,335,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2014-12-10,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,Brussels to Istanbul. The plane was clean and smart and the staff were helpful and well turned out. Standards of English from staff were also very good. The food was very tasty. The inflight entertainment didn't appear to work in any seat on the inward flight though it was good on the outward flight with a decent choice of movies and TV shows.

2014-12-10,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,Turkish Airlines staff are normally brusque and indifferent but when one of their flights is delayed they really excel themselves in terms of inscrutable disdain. Firstly TK0805 to Istanbul (5/11/14) the cabin crew didn't seem to think anyone had the right to know whether we were going or not. When we finally took off over an hour late they were affronted that passengers might want to know if we were going to meet the connecting Turkish flight to London. So not having an answer and not seeming to care they just blithely said 'yes it'll be held'. Everyone rushed to the gate. Low and behold it wasn't held. Sent from pillar to post to interact with various other stony-faced employees who frankly don't care. Not a single person ventured an apology.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,338,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Upon arrival at IST I was sent to a hotel for the night as I had missed my connecting flight to Helsinki. I was re booked onto the flight the following morning. I arrived in Helsinki 19 hours late. Overall I found the food and aircraft its self to be good but the organisation and quality of the people working for Turkish airlines to be very poor.

Food on the flight was abundant and of a very good quality. Staff were attentive and helpful throughout the whole flight. Inflight entertainment was varied with pretty good choices. Seat was ok but after a 14 hour flight everything seems a little uncomfortable I guess.

The not so good safety Video was inaudible no demonstration by staff in the aisles. Features of the seats not pointed out. Hot clothes handed out after the first serving of the meal. Arrived with trays before putting out tables and not at all pleased when I was unable to pull the tray up. No inflight entertainment on the flights Edinburgh to Istanbul and back.

I was given emergency exit seat - being 6 foot 6 inches tall it was highly appreciated. The drink selection and quality of food is good - the best I have had on an airline. The plane was clean and bathrooms were well maintained. The service even in economy was of good quality and crew are professional and friendly. I will fly with Turkish again.

The ambience and general service on board was genuine and of high standard without being too pompous as with most premium products.

2015-01-11,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,IST-BKK a flight we were looking forward to but which disappointed. Our domestic connection was very late but we were given no help at all at Ataturk to transfer to the international terminal in fact an airport staff member tried to prevent us taking the fast route through. The Bangkok flight was listed as only 10 minutes behind schedule so we did not get to the reportedly wonderful lounge but stood in line to board and waited and waited. Flight eventually took off nearly two hours late. Priority boarding OK and a very helpful ground staff who checked that our baggage had been safely transferred. Clean and comfortable Business cabin A330 300 with flat beds and 2x2x2 configuration. Full cabin tiny loos. We sat at the gate for more than an hour with no explanation or apology from the flight deck and took off just before 10pm. Cold drinks before take off champagne after take off dry tepid towel offered. The meal was good but not fantastic and each course took so long to come. Not to use trolleys in a full cabin may look good but slows things down so much. No proper wine glasses we were given our second requested glass of champagne in a large water tumbler! This lack of style and training was obvious at all times. FAs were friendly and obliging but not confident or capable as on many other premium airlines. One had so little English she could not understand us or we her. Good choice of entertainment but the amenities bag was awful. Posh bag very little inside no face cream and the slippers had been used and recycled. Poor storage and FAs had no idea what to do with pillows and duvets once passenger luggage was in the racks. Completed breakfast orders were not collected but we handed ours over. The hot part of breakfast was worse than any premium cabin we've flown in: flabby white toast inedible unseasoned eggs. No announcement from the flight deck about our lateness of arrival or apology/explanation of why. No local time check either and when we asked a FA he got it wrong by an hour!

The plane made a stop in Singapore. IST-TLV-IST on a smaller 319 without IFE service is ok. IST-AMS on a old very small B737 here the seats felt cramped.

2015-01-14,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,I'm amazed that a 737-800 can fly 6 hours and 20 minutes which is how long this flight from Istanbul to Nairobi was. Who knew! This is a brand new 737 with a 2-2 business class configuration. Not flat beds though just recliner business class seats. Which for such a long flight is a bit of an inconvenience especially given the tix price. Love having the cook on board. From Turkish delight which is served to you at the very beginning of the flight to your meals ending with strong Turkish coffee the culinary experience is outstanding. Service was a bit distracted. They forgot the menu. They forgot the toiletry bag. The lights were never really dimmed off on this overnight flight. But ok it happens some times. This is a great plane for continental flights but am not convinced it works for 6+ hour overnight flights.

2015-01-19,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,Flew JFK-MAN in late December after reading recent reviews I was very hesitant about choosing Turkish. They were the cheapest legacy airlines on this route besides the slight detour to Turkey I thought no problem. Being star gold check in at JFK was easy with no waiting was informed at check in that flight was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of previous flight. I had a 2 hour connection in Istanbul asked the check in lady whether it'll be a problem she said no problem plenty of time. Went into Lufthansa lounge as it was the better option of lounges very good quality food/drinks and very quiet. Only problem was no monitors for boarding I proceeded to boarding gate at the time on the boarding pass and there was a was slight delay. Ended boarded first aircraft was clean and in good condition A330-300. Sat in the first section of economy in window finally departed 2hours late due to traffic at JFK knew I'd be pretty lucky to make my next flight. In-flight service was great food good quality and plenty of drinks frequently. Only part I could fault was the size of the offerings was on the small side besides that FA where attentive and helped passengers in every way. I found the onboard chef a bit of a laugh with his hat and outfit but it is a good look and it's a unique product in the industry. I asked one flight attendant what was to happen with my connection when I arrived - no help just said plenty of flights to MAN daily. Arrival into IST was when my next flight was boarding I thought I might have a slight chance if gates were close arrived to a remote stand and we were bussed in. No one was there to help connecting passengers everyone had no idea where to go I eventually found the transfer desk. Was put on a flight 5 hours later no food vouchers offered or compensation or an apology. I used the 'amazing lounge' which would be great with about 50% less people the lounge was packed it was struggle to find a table or chairs. I tired to get some sleep somewhere but was unable to. Asked to use shower but there was a 4 hour wait I said ok because I had five hours got given a buzzer and waited. Finally boarded MAN flight A320 it was uneventful good in-flight entertainment staff were good but less happy than previous leg. Turkish Airlines in-flight product is very good but they really need to work on ground staff and transfers at IST after that flight I said never again purely because of the transfer.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,361,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-01-19,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,Our flight out of Gatwick was delayed several hours and we were offered no explanation as to why. Some passengers said it was because Turkish Airlines had made errors with the seating numbers. The flight itself was fine but on landing in Istanbul we had already missed our onward connection to Bangkok because of the first delay. Turkish Airlines staff in Istanbul were rude not interested tutted and walked away from people who had been queuing for ages to be seen they left me and my family including my small son waiting around for 3 hours before we were told we'd have to be put up in a hotel for the night and they couldn't get us on another flight for 24 hours. We had to buy Turkish visa's to get out of the airport which we were assured would be refunded the next day this was a lie as we were told the next day that they don't do that.

2015-01-21,Turkish Airlines customer review,7,Travelled return trip from Montreal to Tehran with family. Had $600 deal which was great. Impressed with the number of hand outs. They hand out a bag full of slippers eye and ear covers toothbrush. They take care of kids very well too. Montreal to Istanbul flight was a newer plane. They are also not picky about a kilo or two overweight which is great. Per pay lounge in Istanbul is free for kids. For $21 you and your children can spend 6 hrs in an all you can eat snack lounge take a shower and recharge. The negatives were: They put me my wife and 3 yr old and 6 yr old daughters in completely separate seats in different rows for the 2nd leg. Istanbul airport is simply not large enough or updated enough to transit the volume of passenger its doing. I found the airport staff rude and unhelpful on a couple of occasions. I would still fly Turkish for flights that aren't via Istanbul.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,364,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-01-21,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,We found it unacceptable being placed in a side room being used to re- charge batteries for electric vehicles! A large group of disabled passengers were left in this dreadful room. Only seating was non upholstered dropdown metal seats with a narrow gap between them. There was inadequate space to pass resulting in feet being stood on and legs being banged every time someone needed to pass. When we arrived in Manchester staff had forgotten to request wheelchairs. In all made to feel like third class citizens. Don't accept disabled passengers if you don't want to look after them. There was very little help for us on this airline.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,365,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-01-23,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,I flew business class from Istanbul to Los Angeles my seat was 1D. This was flight TK 9. The flight was January 16 2015. It was wonderful service the best I have ever had. The food was good and served in a nice preparation. The Chef is outfitted in a nice chef outfit and gives you the impression you are in a restaurant. The menu choices were broad and adequate. We had a nice trolley of appetizers salads main dish then the deserts. Good quality and plenty of choices. I like when they offer to make up your bed. The flight attendants are attentive and are always picking up after the passengers. The movie selections were good. Always nice to have free Wi-FI. Turkish airlines have way more comfortable seats than some o the other carriers like British Airlines. I will fly them again.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,366,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-01-23,Turkish Airlines customer review,3,Flew A321 Business class IST-LHR. Seating was economy seating that was very hard. The food and service in the cabin was excellent but was let down by the physical cabin environment. Turkish Airlines should really think hard about assigning these aircraft on flights of 4 hours. The seats are not business class and are quite uncomfortable. For the duration of the flight I sat on the pillow. Additionally there was no inflight entertainment. Turkish Airlines can do better than this. I will think carefully before choosing Business Class again on this airline if this type of aircraft is assigned.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,367,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-01-23,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,Flew LHR-IST on 737-800 Business Class. Inflight Entertainment was OK. Seat comfort was not great and the recline angle very small on this aircraft. For a business class seat it hardly reclines to a comfortable angle for resting. I think Turkish Airlines need to reconsider their business class product on medium hall routes as their long haul business class is excellent. This was rather unsatisfactory.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,368,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2015-01-26,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,I flew Economy from Istanbul to Lahore. My flight was delayed in Istanbul by 6.5 hours but no one informed us until twenty minutes after the flight was supposed to depart. Even then we had to look at the screens to tell us. Never did an airport representative bother telling us what was happening. We spent two hours walking around the airport like sheep trying to find a single dinner voucher due to the airport staffs incompetence and indifference. Every single staff member in the airport was rude and disrespectful. The one dinner we were offered was a chicken dish that tasted like plastic and was quickly discarded by all of the passengers. Will never fly with Turkish again nor through Istanbul ever again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,370,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-01-26,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,STR-IST-DOH TK 1706 A320 (TC-JUK). STR-IST was not as pleasant as previous TK flights: did TK reduce the seat pitch? No more height adjustable head rest no IFE not even overhead screens. Service food flying were TK standard (which is pretty good) but the narrow seat pitch will have me looking for alternatives if this should become normal. Onward flight to Doha on A321 was normal standard nice seats in seat IFE - that's TK I like.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,371,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-01-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,Flight 15 Istanbul-Sao Paulo/Buenos Aires as usual operated with Boeing 777-300ER. Flew Comfort/Premium Economy class. This was the best long-haul flight I have taken. What impressed me on this flight was the cabin crew: they were smiling polite and always there. I felt sick (heavy headache) and two members regularly came to me (flight time was 13.30 hours due to bad weather conditions on the Atlantic) to check if I was feeling better or not. Food by Turkish Do&Co was as always delicious. Price paid was super. I do look forward to my next TK flight which will be in six days.,Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,yes,372,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-01-30,Turkish Airlines customer review,6,I flew ORD-IST-BOM and back. Checking in and Boarding at ORD was pleasant. The ORD-IST flight left on time and they offered Turkish Delight (sweet) on board with nice touches like hot towels for the face. Istanbul airport is the worst. The gate isn't announced until just 1 hour before departure and until then there is hardly any seating whatever there is it is for patrons of the overpriced restaurants. At the gate there was no boarding plan and no announcements! Just a hoard of passengers moving towards the gate in any random order. The most intriguing factor is their double standard- flights to/from the US serve Turkish Delights and hot towels have friendly staff who speak good English. On flights to India they don't serve any welcome sweet or hot towels and the staff are rude and can barely muster up basic English. On the return trip this double standard was confirmed. Also the flights to the US connect the airport with jetways where as Indian flights have to use a bus! Flights to the US require extra screening which again is done in a totally disorganized fashion and what's more our gate changed after the screening so we had to repeat the screening at the new gate! They ask weird questions going into much more detail than US immigration ever would and make you grossly uncomfortable. Our flight was delayed almost 2 hrs out of IST due to this gate change fiasco.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,373,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-02-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,JFK-IST-DHA and return in Jan 15. Be advised that planes have no individual ventilation system and were unexpectedly quite warm on all segments. The planes on all segments were dirty. Leaving Istanbul in both directions the restroom had not been wiped down or restocked. There was trash in the seat pocket and in one instance on my seat! There was a marked difference in staff treatment of passengers. On US legs the staff were merely uninterested. On the Dhaka leg the flight attendants were actively rude. Though there was no noticeable turbulence on the Dhaka bound leg we were instructed to remain seated and not permitted to go the restroom for 5 hours. The lady in the seat in front of me called the attendant. Three times the attendant came by and switched off the light and left without asking the reason for the call. The fourth time the lady put out her hand and asked for a glass of water. The attendant rolled her eyes and half an hour later brought a half glass. Also delayed takeoff at Dhaka (which seems to be a hallmark of TA judging from these reviews) caused all passengers on the full flight to miss their connections for the night. The only announcement in the cabin at landing at 6pm was to list the connecting gates. But there were no flights until the next day. There was no assistance with arrangements. The lucky people who knew what to do and had money for a visa waited 3-4 hours outside the airport for a TA transfer to a hotel. Those without experience or funds wandered the airport all night looking for a helpful TA rep to no avail. Never again. I will pay the extra for Emirates.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,374,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-02-12,Turkish Airlines customer review,3,CPH-IST-BKK-IST-CPH. F&B offerings seating and IFE decent on all aircraft. Did not encounter one single smile on any staff on any of these 4 flights. Some of the worst I have come across. No personal touch of any kind and staff clearly not interested in their jobs. This is really a shame since hard product of TK is decent but it all falls to the ground with carelessness of passengers. Will definitely try to avoid TK as good as I can. Lounge in IST was the same feeling - never felt so unwelcome on any Airline before. Price of ticket was good but would not consider using TK Again.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,375,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

We reached Istanbul a little late and had to run to catch the connection flight. The staff was rude and was blaming us telling that they were about to close the gate and we should be more responsible. Cabin staff were also late to attend to our requests.

2015-02-24,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,The check-in and departure time are always chaotic with Turkish Airlines. I flew already 8 times with Turkish and they are usually late. Connections at Istanbul are tight which is not matching with the systematic delays of Turkish Airways. If you miss your plane the hotel is provided by Turkish Airlines but the transfer to the hotel is terrible without mentioning the terrible and unprofessional attitude from the visas service + immigration + info desks at Istanbul Airport. Globally I would not recommend Turkish Airways. Even if I omit the delay issues and even if the service on board is OK there is still this something missing that does not make me want to fly again with Turkish Airways - maybe courtesy from their staff. The only point I am impressed about is that even if Istanbul Airport seems to be an organizational chaos the luggage is usually arriving at the final destination even when the time between connection flights are tight (of course if the planes are on time).,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,381,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Having read that TK is quite good I was a little bit disappointed. Though the food was really great (the Turkish delight is delicious and I like the idea of the fresh orange juice) and I was even given a second menu the staff disappointed me. Perhaps it was only me but I didn't feel very welcome their English wasn't always understandable. Furthermore my flight from Bremen to Istanbul was delayed by over an hour and thus getting my connection was definitely exhausting. When the plane arrived at the gate my last call had already begun. Unfortunately there was no help offered by the FAs. All in all I chose not to recommend Turkish because the onboard product is just average and I prefer airlines being held by more democratic states than Turkey. Nevertheless the flight was quite cheap but in future I will try to avoid them.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,382,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

No gate so exit in severe snowfall and winds people in flip flops and t- shirts as this was from Thailand. Shipped on buses finally to terminal in utter chaos as all flights were cancelled. Thousands of people and only 3 TK representatives to help. Took into hotel at own cost rebooked tickets next morning via phone. Then headed for airport again flights cancelled again and no help anywhere and of course thousands of angry passengers stranded. TK head office is a place of shame that gave absolutely no help actually the sour lady just said no and then called for next in line. Result 2 days in IST from own pocket. Flying business and being star alliance gold gives little in this company when it matters. Even refused to be rebooked on other flights. Needless to say last flight IST-ARN was 1h late boarding commenced without communication between gate and crew so business passengers and others too stood 20 min outside of plane door watching crew clean the cabin and stock the food.

Very good seats in economy with 2-4-2 configurations. The food is good but the host and hostesses are looks like new to the trade. But they do take good care of you if asked. Understanding their English is a problem even the announcements by pilot were difficult to understand. The ground staff in Istanbul need to learn customer service. It feels like they are doing you a favor. Very curt replies and again very poor language skills. But overall I will take Turkish again from Boston.

Once from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh Return (suppose it qualifies as a flight) once from Bangkok to Tel Aviv via Istanbul Return and once from Bangkok to Tashkent via Istanbul Return. All flights were way above average - and I know what I am talking about because in the past 12 months I have flown on TG QF VN SQ NZ and PX on more than 50 return flights. I actually hate flying but have to fly to my place of assignment but flying Turkish Airlines is very good. Most cabin staff - male or female - are very good to excellent (several among the best I have ever dealt with) the food is very good IFE way above average and aircraft in very good condition (staff make sure toilets are always kept clean and are up there TG QF CX and NZ). My only real grip is rush rush at transit - Istanbul Airport not the best in the world although Turkish Airlines Lounge must be one of the best - and one of the A321 I flew on from Istanbul to Tashkent had several rows of non-reclining seats (mine 9C) so I must read Seat Guru more carefully in future.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,389,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2015-03-25,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,"Flew from Paris to Samsum via Istambul and return in Economy. From reading previous reviews on this site and others it seems TA passengers can be separated in 2 categories: Everything went as scheduled and the performance is highly rated or something goes wrong and TA customer service is at best non-existent. Luckily I was in the 1st category. In CDG TA is in the old terminal 1 (not their fault!) which is completely outdated. Departure was a little delayed due to late arrival but we recovered most of it during the flight. Very recent A321 with IFE (choice not outstanding but OK for a 3.5 hours flight). The crew spoke good English (1 stewardess spoke French) the seat pitch is comfortable (at least 10 cms / 4 "" more than AF) the food is fair both in quantity and in quality with a hot meal and a choice of drinks including wine and alcohol. A much better service than their French competitor with bus-type cabin and no IFE. The domestic flight was done on a slightly older A320 with even better seat pitch and here again crew spoke English and served some sandwich and drink. Return was of a similar standard fresh Turkish breakfast in the domestic flight good service and acceptable meal in the international flight. Istanbul airport is not at the same level but it's an other story. Safety demonstrations done in all 4 flights general condition of the aircraft's from good to excellent.

2015-03-28,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,TK8 IAD-IST. Seat 5K business class. Never again. I have been flying Qatar Airways a lot lately - no comparison. Late departure from IAD. Business cabin felt crowded with narrow aisles. Service rushed. Galleys were noisy with no attempt by the crew to be at all quiet. Seat not good with confusing controls (what does MR and M+ mean in the armrest controls?). Armrests and tray table were unmovable. So what if there’s a crew member wearing a chefs hat. The food was dreadful. Dried out. Overcooked. Tasteless. Terrible seats. Economy and business class passengers all mixed up with no clear delineation between the two cabins. The lavatories are so small that I banged my elbows in the most minimal effort to change clothes. Waste bins full before we'd even pushed back from Dulles and soap dispensers nearly empty. Unreal. Felt like Aeroflot in 1970. Appetizers dried out. I asked the flight attendant what kind of soup they were serving and she didn't know. So much for pre-departure briefings for the crew. Honestly a poor show for an airline that prides itself on its food. AVOD confusing and boring. Could never find the map. The crew spent most of its time standing at the ‘bar’ looking at all of us like we were monkeys in a cage. Really unbelievable. The soccer stars who are advertising for TK are all flying on private aircraft - make no mistake. If they ever took TK they soon switch to Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific first class. FAs walking around with their airport IDs badges hanging from their necks - what is that all about? Really disappointed with TK. For all the hype in their advertising a big letdown. Couldn't get off fast enough. Now have to endure another seven hours to DAR.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,408,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Flight delayed from GOT due to bad weather in IST. Middle seat turned down but otherwise standard economy seat and no IFE. Food ok. Arrived late and got a hotel night free of charge at IST since the flight to DAC was next day. Lounge at IST is wonderful and I really felt relaxed before boarding tk 713 to DAC. Old plane poor IFE poor service. The lights in the cabin were blinking all the flight and I was worried someone would get an epilepsy attack. no lie flat seat felt like a plane from the mid-90's. All in all not a pleasant business class experience. Flight back tk 714 on leased 330-200 this time a newer plane good service lie flat also a leased plane from jet airways. Plane on time and standard business trip. Once again short visit at the IST lounge which was good and flight from IST-GOT on good intra-europe business class with wide seats good service since we were only two passengers in the front.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,409,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2015-03-30,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,I fly Turkish to IST from several locations in Europe in economy. The airplanes tend to be a bit older and the crew tends to be pretty much the same as most airlines have in economy. Catering pluses are the fresh orange juice and warm meal which most other airlines now forgo can't speak about the inflight entertainment because I never use it. However there is one huge negative - the online checking is a mess giving PNR or e-ticket number works maybe 10% of the time and I'm forced to go to the airport early and queue to get a boarding pass even though I don't have any luggage. This is the only Star Alliance airline where this happens to me I've checked with colleagues and they all have the same problem especially on code-share tickets. I've now started to avoid Turkish flights just for this reason as I need to waste about an hour in their huge and chaotic queues at Istanbul which also destroys any potential trip satisfaction.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,411,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

No traveling to the other terminal needed. The flights were very pleasant by the quality of food (salmon shrimps even in economy) comfort and flight attendant service on these flights. Porcelain plates variety choice of food proper cutlery and napkins hot towels. Turkish delight at the beginning of the flight. nice menu cart plenty of drinks and sandwich any time you ask for during the flight. Just the whiskey is not the small bottle was given the glass.

As a frequent business class passenger who has already tried British Airways Lufthansa KLM Etihad Emirates I can only say that this was definitely the worst of them all. Old and run-down seats with parts of the seat torn down and dirty. First part of the trip with newer 777 and angled lie flat but return a recliner like on a premium economy. Serving of the food and the quality more like an economy class and nothing like a business class.

2015-04-10,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,From ORD-IST and back in economy. Row 16 and 22 respectively. Our first experience with Turkish. We requested vegetarian meals and a gluten free meal for my sister we all had excellent food and even had fresh squeezed orange juice (at least on the IST-ORD leg). The seats were comfortable too with a recline and a second option to slide the seat bottom outward giving more of a natural reclined feeling allowing better sleep without cramping the person behind you! Hot towels before the meal (I still love these simple things) and Turkish delight before service. The entertainment selection was good movies could have had a better selection but the music was fantastic. From the overall comfort and food quality I was able to sleep for 5 hours on a 9.5 hour night trip. I never sleep that much in economy! I believe their aircraft's sacrifice a few of the bathrooms for food/beverage/storage. It seems the bathrooms get used a bit more though there are never lines. The flight crew kept the bathrooms cleaned several times during the journeys. I would definitely fly them again mainly from the food and comfort perspective. When you put that in comparison to the price it works out pretty well.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,416,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2015-04-14,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,PRG-IST and IST-PRG. My first flight with Turkish Airlines and quite a disappointment. We were about one hour late on both flights - as the air conditioning was not on it was awfully hot on the plane but no water was offered. The seats were not very comfortable and there was very little space. The flight attendants did not seem very interested in what people were doing (like playing with their mobiles and reclining the backs of their seats during the take-off). On the return flight there was a family with an infant squealing like an air raid siren sitting two rows away from me which turned the whole flight into a torture exercise. To finish on a positive note - food was very good and I appreciated having my own screen with flight information. Yet in future I will try to avoid Turkish Airlines and it is a mystery for me how they can score so well in the ratings.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,419,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I found a piece of chewed chewing gum stuck on the seat in front of me which proves no professional cleaning was done.

2015-04-19,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,"Flew to London Heathrow from Hurghada via Istanbul. Everything started off fine. Punctual and a comfortable business class seat on what appeared to be a brand new 737-800. The problems then began with the plane landing in the ""wrong"" Istanbul airport. One very brief announcement from the Captain about weather and that is where the information stopped. No one on board was able to give us any information about missed connecting flights whilst we waited on the tarmac. Plane was full of connecting passengers. Plane then takes off to the correct airport. On arrival there was nobody from Turkish Airlines to process or inform customers of what to do. Eventually we found the transfer desk which had a minimum of 250 people descending on only 4 very harassed and extremely impolite ticket agents. When I finally got to the front the ticket desk agent simply stood up and walked away announcing that it was the end of his shift. Got a new pass for a plane leaving 5 hours later. Still no apology. Just thrown at me as if I should be grateful. Found the business class lounge that was also stuffed to the gunnels at the entry reception and barely a seat available in the place. Summoned to the new gate at far end of the airport. It was a full Airbus 330-300. There was a double security check leading to a seated area that was the size for a small commuter jet flight. 280 or so Passengers were rammed into each other waiting for the coach. There was no Business class fast track. On board staff were the most unfriendly bunch and seemed to have a collapse in their understanding of basic English. One seemed to really struggle with the concept of ""Could I have my lunch a bit later?"" Suffice to say my meal was served with no menu. I was then told that it was either Chicken or Pasta. They forgot to offer me the dessert and I had to chase them for it and was told ""We will see if we have anything left."" Even on disembarkation at the plane of the door they pointedly refused to say goodbye. The main hub is a complete mess and deeply unpleasant experience and the staff on board are feckless and rude. I would put this Business class experience down as the worst premium flight of my life. I fly on average 100 times per year nearly always in premium cabins. so that is saying something.

2015-04-24,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,"We flew LGW-IST-CMB on 16/4 and being a frequent flyer and Star Alliance Gold member I can easily say that this was the worst flying experience of my life. I have never met so rude uninterested and unhelpful staff on any other airline before. To start with I was denied access to a lounge at LGW. I am aware that Star Alliance do not have a lounge there but all other airlines I have used before have given me access to contracted lounges. TK did not. First flight as relatively OK on their new B737 but seats were very uncomfortable. Then we arrived in IST and the problems started. When I went to the lounge and connected my phone to the wifi I found an email from them saying ""your flight to {1} is delayed please contact {2}"". I went to the lounge reception and showed them the email and they told me it's nothing to worry about. When I looked on their website though I saw that the IST-CMB flight was delayed by 5 hours. From then it took us about 3 hours in order to sort out a hotel. When the flight departed the next morning there was no mention at all by anyone as to why the flight was delayed or a single apology. 10 hours on that plane and nothing. The crew were the most unprofessional and rude cabin crew. Not interested in passenger satisfaction and not interested in safety. Their English was very poor.

That alone impressed me but then when I saw how nicely it was arranged/presented and how good it tasted I was blown away. I don't think I've ever 'cleared my plate' on with any previous airline meal but that happened on both flights (to and from Istanbul). There was a pillow and headphones on each seat and the in-flight movie selection was incredible - my only complaint is that there were too many movies to choose from. Very satisfied and impressed with my first experience with this airline. Would absolutely recommend it to others and would definitely fly Turkish Airlines again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,442,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-05-18,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,28th April 2015 flight TK2019. Night flight domestic from Kayseri to Istanbul. Flight delayed 30 minutes. Check in was fast and efficient. Check in staff were friendly and helpful. Airbus 321 fairly full flight. Meal was a sandwich with delicious apple cake and red bean salad. Beverage service hot and cold provided. IFE not available but it was only 15 hours. Overall a nice flight for first time flying Turkish.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,443,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2015-05-20,Turkish Airlines customer review,10,Hong Kong to Istanbul in Business on the latest TK 777-300ER with the brand new business and economy seats. There is no more Comfort (Premium Economy) on this aircraft. It was a great flight: this new business class cabin looks extremely modern IFE has a lot of new contents and features to choose from and comes along with a new remote Emirates style very easy to use. The layout of the lavatories has also been updated and it is bigger now. Food was amazing (but this is not a news with TK). Excellent young all-male cabin crew extremely friendly and well- trained. They made me feel looked after throughout the 11 hrs flight. Again highly recommended.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,445,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2015-05-27,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,ZRH-IST-KIX and return. Plane from Zürich to Istanbul was 4.5 hrs late missed the night flight to Osaka took the next flight 24 hrs later and the suitcase took an additional 24 hrs detour. The transportation to the hotel in Istanbul due to the flight missed was organized however the hotel was a 40 min ride across the Bosporus arriving at 4am in the morning. Okay the in-flight service was okay but would I fly TK again? Not if I can avoid it because there was no information during all these delays my online feedback afterwards produced only prefabricated and unrelated standard answers and more importantly minor delays can produce quickly a 24 hrs. delay if there is only 1 flight per 24 hrs (true not only from long distance trips!).,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,448,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-05-31,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,Jakarta to Istanbul with a stopover at Singapore Changi. Check in was smooth even though Turkish didn't have a fixed check in counter in CGK. Boarding was fast and smooth. On CGK-SIN flight sandwich was served a good one with a selection of drinks. Then we have to leave the plane and reboard again one hour later at Changi. The SIN- IST leg was great the crew served properly but it lacked eye contact. They were chatting with fellow crew members while they were serving passengers. The catering service was good and the amenity case was a good looking tin pencil case which was a nice touch. The IFE was decent with a broad choice of movies and music. The return trip was in the same quality except a fair 45-60 minutes delay because of congestion at Istanbul Ataturk. My conclusion Turkish is a great choice for a long haul flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,449,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2015-05-31,Turkish Airlines customer review,9,IAD-IST-BLQ and return. The plane was clean and with adequate seat pitch. Plane left Washington with only a very minor delay. Turkish delight passed out and later a hot towel service. No cocktail service. Dinner at 1.40am and it was the best airline meal I have had accompanied with great Turkish wine. I asked for and was given a refill on the wine. After coffee service and trays cleared crew came around with another drink service. Bright lights finally dimmed after 3am when it was already light outside. Global positioning system not working on this flight at least not displayed. Entertainment systems not working too well only limited number of selection. Crew passed out amenity kits normally not seen in economy. Children had their own amenity kit and a stuffed bear. After dinner a bottle of water passed out to all passengers additional water available in galley as well as snacks. Crew were friendly; a few not well versed in English. Seats comfortable enough for a good sleep. Lights on two hours before landing for a delicious hot breakfast. An hour before landing the captain made his first announcement of the flight detailing the weather conditions in Istanbul. One toilet I used before landing had run out of water. Unable to flush or wash hands. Upon landing plane parked away from terminal and we were bussed in. Our layover in Istanbul was over ten hours (19 hours) so given a night at airport hotel with bus transportation and breakfast voucher. Quick and efficient. The next morning due to a miscommunication the Turkish Airlines bus to the terminal was nowhere to be seen at the appointed hours but the hotel shuttle took us ten minutes later. Boarding was by bus to plane parked remotely. Good seating headsets for video screens from ceiling. Showing short videos and mapping of flight. Choice of two hot meals and full bar service on this short 2.5 hour flight. Coffee service too. Meal selected was excellent. Upon return check in was handled by Star Alliance staff at BLQ. Brisk businesslike to the point of being short. Boarding again by bus to plane. Newspapers not passed out. Seating the best of any intraEuropean flight I have been on. So much leg room I had to lean forward quite a bit to eat. No videos nor mapping on this flight. Departure on time and a wonderful smooth flight to IST with another delicious lunch with again full bar service. Flight attendants cheerful and happy. Arrival on time into a gate with air bridge in front of passport control. Overnight again at expense of Turkish. Before boarding we went through six security checkpoints. All but one were friendly and courteous. Airbridge to plane Flight was full. Seat did not seem to recline properly. No newspapers passed out or at entrance. Due to air traffic control delays flight took off one hour late. Entertainment system working fine as well as route mapping. Captain made announcements. There was some gaps in service on this flight. Our section in the cabin was skipped over for hot towels. About 1.5 hours into the flight drinks were offered. No crackers or nuts no napkins. 2.5 hours into the flight lunch arrived at my seat. A delicious chicken meal. Before landing another wonderful hot meal. Landing process at IAD and baggage delivery normal and without problems. I have given this airline nine stars mainly for the great catering and beverages and mostly friendly and efficient staff. Altogether a very good product.

2015-06-04,Turkish Airlines customer review,8,LHR-SFO (return) via IST. Check-in at LHR was fast en efficient and the PrimeClass lounge was nice with a good food selection. Boarding at LHR was a bit chaotic but we got on board. First leg (LHR-IST) was a A321 with large seats in BC very comfortable for the short trip food was ok and the aircrew were friendly. IFE was an older system with 4 movie running on a loop no great but for a three hour flight it was acceptable. IST airport is very overcrowded and even the BC lounge was packed so I decided to get some sleep at the airport hotel. A little pricey but well worth it. Boarding at IST was without any BC priority boarding and extra document and security check before being bussed to the plane. While airports like the old Doha airport had this down to an art IST seems to have turned this in to organised chaos not a nice experience at all. Second leg was a B777 with a 2-3-2 configuration. I had problems seeing how this would work prior to flying by I saw both a single mum with two children and two parents with a child for whom this setup with 3 seats in the middle worked a charm. Flight crew were nice and service minded but very slow to bring food out and the chefs costume is a terrible gimmick they should drop sooner rather than later as unlike Gulf Airlines where you can discuss the meal with an actual chef and make changes to the menu at Turkish they simply take an order from the menu and that is it. Food was good and plentiful. The seat was ok for sitting and eating or lying down but getting a comfortable position to relax in the middle was very hard and took some fiddling with the limited controls. IFE offered true AVOD with a large selection of films and TV shows as well as live TV. Films were not all the latest and greatest but I think there was something for everyone. Return journey started out better than at LHR with quick and efficient check-in at SFO and boarding done in a controlled and orderly fashion. I had a quick look in the United Club lounge with was nice and quiet but had a very limited selection of food. Plane was again a B777 with a good and attentive flight crew although they seemed a bit more robotic than the previous crews. Food was excellent and plentiful although again it seemed to take quite a while to get it served. Short transit in IST where boarding descended in to a new level of chaos with absolutely no announcements no BC priority boarding and extra document checks. As a seasoned flyer I knew to just get in a queue and get on with it but a rookie flyer would have been lost in the chaos. Not good enough and this needs to be changed fairly sharpish. Again a A321 this time with a refurbished cabin which meant the IFE was true AVOD (the same system as on the B777) and nice new seats. Again a pleasant flight crew that spent forever getting food served. The food was good but we got in to LHR about 20 minutes late because we were 30 minutes late out of IST. Price considered the offering is very good as long as you accept that IST airport is old over capacity and chaotic beyond belief.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,454,,,,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

All flights were delayed except for the last leg on return flight from Istanbul to Colombo via Male where I really would have prayed for a delay as my connecting flight got 1.30 hrs delayed from Antalya! Good in-flight service and food etc. Flight delays are so common that you spend an addition of 5-6 hrs on the way than originally scheduled! Plus mad rushing from Domestic to International Terminal in Istanbul with only about 20 minutes for the connecting flight. One of my bags came on the flight. Other came one day.

Touch screen remote which itself has a large interactive LCD screen/player works independent to the main screen! Movie choices: Amazing! Audio albums: Biggest collection I've seen. Seat is a bit narrow however very comfortable to sleep in. Amenity kits were from Cerruti. Although arrival in Istanbul was disappointing due to delayed baggage delivery. The only unfortunate thing is this is their best product and will probably not be used in Asia ever because Turkish heavily favours US destinations over others. eg.

2015-06-19,Turkish Airlines customer review,4,"While the inflight service and comfort level of the seats were mediocre at best, my feedback deals with the service by the airline staff at the gate. My elderly parents were booked on a flight from Izmir to Houston via Istanbul and were to meet me in Istanbul for the Istanbul to Houston leg. The airline only gave 45 minutes between the Izmir flight and Istanbul-Houston flight. I assumed this meant that there would be no extra passport checks (since that was all done in Izmir) and that there would be gate attendants to direct the passengers trying to make the connection to the proper gate to expedite the process. That was not the case. The plane from Izmir was stood on the tarmac for 25 minutes so they had far less than 45 minutes to get to the Istanbul to Houston flight, which was already boarding at the time and there was no guidance at all. When I inquired as to whether the flight from Izmir had arrived at the Istanbul-Houston gate and when I explained the situation, the staff ignored me and told me to step out of the way. They told me my parents had 5 minutes to get there and that if they didn't the plane would leave without them. They also stated that there was nothing they would do. They would not announce their names and began to laugh at me and speak about me in Turkish in a mocking way. In short, not only were they were neither helpful nor sympathetic, but they were rude. Other passengers boarding the flight noticed this and expressed their displeasure, this was even echoed by some of the security staff of the airport. My parents finally made it. I wanted to like Turkish Airlines, however my trip made it quite plain that this airline is only a premiere airline for those in Business and First class. It is only a premiere airline if you don't ask any questions and only speak when spoken to.

The best part was the meal. Wine lovers will enjoy a small bottle on your tray as well. After the meal service they basically disappeared and never came out with drinks or snacks.

2015-07-06,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,"In reading through other reviews, I can see that my experience unfortunately is not unique. Customer service is lacking. This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines – starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips – first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasn’t a big surprise – despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time – on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul – one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation – and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members – first to a supervisor in the check in area – who said “no” and that was that. At the care Point – the staff couldn’t care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate. At the gate, we had the most unprofessional and rude encounter and staff said no. I was left with the impression that, no one cares, no one feels responsible and accountable, there’s an acute lack of training and proficiency in the most basic part of customer care. If Turkish Airlines wants to deliver on the brand promise – Europe’s Best Airline, they need to embrace a better approach to service – caring goes a long way when you are traveling, a smile, empathy and helpful interactions would have made a world of difference.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,479,Family Leisure,Istanbul to Los Angeles,July 2015,,1,1,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2015-07-17,Turkish Airlines customer review,1,"I am a wheelchair user and traveled alone this time. Turkish Airlines staff made a problem why I travel alone, remarking ""I am not supposed to travel alone"", ask me to sign a document which says they are not responsible for any damage or injury if I would enter the plane. No other passenger was asked to sign this document. Also, after disconnecting the joystick of my power wheelchair, they did not allowed me to take the joystick with me, but put it in a plastic bag and wanted to leave it like that in the cargo part. After I disagreed, because it can be easily damaged, Turkish Airlines staff said to me that the company would rather pay for the joystick than something to happen to the plane because of the joystick. The joystick itself, when disconnected from the batteries has no any power, our laptops and phones can make more problem than disconnected joystick. I have been traveling with Turkish Airlines for couple of times and what always happens is that I am informed as a wheelchair user that I am not able to use the toilet during the flight, because Turkish Airlines does not have cabin chair during the flight, nor they would assist to push the chair to the toilet (which is service other companies offer). The longest flight with Turkish Airlines, in which I was not able to use the toilet was flying from Istanbul to Cape Town, with two hours stop in Johannesburg, so for 15 hours I was not able to use toilet. For passengers without disability, Turkish Airlines may be a good choice, because of their good connections all around the world, but for me as a wheelchair user is a headache. Because of the legislation, when Turkish Airlines is flying in USA, they do have different policy for people with disabilities because in USA you can not discriminate someone because of disability.

2015-07-23,Turkish Airlines customer review,5,I have flown with Turkish Air on previous occasions and found them very good. However this experience was well below their usual good record. Firstly I have to comment on the Turkish Airlines business lounge at Istanbul which would have to be the best lounge anywhere. But unfortunately it's a rose amongst the thorns as the rest of this airport is just awful and unfriendly. Our problems started at boarding where there was no priority whatsoever - in fact we were the last to board. Then the seats in the Boeing 737 are the same as you would expect on a 1 hour flight - very difficult to sleep sitting up. And the chef was missing which is a point of difference for this airline. This was an 11 hour overnight flight so they really need to upgrade the business product. We mysteriously had a 1 hour stopover at some Russian airport on the way that I was not expecting and was not able to use the business lounge there (small as it was). Lastly out bags came out without any priority. So I was really wondering why I paid 3 times the economy ticket price. I have previously been a strong supporter of Turkish Airlines but they let me down badly on this route.

When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777.

Not only did Turkish Airlines not tell us this until we arrived in Istanbul, they basically yelled this at us and then the agent walked away from the desk - worst customer service experience ever.

2015-08-06,Turkish Airlines customer review,2,"Turkish Airlines night flight from Heathrow through Ataturk on my way to Bulgaria. Arriving in Ataturk around 4 AM, I waited for the gate indication for the 7:30 flight to Bulgaria. Around 5:30am, it opened, so I went to the gate and showed the pair of Turkish Airlines employees my boarding pass and sat down right in the front row of the departure lounge. Exhaustion took over and I slumped in my chair, jerking awake to see the bus leaving for the plane and the big red letters CLOSED. I jumped to the desk and asked the man why he did not call me or wake me up, when he knew I was on that flight. He simply smirked and said “Not my responsibility”. I asked him what I should do, but he was determined to brush me off, simply saying “try going upstairs to the transfer desk.” Well, that set off a chain of absurdity the likes of which I’ve never seen in my life. It seemed that every employee, either of Ataturk Airport or of Turkish Airlines, ranged from nonchalant to downright belligerent. I was sent on a wild goose chase from desk to desk to desk, with practically everyone having the “not my responsibility” attitude. There was no solution at the “transfer desk”, and they kept sending me to other desks in what began to feel like some kind of absurd hazing ritual. Finally, after running the gauntlet several times, I was informed that I would have to clear immigration to get to the Turkish Airlines sales desk in the airport. Supposedly that was the only path to a solution for my problem. I stood in line for over an hour to get stamped, but was told “You need a Turkish visa.” Incredulous, on my way to the visa desk, I asked the same information clerk why he didn’t tell me that I needed a visa, and he (I am not making this up) told me “You didn’t ask. It’s not my responsibility to think for you.” At this point, I was choking back tears. I just couldn’t believe it. I got back into line after paying 20 pounds for a visa and about an hour later finally got to the Turkish Airlines sales desk. The clerk informed me that it was “not Turkish Airlines’ problem” that I was not notified of the boarding and that I would have to pay an additional 265 euros in order to be able to board the next available flight, which was twelve hours later. I thought that was extremely unfair, given that I was at the gate on time and had identified myself to the ground staff. I thought I had the right to be informed of the flight leaving and woken up. Nothing I said to them was received with any amount of comprehension, compassion, or understanding. They said that if I didn’t like their solution, I could go to their “supervisor’s desk” at counter B15. At counter B15, I waited and waited until I finally got to talk to the extremely annoyed agent, who curtly informed me that she was “not authorized” to handle my request, and that I was welcome to call customer service at the help phone. The lady on the help phone was the most helpful out of anyone I had spoken to in a now 5-hour drama, but even she was only able to “make a report”. Long story short, I was forced to pay 178 euros to board the next flight, and when I got to Sofia that night, I saw that Turkish Airlines lost my luggage on top of everything. Three days later, I was informed that Turkish Airlines will not deliver my lost luggage, so I am forced to pay another 100 euros in taxis to get to the airport in Sofia to retrieve my things.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,497,Solo Leisure,London to Sofia via Istanbul,July 2015,,1,1,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

As mich as I've reviewed the good I'm also going to review the bad. Considering that they are competing with Etihad on this route it is very disappointing to see the aircraft quality. Business class seating was falling apart so badly that you could see the metal poles beneath it on some seats. Headrests too were so uncomfortable as well. The food and staff were fantastic on the flight and I can't fault this at all but the rest of it I don't have anything to complain about at all. The TK lounge in Istanbul is phenomenal as well. Flight departures on both sectors has actually been delayed in excess of an hour with everyone sitting onboard waiting in hot stuffy temperatures. At least on the IST-BEG flight there was an additional drink service but the poor people in Y didn't get this.

The way they handled the whole situation, kept us waiting for a long time both at check in, and also at boarding, the whole inconvenience was simply terrible experience. They offered a EUR50 check as compensation and thought this would be fair. After returning home, I wrote a complaint for the airline and their reaction is as scandalous as their operations:  ""Concerning the matter you raised in your message, passengers not showing up for their flights cause flights to take place with empty seats. For this reason, as does every airline, Turkish Airlines, too, sells more tickets than the number of seats on the aircraft, from time to time. This situation is called overbooking, and in the case that all the passengers booked show up, some of our passengers unfortunately are unable to fly on the same flight."" Hence they think by explaining me as stupid kid, what overbooking means, they think downgrading is a fair action on their side and that was it. I am a frequent business traveller, this attitude and customer service is outrageous and luckily not everyday routine with other airlines. By the way, same thing happened to fellow travellers also on our way back Bodrum-Istambul-Budapest. Not just they downgraded them because of overbooking (seems to be pretty common with Turkish Airlines) but one of my friends ticket was also deleted from their system. Never heard of anything like this before. When she presented the printed version of her ticket (luckily she had it with her), Turkish Airlines said their system shows that because of overbooking, she was not only downgraded, but also transferred to another flight 1 day earlier than the actual flight.

Like everybody else, we went to the transfer desk and they put us on the next flight which is one day later. Next to the transfer desk there is a a place to make a free phone call to inform your family about the delay. This is where the trouble began, since there is a delay on almost every connecting flight they provide a single phone for all those people and there was a very long queue. We waited for about 2 hours on the queue and when there was only one person in front of me, this women came with one of the desk attendants and he let her to cut in front of me. I didn't think that was right and I complained and as he result he disconnect the telephone line and shut down everything, without caring even a bit about all those people on the line. The next step was to get a hotel to spend the night, which is located outside the airport and we need a visa to go out. The visa can be bought inside the airport but they refuse to accept our Ethiopian passport, and they demanded a resident permit from Italy. I had the permit card, with my daughters name included on the same card, it is the Italian immigration law that minors do not get independent permit card, but their name is included on one of the parents card. The Turkish police refused this and told me that I can get the visa but my daughter can't, which in my opinion a stupid police. When I try to get an explanation for such stupid rule, every one of them was giving me the same answer ""I don't know"". So we spent 24 hours inside the Istanbul airport, buying food with our own money. Even the people working at the food courts are very rude. The next day we boarded the aircraft on time but it took off 6 hours late, they even changed the entire cabin crew at one point. So we had a 30 hours delay in total. On our return flight we again missed our connecting flight but this time we waited only 3 hours for the next one.

I was informed at check-in that my flight had been delayed 4 hours, upon further check at the airline's desk, I was informed that I had a choice to stay in Istanbul for 24 hours as there were no connecting flight due to the delay. The airline would provide lodging, transport to the hotel, and I only needed to apply for an evisa online. Up to this point the service had been slow but fine. This attitude had a 360 degree turn in Istanbul. As soon as I landed in Istanbul, a few passengers who would be staying at the provided hotel, myself included, tried to look for a way out of the airport and onto the shuttle bus. We were met with inefficient and unreasonable staff, my politeness was returned with unbelievably rude attitudes. We turned from counter to counter, with the staff giving us unhelpful directions. A counter lady near passport control informed another passenger that she needed a visa to get out of passport control. Frustrated of running at 3 in the morning with minimal sleep, I told her that I had a visa in which she continually urged that I needed a visa and finally, questioned my words when she asked with condescending demeanor whether I had the right visa. I took my visa through passport control where my documents and passport were thrown on the counter without response that I could leave. Still, I was lucky as I found out the next day, a few of the passengers had to stay at the airport (for more than 16 hours) because they had not been informed to apply for a visa in Lyon and after running around the airport once again trying to apply for a visa, was met with unhelpful staff and contradictory directions. Sadly, this was not the end of my nightmare. The insulting attitudes of the staff I had to bear when I asked for a certificate of delay at the airport before my flight was appalling. Again, I was turned from counter to counter (the staff seems not to have the ability to direct one to the right counter at first request) At my last stop I requested the certificate and explained my delay. Shockingly, the staff with scorn and disdain replied that my flight was not delayed, why or how did I believe it to be delayed? If it hadn't been delayed I would have been on my flight that second, not running madly around the airport struggling with airline staffsthat seems to despise and absurdly question the intellect of their customers. The breaking point came when he asked me why my flight had been delayed. No, the staff did not have the courtesy to tell me why my flight was delayed but had the audacity to put that question upon me. I have been very disappointed with Turkish Airlines on this horrendous trip. Through my encounters with the airline staff I felt insulted and laughed at.

When you arrive or depart from IST, you may be transported to/from your plane via a bus. Upon arrival or deplaning of your aircraft, you have to navigate a flight of stairs exposed to the weather. Despite what airline staff tell you, if you are connecting through IST, you must leave yourself a bare minimum of 90 minutes to make your flight. Due to the possible great distance from one gate to another, at least 15 minutes transit time from your plane to the gate via their bus system, the lack of people movers, and the overcrowding of the airport itself, you risk missing your flight if you allow less than 90 minutes between flights.  TK does not use a rope system similar to the one you encounter passing through security, at their check in desk and you can wait a very long time for what should be a quick process. Personal experience with connecting from arrival until I reached Gate 226 for my connecting flight (very last gate in the airport) took 50 minutes and I was allotted 60 minutes.

The transfer at Istanbul is a shambles that does not reflect well on the airline or the image of Turkey. The first flight from London to Istanbul was a half full business class cabin with a flat bed. The six hour flight from Istanbul to Entebbe was in a very small and cramped business class cabin. No flat bed which was odd given the length and timing of the flight. On both flights crew vanished behind their curtain (which seemed important for them to keep firmly closed) to talk loudly after the food and drink service only to show their faces again when getting the plane ready for landing (curtain pulled back at the very possible last minute). Not sure the point of the Chef on board. Turkish Airlines use of the United Airlines lounge at Heathrow Terminal 2 which is lucky, given the 15-20 minute walk from the security area, near the TK boarding gate. No time to sample the lounge at Ataturk Airport given the botched transfer. Turkish Airlines ground handling agent at Entebbe Airport are well used  to, it seems, dealing with multiple passengers with lost luggage.

At Check-in at Dublin airport all basiinettes for the first leg of our journey from Dublin to Istanbul had already been taken which was annoying but ok with us. However, the second leg of the journey from Istanbul to Dammam, we were informed by the check-in person that she was unable to allocate the basinette seats for us since it had been 'closed' out from her system, even though this flight wasn't due to depart for another 13 hours. We were allocated seats for the second leg in row 29. On boarding the second flight I noticed that one set of basinettes seats were occupied by a man and woman who had no child with them. I brought this to the attention of the nearest cabin crew and she informed me that she would notify the senior purser. Of course nothing happened, no one came to me, no one offered an apology or an explanation. I made an online complaint about this and other issues also, to Turkish Airlines but got nowhere with them; they totally ignored my complaint.  They are relatively cheap compared to other airlines but there is way too much hassle that paying that bit extra with another airline for a relatively hassle free flying experience makes a lot of sense.  This was only the second time we had flown with Turkish airlines. On every occasion all of our flights were delayed. At Istanbul airport, both the main departure area is too narrow and always crowded, even after their recent refurbishment and the departure gates are an absolute shambles with no segregation of flights. Boarding the flight seems to always be by shuttle bus which takes some time and buses are crowded. No priority is given to families or elderly people it would seem, from our experience.

So we had three seats for us and our son hadn't to sit on the lap. Food was excellent. Prior to the main menu a Piece of turkish lokum has been served which was delicious.

I returned the vegetarian pasta and nothing else was given as a supplement. Online check in service did not work for me. Maybe because I got my ticket through a travel agency, I could not do online check in. I was then given a seat that was a bit tight ( I am 6 ""4). I asked the desk officer on my departure if I could be given a better seat, possibly an exit and he said ""My boss will query me if I give you"". He ended up giving me because I appealed and shortly before take off, he came and gave me another boarding pass in the lounge reminding me he told me he could get into trouble for assisting me.

I had to call several times due to many issues, and each phone call was much longer than it should be because of the language barrier and their unwillingness to simply do their job. The business lounge at Istanbul airport is beautiful - made ugly by the rude staff. Extremely unhelpful. A man beside us asked for the wi-fi password (after he just sat down, unpacked, hooked up his electronics) and the lounge staff rudely told him to go ask at the desk. The wi-fi password was on a table tent on the very table. Close to my flight time, I went to ask the concierge about my boarding time and flight gate (since it wasn't on the ticket), she pointed at the ticked in my hand and condescendingly asked ""you cannot read?"". I explained its not on it. She said she didn't know and I should go outside to the Turkish airlines desk and ask. I did - they were too busy socializing with each other and brushed me off saying they don't know. I angrily told them I almost missed my earlier flight because of not knowing my gate.

Also, when your glass or cup is empty, it is usually promptly taken away (instead of offering a refill).

I looked forward to the flight because I love Turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Turkish people.  I flew to Istanbul and noticed I was invisible to Turkish Airlines staff. They focused their attention on their Turkish customers.  I had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it. After about an hour on my knees I finally asked someone to hang it. They also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow, blanket etc. They made the beds of their Turkish clientele, but my seat did not even have this packet, nor was I asked if I wanted my bed to be made. The food, however, was excellent. From Istanbul to Dusseldorf I experienced something I've only experienced in third-world travel: Flies. A host of flies bothered us the entire way. As they delivered trays of food, flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays. The return trip was worse. Flies again plagued us from Dusseldorf to Istanbul.  But the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes. She asked me if I wanted an aisle seat, and I said yes. I then added, ""I flew bulkhead from Istanbul to Dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again."" Her response ""Of course."" Imagine my shock when I discovered my 12 hour flight from Istanbul to Chicago was a bulkhead middle seat. What sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler, ""Would you like an aisle seat,"" and then give them a middle seat? Or acknowledge the bulkhead's lack of desirability, and then placing the passenger there for 12 hours? Turkish Airlines should come with this warning. No matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight, it is not worth it.  The customer processing system went out of order in Istanbul prior to the flight to Chicago. Every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper. So, they held up the boarding of the flight, and sent down segments. Normally, you would expect the business class to go first, followed by the business class. Not in Turkey. The most important quality a passenger can have is being Turkish. So, the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in Istanbul. Meaning, about 90% of the first boarders were locals. Then, once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes, complete chaos reigned. If I can avoid flying Turkish Airlines I will.

Flight attandant was angry with me, because she came 3x to tell me that I have to stop using my iPhone (on airlplane mode) during landing and take off - but on some other airlines this is allowed.

My husband had flown with Turkish Airlines recently and had glowing reports, I was pleased to have had a similarly good experience. Seats in economy were very comfortable in all sectors and it was great to have IFE for the IST-LON routes. On our flight out, a passenger appeared to have passed away on the inbound IST-LGW flight so the flight was delayed by an hour. No information was given at LGW, but I was one of the few who might have figured out what had happened and I expect that most passengers would be more comfortable not knowing. Crew were welcoming and friendly but there were no forced smiles. It couldn't have been a great day for them but they showed utmost professionalism throughout the journey. Food was excellent, there was plenty to drink, flight was full. Not many toilets for Economy passengers, but they were well maintained and kept clean. Many of the passengers would not have made their connecting flights. I had a two hour transit window which was reduced to one hour. I walked purposefully (did not need to clear any security for this particular journey) and got to my gate as passengers were boarding. It was a long walk. I do not recommend a transit time of less than 2 hours with Turkish Airlines here. The next flight was also very full in economy but my seat was extremely comfortable and I appreciated the foot rests. Entertainment options were even more extensive than on my earlier flight. Food, again, was fantastic. I doubt any airline gives you better food in economy (better than some Business Class meals I've had). Unfortunately, about a third of the way into the flight I became ill. The crew swooped into action, called amongst the passengers for medical assistance and I had my pulse and blood pressure checked. Business class was a lot less busy than Economy and I was isolated from other passengers in a business class chair that had been turned into a bed for me. The crew kept a check on my throughout the rest of the flight and kept me hydrated. The worst of my illness passed by the time we arrived over South Korea and I took myself back to my Economy chair for landing. Thanks to the crew, I was left in a fit state to continue my journey (just needed an extra sick bag for the road). The flight back was less eventful but standards were just as high. The flight from ICN to IST was delayed by an hour. Again, I had a two hour transit window that was halved and I arrived at my gate for the IST-LHR flight as it was boarding. I really enjoyed my flights and appreciated the care and service I was given. I don't hesitate to recommend this airline but I do stress how important it is to have a long enough transit window to deal with an unforeseen delay.

Sure their planes are nice and new, but their service is getting worse every time I fly. Their customer service (online or via phone) has been pretty bad for a while, but now it's spreading to their in-flight services. The hostesses behave rudely to passengers raising their voices. They don't come right away when you push the call button. I waited an hour to get a cup of water on my last flight. This is unacceptable. The food on board used to be better. In the past I would actually look forward to eating it, but lately their food quality is slipping. On my last trip I wanted chicken but they ran out by the time they came to my row. Istanbul Ataturk Airport is very poorly operated. We are constantly transported by bus to and from the planes rather than boarding at a gate. My last trip it was raining and we got wet getting off the plane. The in-flight entertainment is decent. They have plenty of movies to watch, but not so many TV shows.

The airplane supposed to be used for that particular flight was normally, as every day, an A330-200 with their Business seat flat-bed, angle-free, 2x2x2 configuration. But unfortunately, in late minute, their plan changed. Probably due to the fact that the plane was not full at all (even the replacement plane, A321). The big dissapointement was when we entered this A321. It was a very old one, in 3x3 configuration, with no real business seat. So even we paid really expensive business class ticket, we got seated in Economy Seat, with the ""chance"" that we were only 2 person in a 3 seat row. But the leg-space was still really tight, and seat really narrow. Bad service, old plane, no screen or inflight entertainment, really bad seating for that price.

So they rejected any compensation, eventhough I missed my connection flight in Singapore, I had to spend one night in Singapore instead of taking my connecting flight to Denpasar, Bali.

Because we didn't have a chance to exchange currency, and because it was past dinner time at the hotel, we could not eat. The airline staff also refused to answer questions regarding the plane or when the next flight would leave.

There were over 100 passengers at the desk by then, and we demanded explanation. The 2 persons who came to represent Turkish Airlines just told us to give them our passports and final destination. My itinerary was 6 days in Turkey and 7 days in Italy. The staff took me and my wife to Lufthansa to board a plane which flew to Munich and then to Venice.

The area we were kept in was very crowded and not equipped to handle thousands of passengers they were bussing to the planes. Then we were kept in the plane for seven hours. Finally we were let off the plane. Once we got back to the airport we had to pass through customs and saw that they had made no allowances for the mess they themselves had created. Nobody seemed to know where we should go or what we should do. Then it was more waiting in various lines to get rebooked. Next day our flight was cancelled again. More lines and hours of waiting to rebook. Turkish Airlines has this ""amazing"" system where one cannot get rebooked at a check-in counter and instead has to go to a special desk called ""ticket sales"" to get rebooked. There are at most 10 of these desks throughout the airport, which were trying to process thousands of passengers yesterday. So after Turkish Airlines cancels your flight, they make you wait in line for hours for the privilege of getting rebooked.

Unfortunately no luggage made it with the passengers. Both return flights had very little leg room and were the smallest legroom seats we have had on long haul flights - less than 1 hour internal flights within Thailand.

It was difficult to find someone who could speak English and when you did, they were rude and condescending. We waited for over 7 hours at the transfer desk to get another flight. We were told the airline would provide us with hotel accommodations, but we were shocked at the length of the line requiring another 5 to 6 hour wait. Eventually we paid for our own accommodation. I was horrified by the way customers' escalating anger and in some cases, medical emergencies were handled or in this case, mishandled.

I am assuming that many of the passengers in business class were passengers from other cancelled flights, as our seat numbers were changed at the last minute (at the boarding gate). After take off, I waited until the seat belt light had gone off before unbuckling and going to the toilet. Once there the chief steward told me to sit back down as the light was still on - I can only assume he'd turned it off prematurely and then back on again after I'd walked to the toilet. I sat back down and waited for him to turn it off again. One passenger got up while the light was on and used the loo. I complained to the chief steward who said, he was ok to use it as he was about to turn the light off anyway. The same steward told another complaining passenger that if he didn't like the service he was more than welcome to leave the plane. I also complained that the lack of hygiene due to non-functioning washing facilities meant the plane wasn't fit for use. He dismissed my complaint. The leather covering of the raised seat arms were velcro-ed on, but the velcro had worn free leaving exposed dirty undersides. This is in no way business class standard - in fact it was less comfortable than economy (I travelled economy with a group to Kilimanjaro in October - that was a far more pleasant experience, despite a malfunctioning air con system leaving the cabin sweltering). The lounge at Istanbul is impressive, but be warned, the lack of their own lounges at other airports is a negative aspect of the experience. At Manchester, the Aspire lounge was in need of a good clean. At Kuala Lumpur the Premier Plaza lounge was packed to capacity, with lots of children and seats very close together. Wine is not included in the drinks service. Good points for business travellers include dedicated check in section and priority baggage loading and unloading. The lie-flat seats are ok (between Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul) and the food is ok. If you are looking for a true business class experience, I would highly recommend paying a bit more and going with another airline.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,686,Couple Leisure,IST to MAN,January 2016,Boeing 737,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

But on the way back it was one of the mot horrific experience I had had. We checked in on time as per the rules from Mumbai. The flight was delayed by more than 3 hours. We inquired with he ground staff will we get the connecting flight to Houston from Istanbul, and they said yes. So we were on the way to Istanbul. The flight arrived late. There was nobody at the gate to let us know what we should be doing as your flight connections are not there. We went through the security again and by the time we reached the gate for Houston, they had closed the gate. When inquired with the person there he said gate closed now you go and look yourself what to do. We had no clue where to go. We went inquiring all over the airport, and the people or the staff there kept us sending up and down and left and right. In the end we saw a counter and we stood in that line at least to get in touch with someone authentic to talk to. The lady did not speak proper English, but somehow we got out boarding pass done for the flight for the next day. Now the problem starts, we asked the lady for or hotel stay as we have not missed the flight due to our negligence, but it was due to the airlines mess up. She said go to the hotel counter, but to get there we had to pass through passport control and we needed visa. So we had to pay for the visa which was not acceptable to us, because by now we had lost faith in the staff and the people around. So me and wife decided to stay put at the airport, not realizing the it was snowing and we will get shivery in the night.

We were to get a flight from Athens to Istanbul around 22:05 and then a connecting flight to Nairobi from Istanbul on 00:55. Much to our surprise when we reach at Athens airport at around 6:00om we came to know that the flight has been canceled. When I asked why we have not informed on the number we have mentioned on the ticket they declined to answer and asked us to get into a flight which was scheduled at 7pm. I was travelling with my wife and my 2.5 years daughter we actually had to run for check-in, security check, immigration etc as airline staff asked us to rush to get into the flight. Finally we reached to the gate but flight started after 8:30pm. We could not understand why we had been rushed for the formalities with a small baby. When we reached Istanbul, we have been informed that flight is late and eventually it was announced with the gate around 3:40am. We got into the bus and we had been taken to the aircraft but we had not been allowed to go out of the bus for almost 45 mins. Later on we had been taken back to the terminal and asked to wait. When we asked for the reason first they said that the Nairobi Airport is closed due to heavy snow fall which was an utter lie and later on the staff informed us that there is no Crew for the aircraft and it will take some time. We waited at the terminal without any assistance from anyone, sitting on the floor with the baby till 11am,  and then they announced that flight has been cancelled and asked us to contact transfer desk. At transfer desk we had been given the new boarding passes and had been asked that next flight will be 0050 in the night which mean the whole day. I requested to give us some assistance as we have a baby and its very cold, but they refused to assist me in any way and later on just asked me to go away from the counter which was very rude. Later I took my own visa and booked the hotel by myself to go out so that we can have some rest. Later on next day when we landed at Nairobi all of our baggage were missing and there were no information. I had to follow-up with airport authorities and Turkish Airlines office daily to get my bags on the 6th after 4 days. The airport staff did not have normal empathy.

There were no staff at the arrival gate to direct passengers or offer assistance to more elderly people who couldn't run (unlike ourselves- if we hadn't sprinted we wouldn't have made the next flight).

No information was provided from the Turkish Airline Staff, and finally when the plane took off and landed in Istanbul, we had to wait another 2 hours for the plane to be allowed to park.

More than 1500 passengers were jammed around the counter. There was not even one airport, security or airline staff to organize people and ask them to stand in line.

They wanted to get rid of me by making me enter Turkey (through passport control) and go to check-in terminal, so that I am not their problem any more! I had no other choice, so I followed their advice. The Sales Office line was a nightmare. The line stretched all along the Ataturk Airport check-in Terminal.

This is not surprising as it was the early hours of the morning and people were tired. Any decent airline would have put on extra staff and kept people updated. They would have identified elderly passengers and people with young children and provided them with special service. I was in neither of these categories but would have understood the need. What I would not have understood was why it seemed Turkish passengers able to speak the language were frequently being given special treatment and allowed to jump the line. I was stood in this queue for 4 hours and not once did I see anyone that vaguely looked in charge. It was atrocious. But no one from Turkish Airlines seemed very bothered. Whilst TK might be cheap, you clearly get what you pay for! A lesson learned for me. TK claims to be one of the best airlines in Europe.

I was then directed outside of the airport by a police officer and had to go back through security to get back in. I joined the 6 hour queue at Turkish Airlines desk and managed to get another flight 2 days later. I then had to join the Supervisor queue then the hotel queue and finally put up at a hotel.

Out of those flights, half of them were on time with the other half were delayed by about an hour -  only one had a four hour delay because of weather. As long as everything goes right, TK is a pretty good airline, but as soon as something goes wrong, their disaster management is a disaster itself and as a passenger you're usually left with no information about what's going on. Besides that, ground services are pretty slow as well and sometimes you're waiting for more than half an hour at the luggage belt. Seats on the narrowbody fleet are mostly okay while those on the A330s are pretty uncomfortable (didn't try the B777 so far). Turkish Airlines inflight catering is excellent and oustanding compared to most other airlines. When changing planes either at Atatürk or Sabiha Gökcen airport, allow yourself some extra connecting time as flights are often a bit delayed and baggage handling and immigration (for domestic connections) sometimes takes ages. That extra time also increases the chance your luggage will make it on the connecting flight too.

I can't sit for very long and had to get up a few times and there was very little leg room to stretch my legs, my knees were almost touching the seat in front of me and I am not the tallest guy under 6'. Entertainment system was nice though, nice big screen with a lot of variety, the earbuds the airline provided are terrible for fitting, so just use yours with the adapter they provide. Touch screen is a little annoying as they don't have the best accuracy. One of the few airlines that provide care package that includes slippers, socks, ear plugs, toothbrush and paste, wich is really nice. If you have little kids they will come around prior to take off with little baggies for them. Plane was clean overall, and the crew were overall very nice although English is not the best, making it hard to understand at times. Food was hit and miss. The main meal was decent, the dessert was great. Our next flight after this was from Istanbul to Lahore and the seating was roomier thats for sure. I think I would have enjoyed the flight more if not for the 4 hour layover that was compounded with a 4 hour delay with another 2 hour delay on the tarmac. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were nice once again. The food was again hit and miss as this time the main meal was not so great, dessert was nice though. Also whats nice is that you can ask for a sandwhich or dessert anytime during the flight or get up and go the the kitchen area and they have water or juice ready for you. Coming back,  again the planes were clean and cabin crew were nice.  Entertainment system was working all the way through. No delays at the airport this time.

Check in went fine. The flight was fine. I had a layover in Istanbul and then on to Rome. I got to Rome and had no luggage. I was told it was left in Istanbul. The form was filled out and I was told they would deliver it to me either the next day or the day after that. This made me nervous as we were leaving for a cruise 4 days after my arrival in Rome. I didn't hear anything the first day. I tried to call them all through the second day and it was constantly busy, so I emailed them. They responded and said they did not have my luggage. I emailed every day and got the same reply every day for four days until we left on the cruise. Everything I needed for that cruise was in that bag - all the formal gowns, shoes, purses, etc. Once onboard the ship, they also tried to contact Turkish Airlines, but were not given any type of response. I called the airline during the cruise. I was told my claim had been closed and that my luggage had been delivered. When I questioned them about this as I had not received my luggage, they stopped responding to me. I called again and they told me to call a different number which I did. In the end, I was told to call four different numbers before they told me to call back to the original number. Each time I was told they could not help me. When I returned to Rome 16 days later, I went to the airport to try and find my luggage. After a considerable amount of time, they found it. A bit too late, however. Not having my luggage meant my daughter and I could not attend the three formal gala nights on the ship - the thing we were most looking forward to. Although we tried not to let the situation ruin the cruise, it definitely was not the vacation we had hoped for. For my return flight, Turkish Airlines cancelled the first flight and rebooked me on a flight four hours later. They caused me to miss my connecting flight. They were not concerned about my second leg, although it was booked on their airline. When I pushed them to get me home, they ended up booking me on British Airways. When I asked about compensation for the 1500 euros I had to spend on clothes, toiletries, etc, I was told sorry, fill out a form and someone will probably get back to you.

It got to the point where the man who put me through security had to come and calm her down. Incompetent in the fact that the new flight they put me on had a 7 hour layover in Istanbul. The check in person, promised my bag would go to Munich, which of course it didn’t - when I finally arrived in Munich and talked to the representative about my missing baggage, she said that since I was flying back to Minneapolis the next day instead of sending my bag to Munich they would just send it to Minneapolis, than have it delivered to my house, which was a lie. When I tried to track my luggage once I was home it didn’t work. I called their customer service, who to be extremely kind, are inadequate at all and any part of their job, to try to locate my bag. The gentleman stated my bag arrived in Minneapolis on Sunday, it was lost on a Friday, and that it should be shipped to my house tomorrow. The next day comes and still no bag so I call back. The man tells me that my bag just passed customs and they have 24 hours to deliver it to me. I wait two days before calling back, quite annoyed at this point. The man I talked to this time tells me my bag went to Munich and that’s all he can see. So I let him know that other customer service staff I talked to were able to find out much more and he should get better at his job. He was than able to see my bag came to the US through Icelandair and is in MSP airport. I told him that everyone I’ve talked to has said it will be shipped to my house and when I would be able to expect it. He said they don’t work with any delivery company in the US and that he isn’t able to give me any more information. So when I asked him what I was supposed to do about getting my bag back and he responded with “I don’t know”, I don’t think he was ready for the reaction he got. After showing him my frustration he was then able to locate the airline that my bag got to Minneapolis with and gave me their phone number. I called the airline and sure enough my bag had been sitting in their office all week.

I booked a flight via a travel web site to fly with Turkish Airlines in May 2016. Three days after receiving confirmation from the travel web site I checked the Turkish Airlines web site to see if I could choose my seats. The airline booking number given to me showed my reservations were cancelled. I checked my credit card and saw a charge of $824 for one ticket on my account and a pending charge of $3000 for the other 3 tickets purchased. I called the travel web site immediately since I know I am supposed to deal with them first. The rep for the travel web site contacted Turkish Airlines and kept me on hold for over an hour while he spoke with reservation agents and supervisors. Nobody could tell us exactly what happened or why. The agents simply stated the reservation was cancelled by the airline for some unknown reason. However, the reservation agents stated I would still be charged the full price for all four tickets as the tickets were non-refundable. Talk about unethical business practice. The airline screws up, cancels my booking without my consent or knowledge, and then charges me almost $4000. I understand charging the full price on a non-refundable ticket if the purchaser chooses to cancel, but how can the airline make that decision without any reason? The Turkish Airlines agent said nothing could be done on his end to rectify or correct the situation and that the travel web site agent would have to call a corporate sales office to work something out if it was possible. Mind you, nobody is saying I will get the situation taken care of. They are only saying I may be able to get the situation taken care of if I talk to the right people. I called Turkish Airlines myself the next day and was told the same thing: IF the situation can be fixed I would only be able to do so with the permission of the higher ups. When I asked for contact information for the corporate offices I was told to, ""look it up on the Internet and find it on my own."" Awesome customer service - just kidding. I did look up and call all of the corporate sales offices listed. None of them even put me through to a person. One had me on hold after the automated menu for 15 minutes and cut me off. Another simply had an auto message that stated, ""We cannot take your call. Goodbye."" And the others just rang. Realizing I may not resolve the issue before the pending charge of $3000 went through and a lot of time/red tape I promptly contacted my credit card company and explained the situation. The credit card company contacted Turkish Airlines and were given the same IFs and MAYs, so the credit card company went ahead and refunded me the $824 and promised to block the $3000 or refund it immediately if it went through before they could stop it.

It started on arrival in Addis on Dec 20th, none of our 5 bags had made it, it turned out that due to a change of plane there was not enough space in the hold and they had left most of them behind in Istanbul. Had to go back to the aiport the next day to get the bags, fortunately they were all there. Then on the way back our flight to Istanbul had a delay of more than 3 hours. We all boarded but then had to sit on the tarmac for 1.5 hours because they had to unload half of the luggage and told us it would arrive later. Of course we missed the connection in Istanbul and were greeted with total chaos due to the fact that extremely light snow had fallen. We had to queue for 4 hours together with hundreds of other people, no water, no food, many very angry people and no help whatsoever from any Turkish Airlines staff. To make a long story short: only because I insisted on getting on a flight that day were we lucky enough to be put on a flight to Amsterdam (not Brussels) which departed in total chaos as well. Many people were stranded for more than one night. We arrived in Amsterdam with 14 hours delay and no luggage. This was delivered to us after 5 days. Service on board this time was a lot less as well, IFE was not working or was not there at all, food was not as tasty and it was a very old plane on the leg to and from Addis. Next time I fly to Addis I will use another airline.

Boarding completed and the gate was closed around 10.45. Normally this route is only 50 minutes. There was severe snow in Ankara. The aircraft has waited nearly two hours before take-off. Two hours later gave the news the flight had been cancelled. The passengers were requested to wait in the aircraft till it boards the gate. However 40 minutes after the announcement of cancellation, we heard another announcement that the aircraft perform its flight, however certain passengers declared that they do not want to fly, so the aircraft will wait till they leave and then perform the flight - the cancellation decision has been cancelled. Certain passengers left the aircraft voluntarily. Those who opted to fly waited till their luggage be removed. The following surprise was, the aircraft accepted new passengers once certain passengers left and their luggages removed. The newcomers luggage loaded in Cargo. Then another announcement ""Those passengers Who do not want to fly may get off"". A second wave of passengers left the aircraft and their luggages removed. The total delay has been 6 hours. Two consecutive flights on the same ESB-IST route after our TK2127 have been performed with 60-90 minutes delay. Snow is not sufficient to explain the reason of such delay. The cabin crew was really helpful and they served water, food, beverages with a pleasure. However Turkish Airlines failed the crisis management. The cabin crew performed the security demonstration three times because the aircraft was incoming new passengers as some other passengers preferred not to fly and leave. I had an intercontinental flight with KLM departing from Istanbul and I could tolerate 6 hours delay maximum, unfortunately I lost my intercontinental flight. A delay over 6 hours was out of my imagination. If the flight had been cancelled, I would not submit any complain and acccept the situation.

There was no info about the connecting flight to Stuttgart for which there would be only 1/2 h to get it. Back in KTM we learned that we'd have to stay the night in IST. We managed to get a flight a day earlier, thus at least making up for the time loss. The flight was very pleasant. But info and service on arrival that evening in IST was appalling. We had to find our own way through the airport, no signs and not knowing where to report for the hotel supplied by the airline. After standing in line for the passport controll we were told we need a visa, so we had to go back to another counter and pay 50 USD for a visa. When, finally finding the counter for the hotel, there was another long lineup and and afterwards we sat waiting for a shuttle. The hotel was 10 min away, very nice and we got a late supper around 22:30. The food was disappointing. Next morning, without breakfast, we had to shuttle back to the airport at 5 in the morning for a 9:30 flight. We were through security and passport controlls by 5:30, the gate wasn't announced until 8:20 and only then we were able to go and sit. All these are things that happen when travelling. But what annoys me to no end is that the airline refuses to refund our visa fee. What makes it worse is the reason given: we supposedly acknowledged the delay when we altered out flight, flying a day earlier. I suppose we did acknowledge the delay -2 hrs is nothing - but we certainly did not acknowledge additional expenses. The downtown airline office in STG does not deal with customer complaints and is not helpful in any way. The same applies to the airport office. My request then forwarded to IST was first returned because it was in German. For every message to IST one has to jump all the hoops on their website and over and over again fill out the forms.

The lady who attended me at the check-in counter first gave me the boarding tickets putting me and my family in sequential seats in the same row (51). But before she gave me the boarding tickets, she decided to talk to another attendant and after that she decided to reprint the tickets putting us in totally different seats. Note: one of the passengers was my daughter and she is just 1.5 years old! I tried several times to explain to the check-in lady that I was flying with my daughter and at least the father or the mother must travel together with her – I bought a seat for her just to provide better accommodation and to not bother the other passengers. But she became angry and arrogant, just told me that I would have to solve this “problem” by myself with the gate staff or even with the flight attendants, or even ask people in the airplane to change the seats with me. So in summary the problem was created by Turkish Airlines and I would have to solve it by myself. At that time, I started to be angry with the arrogance and incompetence of the check-in staff, starting with the point that is simply unacceptable to have people working for Turkish Airlines in the International check-in desk who are not fluent in English – without mentioning that they simply ignored the fact that a 1.5 years-old baby would fly alone with the insane arrangement this lady provided me at the check-in desk. Well, still following the instructions gave to me by the check-in lady, two other ladies who were working at the gate simply ignored my requirements. Only after I had to yell to one of that women, she told me (with a very angry face that she could not help me and I would have to solve this problem by myself inside the plane. When the gate was released for embarking, another employee required and took over my tickets and asked me and my family to wait outside the finger. We waited about 20 minutes and when almost all passengers entered into the plane, another employee gave me the tickets back and said that I would have to solve the problem by myself. At that time, I was fed up with the arrogance of  employees who forced me to wait 20 minutes for nothing, and once I entered into the plane I had to start to yell in order to be attended by the chief of flight attendants, who had the courage to propose my wife to hold my daughter in the same seat, giving away to another passenger the extra seat that we bought.

By the time I had got through security,the departure board was showing a 35 minute delay.  Was able to use the Clubroom Business Lounge in South Terminal and it was fine though very crowded. It did however provide a fine ,clear view of the single runway at Gatwick so after about 30 minutes there, was able to see the aircraft queuing for take off turn around and make their way back to the departure gates. This was followed by a display of a wide variety of emergency vehicles who proceeded to spray the runway in an attempt to clean up a fuel or oil spill. For about an hour nothing moved though no announcements were made in the lounge. Eventually, we boarded the flight and just sat there for about 45 minutes. The Captain kept us advised as take off was put back yet another 10 minutes though there was at no time any apology for the delay. Eventually took off well over two hours late and as I had 80 minutes to make my onward connection in Istanbul had the flight been on time, I realised I might have problems. Spoke to the purser during the flight who explained that Istanbul had experienced fog that morning. She added that as so many passengers on board were connecting to Bangkok, the onward flight would be held for us. Rather stupidly, I believed her. Flight was uneventful and service, seat comfort fine but after we landed at Istanbul, we taxied for about 20 minutes and were then bussed into the terminal. Despite the delay, no Turkish Airlines staff met the arriving passengers and the airport was chaotic. Eventually, I found an airline staff member who said my connnection was missed and telling me to go to the transfer desk. I found this and was concerned to see long queues. After about an hour I manged to attract the attention of a Turkish Airlines official and asked whether premium class passengers were expected to be treated like this whereupon he told me I had been directed to the wrong transfer desk. I found the business class transfer area and after a short wait was told I had been transferred onto a flight leaving at 0045, 6 hours after my planned departure time. By the time I got to the Turkish Airlines lounge my new flight was also showing a delay of an hour though the staff at the desk warned me it could be longer. The Lounge was so crowded. My onward flight to Bangkok was delayed by just an hour and again there was no apology or explanation. The flight was fine with a standard business lie flat seat.

The entertainment was excellent, food was delicious, toilets were maintained and kept clean to a high standard and the staff were superb. However on the last leg of the journey, from Istanbul to London, we were very disappointed with the aircraft itself.

But the staff were exceptional and did their best to cater for us, ensuring the children were comfortable. Overall, we enjoyed flying on Turkish Airlines.

As I am a UK citizen, I frequently fly between Manchester, UK and Batumi, Georgia via Istanbul Ataturk. I have made bookings for three trips between Batumi and Istanbul over the last three months and I have to say the performance of the airline on this route is shockingly poor. On 29 December 2015, my flight from Istanbul to Batumi was cancelled. Weather conditions at Batumi were blamed. I was offered an alternative flight to Trabzon, Turkey instead being told there would be a bus transfer to Batumi. On arrival at Trabzon, there was no information about a bus transfer and no-one seemed to have clue about what to do. Eventually, I managed to find someone who put me on a bus (it was obvious this had not been arranged to cater for the disruption) which then left meet at the Georgian border at Sarpi. I was then forced to make my own travel arrangements from there. On 24 February 2016 my flight from Batumi to Istanbul was cancelled. Once again weather conditions were blamed. Today (24 March) my flight from Batumi to Istanbul has again been cancelled with weather conditions at Istanbul Ataturk airport being blamed. However, on checking the Turkish Airlines website, it was noted that other international flights are recorded as having landed at this airport at around the same time my own was due to land. My work colleagues have also experienced similar disruptions and cancellations to their flights over the last three months (some of their experiences were even worse!). The flight between Istanbul and Batumi is supposed to be a scheduled daily flight. However, the level of disruption leads many of us working here in Georgia to believe the airline does not value its customers and can just cancel flights when it wishes if it believes it does not have enough passengers - with weather conditions being blamed as a way to avoid having to pay compensation.

I have travelled with Turkish Airlines some times the past year, and it seems there is always is some sort of mishap - delays, technical problems with the entertainment system, booking of seats that doesn't exist etc. However, my past trip with made me wonder if they have heard of the term ""customer service"". I had booked their website. The trip passed through Istanbul with one hour waiting time. At 2am the day before my trip (ie. 34 hours before departure) I received an email (and email only) that my flight to Istanbul was 5 hours delayed, but there were no information about my flight from Istanbul, so I called customer service. It turned out that my flight had been cancelled, and that I had been shifted on a later flight, but Turkish hadn't thought about what effects that had on my flight from Istanbul. The initial thought of the customer service was that I had to stay overnight at Istanbul, and then take the flight the next day. There is only 1 flight from Istanbul to my destination every day, so that meant that I were facing a 24 hours delay and that I would have to wait until 6pm before my flight departed. When I told the customer service that this was not doable, he said that there were seats available on the flight to Istanbul on an earlier flight ( departure 7.30a, instead of noon), but that there were only business class seats left and that I had to upgrade my ticket. That is of course not acceptable. After 32 minutes on the phone with customer service, I got booked on to that earlier flight (giving me an 5 hours additional wait in Istanbul, but at least not a 24 hour delay to my arrival time). When I boarded that flight, I was seated in one of the economy seats that were supposed to be unavailable, and it also turned out that there were plenty of free seats on economy class. What kind of customer service is this? Unfortunately I had another horrible experience with Turkish on my flight back, where I were denied to check-in because I met up at the airport 52 minutes before departure instead of the required 60 minutes. There were no problems in assisting the business class passenger who arrived at the same time as me, but I was rejected because of these 8 minutes. I have never been late on check-in before, but I have seen many exemples of airline companies bending over backwards to help their passengers (especially if it was the last flight for the day, or in this case the only).

Istanbul Ataturk Airport is presently a disaster, even for business class. It's overcrowded and business lounge difficult to find. The A340 to CPT obviously had been an ""outgoing model"". We boarded 2 hours late from the maintenance hangar - but arrived only one hour late in CPT. The worst were the seats. Although they nearly fully recline, the foot-rests do not hold up, which makes sleeping economy-class like. The fatigued upholstery was improved by sleeping-bag like covers provided by the crew. The worst had to come on the return leg from Cape-Town: the entertainment system on my seat had no sound and could not be fixed. Service and food had been good business class standard.

2016-04-13,"""disappointing and unrefined experience""",3,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Turkish Airlines from Cape Town to Istanbul via Durban. ​Boarding: No boarding music, no pre-departure champagne offered (must be requested), no nuts/snacks offered with drinks (must be requested). Cabin/seat: dull grey cabin with no special lighting effects/mood lighting/flowers etc, rather dated business class seat in 2-2-2 layout, broken tray table storage mechanism meant my table protruded into seat area for 14 hours - especially uncomfortable when attempting to sleep. Technician attempted but failed to repair it during the stopover in Durban. Service: service from Cape Town was minimalist, but following a replacement crew in Durban things improved slightly. Nevertheless timing was too often off - starters and main courses were served but no accompanying wine offered (requested), it took over three hours to serve and clear a relatively small business cabin before lights were turned off, then switched on (not even gradually) 2.5 hours before landing for a quick breakfast service accomplished in an hour which left passengers bleary eyed and waiting for landing. A rather persistent cabin crew member insisted I and the passenger next to me raise our seat backs to almost 90 degrees forty minutes before landing (most decent airlines show some discretion is this regard until nearing final approach). Entertainment: limited selection of movies and TV shows, no WiFi/connectivity. Due to system issues it was reset at least twice en-route, unavailable for ten minutes each time, and meant having to fast-forward through films to the point at which it had been turned off. Arrival: parked at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal on arrival in Istanbul, found the spacious and well appointed Turkish Airlines lounge but waiting time for a shower was two hours. Opted to queue for a toilet. ​All-in all a rather disappointing and unrefined experience, relieved not to have paid for this trip myself, and wouldn't recommend Turkish Business Class when other (in particular Gulf) airlines offer a far better long-haul product.

2016-04-14,"""there is no customer service""",3,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to New York via Istanbul. I have nostalgic affection for Turkish, and have flown them many times from Istanbul to New York - their Premium Economy on that route is one of the great bargains of air travel. Their Business product is another matter, though it has its good points. I flew it long haul from Bangkok to New York with mixed results. The A330 is small and cramped, especially if you are used to flying the A380 with Emirates, say. Cathay also fly this plane, however, and they herringbone the seats to give you privacy. No such luck with Turkish. The 2-2-2 configuration means you are either next to someone snoring with no divider - and no privacy whatsoever - or you are constantly leaping over someones legs to get to the bathroom. The cabin felt claustrophobic and hot for this reason. Food is superb and yes I love the little candles! Service is also professional and smiling and wines are high quality. Inflight entertainment is pretty mediocre : small screens, not much choice and low-brow movie selection. As is quite common with Turkish, my connection with New York was missed and when I arrived in Istanbul there was zero help from ground staff. I was just left to fend for myself. Appointments for the following day in NY duly cancelled, I struggled for four hours to get out of the airport with my (temporarily misplaced) bags and get a hotel voucher (vast line, an offer for a three star hotel). Not a Business class experience, to say the least. The limitations of Istanbul airport are not the fault of Turkish, of course, but the airline needs to seriously rethink its ground operations in the event of transit mishaps, especially as they are so common that I now hesitate about doing any connections in Istanbul. I arrived in NY the next day in a pretty bad mood. Coming back, boarding at JFK was like a rugby scrum, with no priority boarding and no organization. Stress all the way. All in all, Turkish Airlines try hard to make the on-bard experience friendly and gastronomically coddling which one has to appreciate, But for several thousands dollars I think I'll be flying a Far Eastern or Gulf airline next time - the product is just so much better and more logistically sophisticated.  As many others have noted here, there is no customer service and so your little complaint will go entirely ignored, as mine was. In the future, I will use Turkish for short haul flights in Economy because they fly to alot of places and are good value for money.

There's warm bread and I've eaten more hummus on those four flights than I have in my life. The new A330s have a great entertainment system, with a nice multi-touch display, live TV, and wi-fi (purchase necessary). The slightly older A330 going from IST to CDG also had an older touchscreen display but was a bit unresponsive to input. The actual movies and TV shows were the same regardless of the hardware and so it was easy to overlook the hardware troubles. There is decent legroom although you start to feel a little claustrophobic once the person in front of you reclines back.

Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served. It was a cardboard box containing a sandwich, salad and a mousse which was not as good as Egyptair hot food offering on the same route and not what one expects for the amount of money paid for the flight.

2016-05-11,"""will definitely book again""",8,"✅ Verified Review | London Gatwick to Mombasa with Turkish Airlines. TK currently have rock-bottom fares (around £1300 return to MBA from LGW). Arrival / departure times are inconvenient which may be a contributing factor. TK use the new Number 1 lounge at LGW. The ‘onboard chef’ on TK flights is a lot of fuss about nothing. The ‘chef’ on the first short sector to IST is simply a flight attendant in a chef’s hat who serves the drinks and most of the food. There was no chef on the long-haul sector. The food offering was excellent on both flights. There is a Turkish flair to the menu (Mezze, Turkish coffee, Turkish wines), however there is enough to choose from to please the less adventurous palate. The seat is clearly the reason that the lower fares are currently offered on the route. The seats are not flatbed. They are similar to most airline’s Premium Economy seat offer. Good leg-room, a foot rest and good recline. Other than that a normal medium haul business class seat. If I was paying the fare BA or KQ charge on the route I would have something to grumble about, but I am not – so did not. Everyone talks about the lounge at IST. It certainly is large, and impressive with self-service bars throughout, deli-style counters with sweets, cakes and savoury options. The pizza chefs, BBQ chefs, pasta chefs cook for the streams of passengers queuing for them. There is a virtual golf range, scalextric track to ‘play’ with in addition to cinemas, pool tables and a huge library. There are massage therapists with whom you can book an in-seat massage too - but order this early as waiting times can be long. The thing is, the lounge is so big you tend to sit in one spot where you find a seat (there are no ‘quiet areas’, just lots of seats and tables dotted around). It’s big and brash (like the network and advertising for it), and I will go back – but it’s not ‘special’. The staff were also not especially welcoming. Questions about availability of yoghurt for example was met with a disinterested, “I don’t know – look over there”. There was no feeling of being a special guest. It felt more like we were being done a favour by being allowed into the lounge – now we must fend for ourselves. Even if you are not travelling in business class, IST is a fab transit point. Excellent shops, restaurants and bars. Both my wife and I said it will be our preferred transit stop, whichever class we travel in future. Signage could be improved and the information points were staffed were not interested in offering any form of ‘customer service’. The one time we asked for directions we were answered with grunts and a tired ‘nod’ in the direction we should go. I would hesitate letting anyone transit alone who was unsure about how to get around an airport (elderly parent etc.), simply because of the lack of genuine help available by the staff on duty. The service of the flight to Kenya was equally good with nice choices from the menu. The presentation could do with some work – meals brought out from the galley wrapped in foil (from an airline boasting top cuisine and a chef?) which is unceremoniously unwrapped in front of you. Turkish coffee was made from instant powder in full view of the cabin before being served (nicely) with Turkish delight. This was a little disappointing. Overall, a good product at an excellent price. The food service is good and transit process reasonably easy for frequent travellers.

Food and entertainment were on par with other carriers. But when things go wrong, TK falls apart. A technical fault delayed my flight back from Berlin. Initially, the delay was announced to be 90 minutes, meaning many passengers would miss connections in IST, including myself. The fate of transit passengers was left to the transfer desk in IST, as TXL ground staff refused to do anything. This was extremely nerve-racking because my connecting flight to SIN operated only daily, so I would have had to stay overnight in IST if I missed it. When I explained the situation and asked to be re-booked from TXL, ground staff rejected my request, and said they could do nothing nor provide any information on my connecting flight. Several transit passengers were frustrated over the lack of answers resulting in arguments with ground staff. There were further delays during boarding, and no explanations or revised departure time was provided. Eventually, the flight left 2.5 hours  late. In IST, transfer desk said SIN flight was over 4 hours late. Why couldn’t the ground staff in TXL tell me this? We were also told there were food vouchers at the ironically labeled “care point”, staffed by rude employees who spoke poor English. There were no food vouchers; just a free Burger King meal consisting of cheeseburgers and fries if we presented our boarding passes. The Burger King was about to close but our requests were still entertained – initially. However, other passengers cut the queue, finishing the food. The employees refused to cook more because they had to close. IST, while filled with shops and restaurants, is overcrowded and has some of the filthiest washrooms I've seen at any major airport. At the gate, no reasons were provided for delay, and agents only appeared just before boarding.

Business class with the A320 is your luck of the draw, on one of the 3 flights in this aircraft type business class was simply an economy seat with the middle seat left empty as is the case with European airlines. This is unfair to passengers who are paying a lot of money only to end up in an economy seat, on the A330 it is a completely different experience with a massive seat, tons of privacy and space an altogether different experience.

Upon taking my seat and checking out the IFE I found that the Map screen wasn't working at all, which was another disappointment, I'd seen one person call the flight attendant asking her the same thing. The entertainment, meaning the music and movie selection was good but not great. Nothing that was particularly new. We were given Turkish Delight as soon as all the passengers were settled down - it was A nice unique touch to their service. The flight attendants were dressed smartly and were attentive, however, looked moody and tired. The food service was brilliant. I chose the pasta option and it was very good. The side dishes accompanying it were very good also. Their Homemade Lemonade with Mint was really refreshing. The flight was proceeding ahead as normal until we landed and were at the gate ready to disembark the aircraft. We were told to take our seat's because the airport authorities wouldn't let us off. We were not aware of the issues at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. The crew didn't mention it to us but people slowly started to find out. We were held on the plane for 6 hours, without any food - water was available but the crew had run out of cups which made it difficult for people to stay hydrated. After disembarking the plane via stairs, we were rushed off into Terminal Buses to take us to the airport entrance, once it was safe. By this time it was 2am and I had missed my connecting flight. It was canceled due to the incident - all flights were. The amount of stranded passengers in the terminal was overwhelming, and to see that no Turkish Airlines staff were there to assist us with the queries we all had was shocking. In incidents like these, when these things happen staff should be there to assist with the backlog of passengers. I ended up waiting until 9am for the information desk to open to re-book my flight to Seoul. When I finally got on the flight to Seoul, the service was immaculate. Everything worked and the flight was great. We were given Turkish Delight and Hot Towels, including complimentary amenity kits and a menu which clearly stated what the meal options were. Snacks anytime you wanted and the flight attendants regularly came with drinks to keep everyone quenched. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly and it was generally a pleasurable flight. The only thing I'd say having been on two flights was that I felt we were being treated like royalty on the longer long haul flights and less attended to on the shorter ones i.e London to Istanbul - we didn't get hot towels or much attention. Overall their in-flight service is very good, food is top notch, however, their ground staff could do with more training in customer management.

Moreover, Turkish Airlines lounge is free of charge for business class passengers. The seats in the business class are wide and comfortable with ability to transform a seat to bed-like resting position. The in-flight entertainment is wonderful - from many new movies, channels, series, etc. Inflight service is excellent with very attentive flight attendants. The meal service was simply fantastic - bext to appetizers, there is a selection of 3 possible main course choices (but I did not like any of them (veal, shrimp, vegetarian), so I was offered extra choice of chicken - to my own surprise).

On both ways, there was IFE with a large choice of different international movies and documentaries. Never seen this before on an A321 or/and on short-haul. The flight time was enough to watch one movie. However, When you watched a movie and had your earphones on, the cabin announcements were so loud. Food was delicious. At first you get a turkish delight. For the meal, you could choose between Turkish meat-balls and something with chicken. I had the meat-balls which was great. Alcoholic drinks were free. I took a beer and a freshly squeezed orange juice. The staff were nice. Seat comfort is ok. I'm 5ft. 10in. I had enough space to the front and for my legs. The space to my neighbour was fine.

We landed normally on time, July 15th, 11pm in Istanbul for a short transfer for the next flight - but that was not to be. Leaving the plane we noticed there was no personnel from Turkish Airlines to be seen. After walking around looking for the gate for the connecting flight we started to feel something was wrong. And it was. The airport was closed (we were the last flight in) and the military coup was in progress. Since there was absolutely no information coming from the airport or Turkish Airlines personnel we had to rely on rumors and twitter to discover what was going on. In short order, here are the events as they unfolded: No personnel from Turkish Airlines was to be seen or heard from in any form from 11pm July 15th until 2pm July 16. They left thousands of transit passengers stranded without food, water or information. No information whatsoever was at any time given to us before the following day 2pm. The transfer desk and information desk was at all times left unmanned. After 14 hours my flight was cancelled. Over the speakers we were given the option to either travel to Turkish Airlines HQ in Istanbul city centre, or call their call center (all lines busy). It was complete chaos.

2016-08-14,"""the lack of leg room""",4,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew from Los Angeles to Geneva via Istanbul. Flight from LAX to IST was full and while the catering, inflight entertainment and cabin staff service were good, the impression that remained from this flight was the lack of leg room for such a long haul flight. I'm 1m 80 and my wife 1m 76, which has nothing exceptional in the European population and despite having removed all brochures from the seat pockets in front of us, our knees in a normal seating position were touching the seats in front of us (that were not even inclined). We battled during this 12h30 flight to find the most confortable position without success. A real pity that TK accomodate maximum seats in Economy despite very good 9 seats abreast configuration on this 777-300 (vs 10 for many other airlines). Like many European travelers, we have been attracted to Turkish Airlines by their competitive prices (around 50% cheaper than AF, BA, LH, LX when we booked to the ticket early April), their enviable reputation of Best European Airline by Skytrax for several years in a row and their staff reliability (no strikes recorded during the last few years compare to AF/LH for instance). Transit via IST was OK while extremely crowded highlighting again the dramatic need for TK to operate from the new airport under construction. Flight from IST to GVA was fine (A320) without leg room issues).

As we arrive at the airport we learn all flights to USA have been cancelled again. We go to the ticket sales where a woman finds us a new flight from Istanbul to Frankfurt and a Lufhtansa flight from Frankfurt to LAX, the day after again. One more night in Istanbul. At the check-in counter I'm told they can't check us in for both flights, ""Because we are two different companies"". They say we have to get the luggage back in Frankfurt and check-in again with Lufthansa. Luggage is not in Frankfurt, I ask for information at the baggage claim and they explain to me when luggage is in transit it's kept in transit 'til the final destination. We move to the departures terminal and check-in again, but there's no seat number on the boarding pass. As we arrive at the gate we find out that the Turkish Airlines employee had jut put us on a waiting list. Boarding refused. We go back to the TK ticket sales and after two hours they manage to find us a new flight for the day after. We ask for our luggage, as we have been wearing the same clothes for 3 days and we find out the luggage is not in Frankfurt at all, as it's been never loaded on our flight from Ataturk. We make a claim (fortunately the German personnel is far more professional than the personnel in Ataturk). They say the luggage will be sent to LAX with the next flight from Ataturk. The day after we finally fly to LAX with a LH flight. Luggage is not there. Another claim, they say to come back the day after because TK made another mistake and sent the luggage to Frankfurt.

We sat on the plane on the tarmac for two and a bit hours because they lost an oxygen tank and couldn't find a new one. They then cancelled our flight and stuck us back in the terminal. Then the heavens opened. Obviously the best option was to stick 200 grumpy passengers outside in the thunder, lightning and rain. Next, they took us 4 at a time in taxis to an hotel. My wife and I were put into what appeared to be the remnant of a much hated Toyota Corrolla. We hung out there for a bit with a guy who spoke no English whatsoever. Once he left us alone in his car and we realised we were going nowhere we accosted a man with a Turkish airlines jacket in a dark car park (still raining). He put us on a bus which proceeded to tour Niamey at 3:00am with the AC on full blast which helped our wet cloths become much more effective in helping us contract some illness. Finally after messing about for a total 6 hours, at 4:00am we got a hotel which makes faulty towers look like New York's Waldorf hotel. There we were left in the hands of the  Receptionist. What he lacked linguist ability and clarity of speech he made for in volume and repetition. Needless to say information about our fate was lacking. At around around 7:30am a rumour spread that our suffering may end by 8:00pm that evening. Finally at 8:00pm we were herded into a bus and taken to the airport. There, the Turkish Airlines staff directed us to line up and walk around Niamey airport. At the departure gate our boarding passes and baggage tags were handed out.

So I got the flight to Istanbul but the situation I found at the airport was terrible. A lot of flights were cancelled. I found out that my flight to SFO was delayed by 5 hours, so I went to the gate and waited there.

I went out of the airport but my luggage was not in the baggage carrousel. I went to the hotel desk and they asked everybody there to enter in a bus and we were taken to a hotel. There a Turkish Airlines staff told me that my luggage will be delivered to the hotel and that my flight to SFO was confirmed to the next day.

We had to wait till after check in had closed for someone to drive to the airport with a different list, during this time we were told nothing we had no idea if we would definitely be on that flight. We finally got through and then very quickly had to go through security again and wait to board. We had a two hour wait even though our plane had arrived - we got given no information. I hadn't had a drink in over 4 hours due to the fact you can't take liquids into the airport and then the only place I could buy a drink I was only there for a minute until I had to move again into somewhere we couldn't take liquids. They had moved some people up to business class and then after about an hour took in everyones tickets and got them reprinted, back to economy. Finally once we were on and then arrived at Istanbul, due to the fact we were 2 hours late one of my friends travelling with us had missed her next flight. Throughout the whole journey she was asking for help, she was literally on the back seat of the plane and wouldn't allow her to be one of the first to get off so she was the last person off. We then had to wait for a bus to take us to the airport. Once there we tried to find someone to help her, she asked someone who sent her to somewhere you go if you didn't have a boarding pass - this wasn't the issue (causing her to be even later).

2016-09-24,"""very good business class product""",8,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Montreal via Istanbul. Check in at JNB was uneventful. Turkish Airlines uses the SAA lounge which is pretty ordinary but food choices are extensive. Boarding was delayed due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft but was conducted in an orderly manner. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept and the FA's were friendly and spoke very good English. Food and wine quality were good but I would have liked to have a few South African wines. Dinner and drink service was very slow and it took us over three hours to get to desert once we were airborne. The aircraft on the JNB-IST leg did not have wifi and although the IFE had a large selection of movies, it was on the skinny side when it came to new releases. Flight landed on time and with almost every flight we were bussed to the terminal. Spent a few hours in the Istanbul lounge which is well and truly an amazing experience with a very large array of food and beverage offerings. Boarding on the second leg was absolutely chaotic and TK should be ashamed of putting their premium passengers through that ordeal. Once again we were bussed to the aircraft. The second A330 was brand new and the crew and their service were outstanding. I felt pampered throughout the 10 hour flight and was able to catch 3 hours of very comfortable rest in the lie flat seats. The WiFi on the second leg did not work despite the pursers countless efforts to get it up and running. The food on the second leg was superior to the first which likely was related to catering being done out of TK's hub in Istanbul. The flight landed on time but the luggage delivery was slow with priority bags coming out towards the end. Turkish offers a very good business class product on long-haul routes and I would not hesitate to use them again.

2016-10-03,"""woke 20 minutes before take off""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Dar es Salaam to London via Istanbul. I was on an overnight flight from Dar es Salaam departing at 03.25 to arrive at Attaturk Airport at 10.25 later that morning. The plane was an old model and the seats did not recline completely. Sleep was not easy. One of the stewardess's in the business section could barely speak English, was unable to make herself understood and spent a lot of time opening & shutting overhead compartments in the business section, making it difficult for me to sleep (I was in seat 2B). My problem arose at Attaturk Airport when, only having a 2 hour layover, I chose to go to the business class lounge to relax until the connecting flight to London. However, I fell asleep and woke 20 minutes before take off. What I hadn't realised was that the gate was a 25 minute walk from the lounge and though I ran I made it to the gate only to be told the gate had closed, that I would need to go to the information desk to get another ticket for an alternative flight to London. When asked for instructions to the information desk, I was given incorrect information as to how to get there. Every member of the ground staff I asked told me a different direction, and were most unhelpful. Eventually I was told I needed to go to the transfer department - again given incorrect directions. Finally when I spoke to a member of staff there, he told me I had to go to the ticket office as he could not issue a ticket for me. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the ticket office. Back to information, who told me I had to go through passport control. When I got there I was told I needed a visa. Why? After all I'm airside, I'm not leaving the airport - no one had the courtesy to tell me that the only place I could buy a new ticket was outside the transit area. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the visa desk. I purchased a visa that cost me £20, went through passport control and eventually managed to find the ticket office. Again, I was met by very surly ticket office sales staff who were most unhelpful and who tore up my boarding pass & suggested I would have to pay a further £1050 for a business class ticket or £435 for a single economy ticket. She suggested if I wanted to try to buy one cheaper, I could do so online. When asked what the Wi-Fi code was, I was told there wasn't any. Having no alternative but to buy the economy ticket, I was then told to go to the incorrect check in desk! Standing in line for ages, when I got to the desk, I was told I had to go to 'C' section. Finally I came across the one and only helpful staff member, who understood my predicament, was sympathetic and helped me through the process of locating my luggage (which had obviously been off loaded from the original aircraft I was supposed to be on) and assured me it would be on the flight I was now booked on. I was aware that I had a restricted ticket and would therefore forfeit the ticket for a no show, or cancellation etc, however, what I did not expect was the rudeness and unhelpfulness from Turkish Airlines ground staff.

Check in was quick and easy as was the priority fast track and boarding. On board the first flight the crew were friendly, helpful and attentive. The seats wide and comfortable and the food and wines excellent. The lounge in Istanbul was large but with plenty of seating and a wide choice of freshly cooked food and snacks. Not that we ate having had a delicious lunch. We boarded the plane to Mauritius and were immediately impressed by the welcome, the cleanliness and the comfort of the cabin. Straight after take off the Chef (yes they have an on board chef) came round with the dinner menu. Pre dinner drinks were served with small bowls of nuts and olives to be followed by a variety of hot and cold canapés served from the trolley. Our tray tables were beautifully set and dinner was served with all the little extra chefs touches just like in a first class restaurant. After an truly wonderful meal the cabin crew asked could they make up our beds. A bed pack was produced with mattress pillows and duvet. Our seats then became fully flat beds and I had a restful night. Having already chosen our breakfast we were wakened to yet another lovely meal. Arrival was on time and our baggage arrived quickly We had the same experience on our return flights nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff. Having travelled to Mauritius many times in British Airways business class and experienced the scruffy aircraft and the lack of service, travelling with Turkish Airlines was a breath of fresh air much more @like being-in first class. I cannot recommend Turkish Airlines highly enough and look forward to travelling with them again. Turkish Airlines deserves 5*.

On the positive side, food is excellent, service is attentive and overnight on long distance is a good as it can get on a plane. Transit in Istanbul has been reported as problem by numerous passengers. This is due to outsourcing to TAS Turkish Airport Services which is not part of TK. TK has made efforts to make transit as pleasant as possible in IST, such as allowing transit passengers to access the departure level without going through security control again and providing the most fabluous lounge in the world. If you have a jetty for departure, boarding is a very orderly process. Problems arise when there is no jetty and passengers just scramble into a shuttle.

Especially on the A330-200. The planes are old, dirty and the seats often broken. To top it off, the inflight enterntainment did not work on a 13 hour flight. An airline should be consistent and offer the same hard product in C-class across their entire fleet.

Outbound flight is an overnight flight and the meal is served early in the flight allowing passengers to sleep for the rest of the journey. Experience was OK apart from the comfort of the seat. Legroom was great as I was in an exit seat, but the seat is very hard which is very uncomfortable for a 5 hour journey. The return flight some days later was on an identical (maybe the same) aircraft. A hot breakfast (that was actually very cold) was served at the beginning of the 6 hour return flight followed by some drinks a few hours later. For such a long journey I would expect a light refreshment to be served towards the latter part of the flight and a hotter meal. On both flights most of the crew were very indifferent and non-caring towards passengers with the exception of some who appeared to be from Kazakhstan who seemed to be smiling and helpful. On descent into Ataturk Airport water started to stream out of the ceiling (perhaps from melting ice) of the plane onto me and the passenger in front of me. We were both seated in exit row seats by the window. It was not possible to get out of my seat at this time as we were so close to landing so I had to use pillows and blankets to cover myself from the water. Due to a bird strike incident with the plane in front of us we had to ascend sharply to make another landing approach. We flew for a further ten minutes before landing safely. Pilot communication during this incident was very acceptable which was pleasing. I advised the flight attendant on exiting about the water leak and my clothing she told me that this sometimes happens - very poor attitude towards customer.

We had previously tried to rebook our flights via the TK homepage as we had originally planned to fly back to MUC on Friday 11th. Unfortunately, TK´s homepage in Turkey is different (""old version"") from the one available in Germany (""new version""). If you try to rebook a flight or do your online check-in on the old version the programme will send you into nirvana. Thus we wasted half a day going to their city office at Taksim Square to rebook the flight with the help of an unfriendly and unpologetic office clerk who charged a hefty rebooking fee. For the online check-in we tried the Taksim Square office again which turned out to be closed but we were fortunate enough to find out there is another office nearby at Harbiye where the nice and helpful TK staff was able to assign our seats but not to print out our boarding passes - TK, an airline full of mystery. On Sunday, security/passport checks at Ataturk airport surprisingly efficient despite general overcrowding and TK ground staff in the check-in area friendly and helpful. We went to gate 206 and found there are no info screens stating destination or scheduled boarding time. Boarding started 30 minutes after scheduled time; no explanation, no apology. Previously, TK staff came around checking some passports and boarding passes for no apparent reason as they had been checked before, then he got distracted by something and never returned. As boarding got underway, TK did something that sums up the whole way that they do things: there were 3 boarding channels for economy class passengers appropriately named A, B and C, plus a separate channel for business class passengers. TK staff opens business class channel first and then minds her own business, with the effect that all passengers, business class or not, stampede through the business class channel until they realise the plane is half full and blocks off business class channel, arguing with passengers who don´t understand what is going on while the rest of us are waiting patiently at A, B or C. Ambience on the plane just as bad as on our inbound flight to Istanbul, except the staff were friendlier and more efficient, and the food was better. Cabin announcements just as erratic, English version totally unintelligible. We took off almost an hour late because of rush hour at Ataturk and were merely informed by the captain that we would land 30 minutes late in Munich, no apology. Back in Munich, the usual sluggish MUC immigration and customs, 2 officers for a planeload of 200 people (not TK´s fault for a change). TK´s performance on this flight was better than on the inbound flight, but I would still recommend using another airline if you can.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,915,Family Leisure,IST to MUC,November 2016,A321,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I travel a lot of airlines between Boston and Bombay, and the tickets with Turkish Airlines were significantly cheaper. For the most part Turkish Airlines is average. The Istanbul airport layout leaves a lot to be desired but is made up by the food (Pistachio Icecream and Lamb). My complaint is with their Customer service which is abysmal. I needed to delay my departure because my Father-in-law was very ill. They had no Customer Service in India. I called their HQ and even though I selected the English option, they continued to talk in Turkish. I then called the US office (might as well). They gave a price 3 times my original fare just to change the dates ($2000 per ticket - my original fare was $850). To top it all, they will not accept credit cards. I would have to mail them a ""check"" and when they got it they would change it if there was availability!

Kiev to Istanbul was a short flight and everything went very well arrived on time. From Istanbul to Manila flight is after midnight and I spent some time in the lounge. This is by far the best lounge but this is only applicable in terms of hardware and in terms of F&B products. Soft skills, understanding of Service and how tired a passenger can be is not the concern of employees. Star Alliance passengers also patronize this lounge which makes it super crowded. Boarding is another mess ground staff creates group to ease the boarding, however it doesnt help at all. Many economy class passengers use Business class lane and this is acceptable by staff.  Flight was perfect, in the past the crew was not attentive though they gradually improved their standards and current status is extremely good.

When questioned the response was an astonishing ""I guess I forgot"". For a carrier that prides itself in its inflight catering and boasts about being Europe's best this was a shocking and totally unacceptable response.

Got a complimentary 5* hotel for my layover, yet had to wait for almost an hour before it was arranged (without any crowd at the desk). Another negative point for ground service - staff at Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul was unable to handle any reservation change, been told to go to transfer desk (which is in the arrivals area and would thus need to re-clear security to get back to departures). Istanbul to Buenos Aires a slightly worn Boeing 777, yet full recline seat. Great attentive staff, printed menu, food was great and plentiful - two full services, one light (sandwiches) plus an ample choice of self-service items. Despite a dedicated wine list being presented, had to explicitely request wine, crew never offered it. Free wifi for business passengers is a great plus as well, although the connection was faltering at some moments.

2016-12-08,"""had a horrible experience """,1,"✅ Verified Review |  In September 2016 I had a horrible experience with Turkish Airlines. My flight (TK-476) was on 17/09 from Ekaterinburg (Russia) to Barcelona via Istanbul. The time of departure was supposed to be at 7.30 - arriving time to Istanbul at 10.15 and the departure to BCN at 14.40 - so having 4.25 hours would be more than enough to change the plane in Istanbul. Unfortunately the Turkish Airlines delayed the flight in Russia for more than 3 hours. I can understand that there might be some technical problems or something but in that case the company is supposed to ""think"" of its passengers and be more client-oriented which I haven't noticed. The representatives didn't give any explanations regarding the reasons of delay, time of the flight, food, etc. When we finally arrived to Istanbul we still had enough time to catch the plane to BCN (we had 1 hour before the flight) and  they could delay the plane for 15-20 min to let us in (I was not the only passenger - we were like 20 people who found themselves in this situation).  The only thing they said was ""sorry, you have to wait for the next plane"" (additional 5 hours of waiting). They ignored us and our questions. After that I asked for food and I was given some sort of a coupon which was possible to use only in some places in food court. The cheapest ones, as I realized later. So the only thing I managed to have using this coupon was a bottle of water. Therefore sitting in Istanbul airport waiting for the plane for 5 hours I had to spend my money on normal food in a normal place. For the information: before that in Russia I was waiting for 3 hours and nobody informed me about breakfast so again I had to spend my money on food there. My advice to Turkish Airlines:  teach your employees how to communicate with clients and to be more client-oriented.

While the ground staff at the Domestic IST CIP terminal are great in reserving front rows or exit seats for their premium Miles&Smiles members, unfortunately, the TGS ground staff in BJV are the opposite. When I asked politely if I could have a window seat towards the front of the cabin I was handed a boarding card with a seat in the last row with a grin. I then asked if I could do a last minute mileage upgrade. Was first told that it was no problem, then the counter agent contacted her supervisor/colleague which first said that there was availability and that she could process my request but then strangely asked for my name, I could hear the whole conversation over the radio. I guess unless you are a local VIP your commercial value is of little importance. Then suddenly a barrage of invalid excuses followed. First she suggested that my fare class did not allow a last minute upgrade, when I pointed out that was untrue, it was unavailabllity bucket class C, which is also untrue according to M&S rules, finally she said there was a problem with their system, a TGS classic, I was handed out a seat in 6A and did not pursue the matter any further as a line began to form behind me. Not that of a big problem for a 50 minute flight but having had worse problems before, I was reminded once more how TK's ground services and customer service attitude on the ground, bar TK Do&Co, is a total mess.

However, had a truly awful experience with their customer service during the return flight, Istanbul was hit by blizzards the afternoon of the evening return flight which caused chaos with cancellations of all flights from all Istanbul airports, unfortunate, not much one can do about the weather. What is deplorable is the experience I have had with their customer service. Given the situation as one can imagine the ticket sales/changes queue at the airport was astronomical with everyone trying to rearrange travel arrangements. Spoke with a THY staff member who said I could rearrange over the phone. Waiting for half an over on the phone reached a customer service representative who informed me that as the KL to Perth flight was with a partner airline and THY they could not complete the booking and I had to go in person to the THY ticket office. So I went to the other airport in Istanbul at 3am in a taxi in a blizzard. Upon arriving at the ticket sales office they said they emailed the partner airline but that we would have to wait for a confirmation response. No indication of time frames. We waited for an hour then a different staff member told us that there was no need for us to wait at the airport and that in fact there was no need for us to have come in person to the airport to do this and the call staff had misinformed us. After getting a few hours sleep I then spent half the day repeatedly calling Turkish Airlines chasing any updates. Eventually I was told that in fact we were on standby with the other airline which was strange as the other airlines website was showing tickets for sale. After tearing my hair out eventually I spoke directly with the original booking travel agent who changed the booking no problem wish I had done that sooner rather than wasting my time with THY. Unfortunately the same issue has happened again with the rebooked flight tonight being cancelled due to weather and I am now going through the entire process again. No one can or will give me a telephone number for the ticket sales office instead I am told that I have to get a taxi, drive an hour each way if I'm lucky in the snow and repeat the crazy process of telling the ticket sales office in person exactly what I've told the call centre for them to lodge the booking request with the other airline and then wait until who knows when for them to get back. I have repeatedly asked to speak to a more senior management staff at the call centre to resolve the issue to be told there is no one more senior. Considering the trip was bought as one continuous flight how on earth THY cannot resolve this from their end with the partner airline beggars belief and why on earth one has to physically go to the ticket office to do this seems illogical and hugely inconvenient.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,939,Couple Leisure,IST to KUL,December 2016,,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

We boarded the flight in complete chaos, they tried to change our seats that we booked months ago, the entertainment system crashed, and when we arrived the luggage took forever and was wet.

There was no food or water provided from Turkish Airlines. In the end, I had to book the accommodation by myself as there was another 4 hrs queue at their hotel information desk.

Turkish Airlines customer service extremely chaotic and disorganized, the worst flight experience I have ever had. I realize that the bad weather conditions (snow) was out of the airlines control on the night of 6th January in Istanbul, the service and the little information provided by TK was extremely poor and confusing. Soon after we landed in IST, we were informed that all flights were cancelled due to bad weather conditions. There was no clear information or guidance provided and the few (rude) TK staff members present at Ataturk airport seemed not interested / willing to assist passengers about what to do. All we got was wrong information and their ground staff kept sending us from one desk to another. That first night, after 4 hrs spent in the airport to get some information, I decided to go to an hotel paid by myself. The following morning (07 January) we were informed that all flights were cancelled again due to snow and I had to queue almost 7 hrs at the ticketing office to rebook my flight for the next day. In the end, I had to book the accommodation by myself again, as there was another extremely long queue at their hotel information desk. On 08 January, my flight to KRT cancelled again and again 7 hours of queue to rebook the flight. The third day I went to the airport in the morning, this time the flight was confirmed so I checked in and entered the departure area after passport control but the flight to KRT was cancelled once again at about 04.00 PM and again a chaotic queue at the immigration and after another queue at the ticket office to re-change my flight, with no help or guidance from TK staff. After that and after 3 more hours of queue to get an hotel, I managed to have a room only at 04 AM, since we spent time driving around Istanbul looking for a free hotel, since they were all full booked with TK passengers stranded in the city.

The departure was on time,  aircraft was new (with sky interior lightning) and very clean. There weren't too many passengers. Therefore, there was a free middle seat between me and the other passenger. The seat pitch was fine. In the beginning, I got a chocolate praline. Then we got earbuds (bad quality and shallow sound but it is economy so I am not going to complain) and I managed to watch a full movie during the flight (the screen was pretty large and had good resolution). The food on this short-haul flight was tasty and it included a hot meal (which is rare on European flights) and a complimentary beverage (I recommend Ayran yoghurt and homemade lemonade but you can also take alcoholic drinks).

2017-01-17,"""nice when everything goes right""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Turkish Airlines is nice when everything goes right. However, if something goes wrong they are really terrible. Case in point, I recently flew from Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. Both flights were delayed by an hour. The onboard service was very good on both legs. Onboard the service is of a higher quality than that of US airlines. However, when we arrived into Dubai, all 3 of our bags were missing. Since both flights were delayed over an hour, there was plenty of time to transfer the bags. However, our bags didn't make it and apparently, neither did the bags of some other passengers who originated from Houston. Believe it or not, after a long flight from Houston to Istanbul, upon arrival you do not arrive at a jetway. You arrive at remote parking and have to take a bus to the terminal. This also has an impact on baggage and for this reason alone, I would not recommend Turkish. The resolution of the baggage has been awful. The only way to communicate with TK is via twitter. 2 of our bags have been found but one seems to be completely gone. In this age of barcode bagtags, I just do not see how this happens. I can't recommend anyone take Turkish Airlines based on my experience. They are horrible when anything goes awry.

I was very relaxed before the flight. However, the ground service is not well-organized nor polite. It took me 2 hours to get to know of the free hotel option. Anyway, the boarding was fine, I liked the hot refreshing towel, the cosmetic kit with slippers and socks, the blanket and pillow. The tablet had good resolution so I enjoyed a movie. The catering was great (as always), so were the beverages. We arrived with a 1 hour delay. Apart from long queues at the passport control, which is not the fault of Turkish Airlines, I had to wait another hour for my luggage, which is the airline's handling agency fault. There were suitcases from 3 wide-body jets on just one belt at the same time. The overall experience was very good.

I could only say that this North America flight has gone downhill in last few years. The plane seemed aged, seats were not comfy, narrow for 10 hours flight. It could be my luck getting an older plane, and it could be different with newer planes for the same route.  Check-in to the flight was a complete mess. Instead of calling with zones or Tier everyone invited to open counters, and it caused huge line ups and mess in the plane. Cabin staff was nice, courteous but not helpful. They lied about foods to people especially who were not a native speaker of Turkish.  They passed, drinks and food items over passengers heads to their colleague if they were out on their carts. I felt extremely warm in my seat. Complained about it and the answer was this is the coldest they can get at this altitude for maximum air quality in the cabin. The final part is that 2 of my luggage get lost on this flight, Turkish Airlines cannot locate my luggage, and each representative over the phone tells different location.

2017-01-23,"""recommend Turkish Airlines""",9,"✅ Verified Review |  Bogota to Rome via Istanbul. We booked the tickets back in early October 2016 for the 5 of us, as part of our once-a-year-trip to Germany. The offers with LH for the direct flight BOG-FRA were not interesting at all. Being a Star Gold Card holder I preferred to travel with a Star Alliance partner, and knowing that TK started to serve BOG in May 2016, I looked for this option, but prices to any German destination were still rather high, so for pure curiosity I went searching the prices for other European destinations. Rome with a very attractive price was the hit, so we decided to fly TK via IST to Italy, staying one night in IST and one night in Rome, before heading on to FRA with a very cheap Alitalia ticket. Bogota to Istanbul has a stop-over in Panama City, and the same flight number back to BOG from IST. So when boarding the plane in BOG we found many passengers originating in Istanbul with Panama as their destination. So the plane was packed on the short flight to Panama, with many passenger leaving the plane in PTY, but not too many passengers boarding to fly to Istanbul. This meant that my wife and myself had a row of 2 seats for ourselves on the way over during this long 13h flight. The service offered by crew was faultless, the food was very good and nicely presented, I would say the best I had in Economy so far. The crew was attentive and willing to help in any case. During the long flight my wife flew into her birthday, and I asked if they can do anything for her. They smiled and promised to arrange a surprise. 20 minutes later they came along with the on-board chef, presenting a cake, nicely prepared with candles and cream saying happy birthday, champagne from Business Class for both of us, and singing happy birthday to her! The plane arrived on time in IST, and we went on the City tour Turkish Airlines offers to their international transfer passengers. This tour is free and takes you to the most important tourist sites in Istanbul, and includes a nice lunch. After the tour ended, the guide stayed in the city with those who were not in a hurry, like us, and took us around some more places.  Next morning flight to Rome, with a nicely presented and filling breakfast, better than most Intra-European business class meals on other airlines. Trip back to Colombia in January the same quality on all flights, I was a bit concerned about our luggage due to some comments here about lost baggage, but all arrived safely in BOG. During the 6h layover at Atatürk airport we used the Turkish Airlines lounge. A huge place, nicely decorated, with great F&B options, nice showers and some other gimmicks like electronic driving range, pool table, etc - a very good place to easily spend the time and get a nice rest before the very long flight back to BOG. That flight was totally packed, nevertheless the crew again offered a great service. I cannot complain about lack of friendliness and professionalism. Saying that, however, we were lucky enough to travel back to BOG a week after the snow chaos at Atatürk airport. Things probably would have been different for us if we had travelled some days earlier.

2017-03-06,"""OK for point-to-point connections""",4,"✅ Verified Review |  I had to get from Amsterdam to Antalya, and in winter time Turkish Airlines seemed to be the only decent option with a daily service. The flight was via SAW, the other airport in Istanbul. AMS-SAW was uneventful and not memorable, except the aircraft was an old A320 with a worn and not very clean cabin. No entertainment system, food offer was decent, but rather below average for an almost 4hr flight, flight attendants busy about themselves. Everything has indicated that the flights from and to SAW is a very low priority for Turkish Airlines. The scheduled transfer time in SAW was 1 hour, however the crowd at the passport control was far too huge to manage this within the time indicated in the reservation. I approached employees of Turkish Airlines and informed them about possible problems with my connection to AYT, and they could not help but tell me that yes, indeed there is no way to pass through the passport control except waiting in the line, then another employee put me on a fast track line, and then another one kicked me out of there explaining that I was not entitled to it. Most of the Turkish Airlines transfer staff also could not speak any English, and those who could had a lot of problems with this. At the end, it took me over 1 hr 30 min to pass through passport control, and I was rebooked to the next flight departing from SAW at 00.10 am instead of initially planned 8.05 pm. On the transfer desk they also gave me a voucher for a meal in McDonalds, the voucher could be redeemed only for the cheapest burger menu worth c.a. EUR 4.5. Needless to say, that is below anything that can be expected from a major air carrier, and I went to another place to get my meal on my own. No free internet in SAW, and the procedure for getting the paid one is crazily complicated. The flight from SAW to AYT was uneventful too, a brand-new B737-800 with a great entertainment system and a good sandwich; all that looked a bit unnecessary on this 50 min flight. On my way backed I changed in IST, the main airport in Istanbul. Both flights were quite the same as on my way from AMS, except that the aircraft of the IST-AMS was a B737-800 with a good entertainment system, in contrast to the entertainment system, the cabin looked quite worn, with the cracks on plastic details. The food offer is the same “a bit below average” menu as on the AMS-SAW flight. Summing up, the Turkish can be OK for point-to-point connections, but I would avoid transfer flights with them. SAW cannot handle transfers in a decent manner, due to apparent infrastructural, organisational and human capacity constraints. IST is slightly better, but it is very crowded, not very clean, poorly organised and has very confusing navigation, I had no contacts with transfer staff there, but got a few hints that the expectation should be high. There is no free internet in both airports, and the paid access is quite challenging to configure and get through. The voucher for the cheapest McDonalds meal in SAW was the final touch in the ungraceful picture of transfers in IST and SAW.

Check-in and boarding in Singapore went swiftly, on board the A333 to Istanbul the food, drinks service and entertainment was excellent (you'll receive a menu for the service). Also received the best amenities kit of any airline I've flown - not even Qatar gives out slippers and lip balm in theirs! No amenities kit on the Istanbul-Lisbon sector but it was more of the same: good entertainment, good food and drinks on board a clean B738. Cabin crew were very friendly on both sectors. Return sector was even better - the flight left the gate at Lisbon Airport on time. Good service once again with the regular drinks service, delicious meal of roasted meat and a very friendly bunch of flight attendants The entertainment system on board the A320 winglets was better than my outgoing flights, with a better touchscreen interface. Departure from Istanbul-Singapore also on-time, with a new A333 that had the newest entertainment system on board (it has live news from BBC and CNN). Good meal service once again with a relish pasta rigatoni, although I wish they didn't run out of meal choices on board. A slightly different brand of amenities kit was given out on this flight, but the contents were the same. On-time arrival in Singapore.

I want to address the way they handle the laptop ban imposed by USA and UK. The devices that are not checked in the luggage, are accepted by the airline representatives at the boarding gate, after all the passport and security checks. The devices are wrapped in bubble packs and a special receipt is given to the passenger. The wrapped devices are placed in sturdy containers before your very eyes. At the other end, Turkish Airlines have a stand right after you clear the passport control but before clearing the customs. They check your receipt and give you back your laptop. No muss no fuss.

No gate posted for the departure until 55 min before, so uneasy walking around not knowing which wing to proceed to. Long tarmac delay with no explanation from TK. In general their English annoucements are difficult to understand. A320 with a friendly crew, nice hot lunch and a nice bar service.

In both cases, the first flight was late, giving us barely 30 mins to catch the next flight whose gate was really far away. The connecting flight was also Turkish Airlines, but still there was no support at the airport even though their first flight was late. While coming back from Mumbai, at Istanbul, there was an additional security check and the queue was long and our flight was in 15 mins! Nobody gave us any support there either and by some luck, one of the fellow passengers in the same situation was told by people waiting with us that we can go to priority security check if the flight is leaving soon. There was no sign for this or any indication from either Turkish Airlines or airport staff. We barely made it to the next flight 2 mins before gate closed even though the aircraft didn't take off for next 30 mins or more.

The seats and interiors are really old, and very narrow on the A320 models (a kid won't even fit). Service is not really outstanding like you read in reviews, just basic and a bit cheap. Cabin staff can be quite stiff and really not friendly, which does not give the best sense of welcome claimed in their marketing. However the ground staff in Istanbul is quite outstanding and efficient! Our flight was 40min late with only 1 hour connection, but someone waits at the exit gate and takes groups of pax with short connections directly to the next gate; within 5min you are in the next flight which is unusual for connecting trips. My travel partner had also forget his tablet in the first leg aircraft from TBS, and immediately the gate staff had it collected and brought directly to the boarding of the next leg while we were boarding.

The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I've witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the ""angled flat"" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you'll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won't come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I'm more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I'd fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation.

I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective.

TK uses a dedicated business class check in with extra passport formalities for flights bound for Canada, USA, UK and Israel. This process was slow and added time to the check in process. Flight boarded slightly late but in an orderly fashion. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with ample storage space for small articles. The overhead bin space however was limited due to the bedding they keep on hand. Drinks and lunch were offered after take off and having traveled the same route 6 weeks prior I was surprised to see the same menu. Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown. This limits the amount of sleep you can expect to get. The wifi worked only part of the flight. It was an all around good flight with a great cabin crew. The French announcements from the cockpit were a nice touch.

In both Amsterdam and Amman as well in transit in Istanbul we could use priority facilities allowing us to skip the lines for security. Turkish Airlines uses the Aspire Lounge in the Non-Schengen area of Schiphol Airport which was crowded and poorly stocked with food and drink options. In Amman they use the Royal Jordanian lounge which is spacious and well stocked with  food and drink. During the 2 layover in Istanbul we used the Turkish Airline lounge which is huge with a lot of amenities and food options and again a good WIFI network. We even found some time to toy around with the Golf simulator on the lower floor of the lounge. The flights were the typical medium haul service, all 4 flights left reasonably in time and arrived spot on time at destination. On the day flights between Amsterdam and Istanbul a lunch respectively breakfast were offered. All the food was tasty and nicely presented. During the night flights between Istanbul and Amman, prior to take-off we were offered diner respectively breakfast but in both cases we opted to sleep which was perfectly possible in the sleeper seats in he A340 and A330.

The flight itself was fine - not notably good or bad compared to many other airlines I have been on. My bag was delayed on the connection which was annoying but acceptable for a day, but less ideal when it became a second day with no explanation or contact from Turkish Airlines. But, their response to the issue was the worst and most customer unfriendly service I have ever had from any provider or any service, and has remained so for weeks. No ability to raise the issue by email, and online service down. No-one seeming to read anything submitted, in favour of moving it to another department as fast as possible and not just once, but time and time again. Asking for image of my passport (that they didn't need), over an online submission form that is insecure, in breach of their own privacy policy and all passably acceptable practice;  ignoring the claim made and it would appear all text entered on their system; saying a bag whose main zip was broken to the point of not being able to shut anymore 'does not constitute any impediment for use of the baggage'; and not seeming to have a central complaint team. They could have got praise for sorting an issue out well; instead all their publicity about customer service appears to be hot air.

Their meals are tasty and generous. They distribute printed menus and amenity kits. Their check in staff are friendly and efficient. My originating United Airlines flight from Tampa was cancelled at the last minute, and after much scrambling, I arrived at the Turkish counter at JFK only 50 minutes before scheduled departure to IST. The flight had just closed, but the Turkish staff took pity on me and checked me in anyway. Both flights (New York JFK to Istanbul and Istanbul to Madrid) departed and arrived punctually. Despite the fact that the on-line seat map showed that the Kennedy - Ataturk flight was essentially empty up until the day before, when we boarded there were only a handful of empty seats. Where did those 150 mystery passengers come from? The economy class seat pitch is quite tight, I would have paid extra for an exit row seat, but it had appeared that I was going to have the whole back of the plane to myself. On the IST-MAD flight, we had an empty middle seat, and this contributed to a much more comfortable experience.

2017-06-15,"""the flight had been cancelled""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Montreal to Istanbul on TK36. Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out check-in had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day, there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a one-day delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do. If TK is well and truly aspiring to become one of the leading carriers, they need to significantly pick up their game in customer relations and response to unforeseen events.",Business Class,,,,,1,no,1012,Business,Montreal to Istanbul,June 2017,A330,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep.

In most aspects, the flight was outstanding. Lamentably, the only negative occurred right at the start. Check-in went quickly, and the Gold Track security line was instantaneous. I did not have much time to experience the TK lounge because the TV monitors called passengers to the gate and hour and a half before departure. Gate 208 at IST was an absolute caldron. Of course, the security checks for USA departures are extensive, and as I had been informed, my ipad needed to be gate-checked. The problem was waiting and waiting in a huge crowd in a painfully hot gate area. By the time we boarded, I was drenched in perspiration. This is a problem that must be addressed, because a flight that begins uncomfortably in the extreme has to struggle to get back into pleasant territory. Nevertheless, once we boarded, the experience was exceptional. Seating on the 777-300 is 2x3x2. Every seat was occupied, but the seats themselves were full recline and provided adequate room. It almost goes without saying that the DO & CO food onboard was plentiful and delicious. TK provides a dining experience comparable to that of a fine restaurant. Cabin service was outstanding, and passengers who wanted to work or surf were provided with a laptop. The various quirks of the laptop took some time to decipher, but in the end, this provided several hours of amusement. There was a huge selection of movies, music, games, and TV shows.

Decided to go with Turkish Airlines as they had a compelling offer for the holidays. Check-in at LHR was quick and efficient, priority security check provided and access to any of the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal 2 (LH, United, Singapore or Canadian or the Premium Plaza lounge which TK contracts). Boarding began a little late and started somewhat disorganised with conflicting announcements but once the gate agents got them selves sorted boarding was quick and efficient. Lunch was served on the short flight to IST, single tray with 3 options for main course. Not great but beats most airlines. Seat was fully flat and IFE was excellent although no WiFI on this flight. The cabin attendants were a bit robotic but very nice. Flight was on time in to IST and when straight to a gate. On disembarkation there was a choice for connecting flights or arrivals but it looked like they had cordoned off the connecting flight route. Turned out they wanted to see boarding passes to let you through, slightly confusing and not very intuitive. Next flight was also on time, this time there was WiFi on top of the excellent IFE and although the WiFi was slow it worked well through the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic with the attendants looking after our section coming around at the beginning of the flight to introduce herself and point out the cabin service director as well. Seats were comfortable and everything worked with the cabin clean and tidy upon boarding. Amenity kits were handed out shortly after boarding. The evening meal was served about 45 minutes after take off. The starter and desert were great but the mains were pathetic, labelled as “salad and steak” it took some searching of the salad to find the miniature piece of beef. Meals have clearly declined with TK. We were given cards to order breakfast but they were never collected and the breakfast handout was a bit random and the hot options were a bit strange but tasted ok none the less.

There really isn't much of a welcome when you first arrive on board. It takes a while for you to be offered a drink and for a business class traveller, I didn't get any service really throughout the whole flight. There was on both legs of the flight a few moody staff members.  The seat itself is really good. Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board.  Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price. I can let the attention they don't provide to the customers go, but it does need to be addressed. There also doesn't seem to be anything available to snack on in-between meals.

I made sure that I purchased the ticket with the correct code (B) since you can only upgrade on Y and B codes. Then I upgraded the ticket using my miles, but was then told that the upgrade would change the code to an I. Code I does means that I get no miles for the flight even though I paid full price for the ticket. I tried to contact Turkish Airlines through their website and received no reply. I tried to contact them through their social media sites and was told to be patient and I would receive a reply. Two weeks later I checked the status and found out that Turkish Airlines had canceled my ticket. I contacted my travel agent who found out that my upgrade had created a duplicate ticket in their system so they had just canceled everything, all without informing me.

Flight was delayed due to weather in BKK, unfortunately they only announced the delay after everyone had gone to the gate. Flight boarded about 45 min late and the crew were not quite ready when passengers boarded as they had arrived late and seemed a bit stressed about the delay which stuck with them for most of the flight. Despite the stress they were friendly and provided a good service. Welcome drinks were served but they ran out of TK's signature lemonade, which is a bit poor. That said the flight was otherwise great, dinner was served swiftly after take off and the food was a huge improvement on the outbound flight. The steak was one of the best I have had on a flight for years. After dinner beds were made and the lights were turned off. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and this time the crew did remember to collect the breakfast orders so everything was served correctly. Despite the delay in take off we landed on time in IST. Transfer security were not quite awake when we showed up at 4 am in IST but we got through quickly and on to the excellent lounge at IST. While the lounge is excellent, by 6am is was extremely busy and seat were hard to come by. As personal electronic devices has to be gate checked for travel to the UK the gate process took about 15 minutes to get through but TK has done a fairly good job of streamlining the process, especially for business class passengers. Boarding was reasonably organised and boarding for the LHR flight was quickly completed. Flight this time was a Boeing 777 which left on time from IST. Again breakfast was quickly served. While the hot choice was limited is was tasty none the less. The cabin crew was far more relaxed on this flight and an absolute pleasure. Flight landed on time at LHR.

No recognition of business class passengers - we pay for this experience, but it is non existent. Narrowbody business class seating not overly comfortable, especially when in the recline position, especially the leg rest or lack of leg rest. Poor in flight service, feeling of being a burden to the cabin staff, despite only 50% occupation on business class cabin. IFE screen malfunction, poor response from crew and no offer of seat change.  Not worth the extra fare for business class as there was a total lack of experience.

Biggest negative was the very tight leg-room on the long-legs of this trip, especially since the person in front of me put their seat back as soon as we took off for the entire 10 hour trip. Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue. Felt much more comfortable on the 10+ hour Istanbul to Boston leg with my back-pack stored above me rather than under the seat in front of me. Also got a great price by ordering the ticket 4+ months in advance, though did have to pay extra for flight insurance.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1032,Family Leisure,Tel Aviv to Boston via Istanbul,July 2017,,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

The plane was a little late taking off and there seemed to be no hurry with the meal service, a pity as I would rather have slept straight away and just had breakfast.

In there it felt more like a school playground with children running noisily around in circles. Obviously not the fault of Turkish Airlines. Slight delay in boarding as the aircraft came in late. No boarding announcements made (until I boarded at least) but people just moved forward. One lady called out something in barely audible Turkish language, but nothing in English. Before take-off they showed the safety briefing on drop-down screens. Those screens then remained down, just showing the Turkish Airlines logo, throughout the flight. In fact they were still down as we got off the plane in Istanbul. After take-off the Captain explained and apologised for the delay. We were served a warm cheese and tomato roll with soft and hot drinks. In fact identical to the snack when I flew from Istanbul a few days earlier. But it was welcome and tasty and perfectly adequate for 11.30 pm. Two very smiling and friendly flight attendants served us. As we flew in circles the Captain announced a change in runway meant a further 15 minutes delay. We finally landed - with the only occupant in the row in front of me in his seat fully reclined. After landing we were told we could use our electronic devices so I looked at the flight path we had flown. It was certainly convoluted!

2017-08-11,"""last flight very disappointing""",5,"✅ Verified Review |  Istanbul to Bangkok. After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to ""write me up"" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service.

The first time I travelled with Turkish Airlines, the representative even booked a hotel for me, because I was a college student traveling to the US for the first time and I missed my flight with a different airline because of a long customs line in the airport.

However we are satisfied about the staff on board, it's the lack of customer care that makes the final result of this review. As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more.  No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation. I bought a new Samsonite, sent my invoice to them and asked them to solve this matter, but again they answered that only repairs will be paid.  When you pay over 2500 Euros for your tickets, you have the right to expect customer service as it should be. Let's end positive about the airplane and staff.

That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it.

I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted.

By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality.

This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's. One good point was she had a huge, blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future, with a different airline of course.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,1061,Solo Leisure,London to Riyadh via Istanbul,September 2017,,1,1,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Even more impressed with the live television services, though limited channels. I would not have imagined watching a UEFA Champions League / World Cup qualifier game whilst travelling intercontinental. Food is good relative to other airlines. Was relieved that my check-in luggage made it through to Kuala Lumpur, after there was a 50 minutes delay from my departure at Heathrow. At Istanbul, I was off the plane and straightaway dashed to my connection gate. Made it into the connection to Kuala Lumpur, but was resigned that my luggage wouldn't make it and may come in on the following flight. Thankfully, it reached KUL together with me. One reservation about the hardproduct is seat pitch, especially on the A330. I'm 6 foot 1, and really feel the tightness.

The plane has been A321 and I have never seen such a worn out plane. Personal entertainment system was not functioning. The biggest problem was that my seat did not fix in upright position, which was making both me and the passenger behind very uncomfortable. I felt like plane must be 20 years+ old just to find out it is ex Jet Airways (India) plane, only 8.5 years old.

The socks and bottles of salad dressing from the previous flight were left on the seat indicating a poor clean-up and prep effort. The seat was comfortable in both the upright and lie flat position allowing me to get a decent night's sleep. The catering was a let-down and a significant deterioration from what I have experienced on previous TK flights. There were no pre meal canapés, appetizers were limited and main course was bone dry. The wine list featured the same labels as they had 12 months ago. The IFE was OK but could have used more recent releases. The FA's were slow in their service and tended to mill around the galley. Toilets were kept in reasonably good state throughout the flight. The wifi was good and operated without interruption. The flight left late but landed on schedule.

A woman was changing her baby's diaper by the food service area. Flight attendant was incapable of doing something about it. During dinner time they once again run out and I was served this time eggplant with rice.  By the time they service our section my food was cold. I gave my dinner back. When I told the flight attendant she said 'she will let her supervisor know' but nobody came to talk to me nor offered anything else to eat.  I believe I had to get upset like other passengers to receive better dinner and service.

I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldn’t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays. If they adds flights to their schedule between the time of booking and date of travel they will not offer the hotel.

As we got to the boarding gate, we wanted to get the rest of our family onto business class. There were seats available, but the first person we asked said it was impossible to change seats at such a late time. I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class. The reason this is so impressive is that he had to go against the inbuilt systems to delight a customer.

On top we had to pay for 3 visas to stay in Istanbul (total $90). We were told that we will get reimbursed for visas, so upon our return I started requesting reimbursement. We were granted our reimbursement, however to get your money you have to go to their ""closest sales office"" - well guess what, for me it is a 2 hour drive! They refused to mail a check for deposit, so now i am out $90 and had a terrible flight all because of no fault of mine.

You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight.

2017-10-04,"""return trip was badly organized""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Mauritius, with a stopover in Istanbul. That part of the journey went well, without any problems, good service. The return trip was badly organized. On September 30th, flight TK161 (Mauritius-Istanbul) was scheduled for 20.05. First we received the announcement that the flight was delayed until 21:30. At 20:30 we had to go to another gate and then we heard that the flight was canceled. We had to go to another gate, were listed, had to pick up the luggage, went thru the passport check and after 1 hour we were transported by bus to hotels. Our hotel: Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, Mauritius, a 45-minute drive. Room was reasonable but did not seemed to be used recently, because all the lamps were still disconnected and we had no hot water. Dinner consisted of rice, red pepper potatoes, lettuce and a meat sauce.  We have been able to rest for 3 hours because sleep was not possible due to the noise of a disco / nightclub. We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged. Why were we dragged from one place to another, had to watch desperate and exhausted how their employees had heated discussions and everything was so organized badly?

My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat.

There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route.

I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance.

Gone are the days when Business Class food on board Turkish Airlines was exceptional. Now it is ordinary. It is sad to see such short sighted measures being implemented which may have a long lasting impact on the airline's reputation. The flight was on time but the airplane was old. It was clean but the age showed. The most outstanding aspect of the flight was the crew. They were helpful, pleasant, attentive, and friendly.

2017-11-05,"""we missed our flight from Istanbul""",2,"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Tehran via Istanbul. This flight and airport was the worst travel experience we  had. The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached  the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories, we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets, they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul, and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.

2017-11-06,"""no transport from lounge to gate""",6,"✅ Verified Review |  Istanbul to London. My comment is really on the ground experience rather than the flight itself. There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1093,Couple Leisure,Istanbul to London,November 2017,,1,1,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Had a layover of 3.15 hr in Istanbul and went to the lounge. From all reviews the lounge was highlighted as something positive. I would say the lounge needs a refresh. Worn seats, crowded, closed food places, etc.. Not at all what I had in my mind. You could of course drink unlimited liquor. Istanbul to Antananarivo was the best Business travel ever.

2017-11-08,"""trying to book a reservation""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use “old version” or “new version” I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of – why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesn’t have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, there’s no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern.

2017-11-08,"""just doesn't care at all""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Frankfurt to Singapore via Istanbul. FRA-IST then 2.5h layover and IST-SIN. The check-in process was flawless. Turkish Airline personnel on the first leg of the trip was quite grumpy, but professional. Their airplanes are clean, the services offered (entertainment, catering) above average and their crew on the longer, second leg of my trip was fine as well. Unfortunately my new bag didn't arrive in Singapore. It's missing to this very day. The airport luggage handlers in Singapore created a lost baggage report form for me. They called me for four days, every day, to update me that my bag is not yet located. Then they stopped. Turkish Airline's website claims ""Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents."". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it's 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It's as bad a website as I've ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply. Unfortunately it didn't state a thing, was quite possibly a canned message and had vague content like ""On the other hand, if our research brings any negative result, then; the documents, which we have requested from you before, will be forwarded to our Claims department in order for assessment. We would like to thank you for your kind understanding, regarding such period, in advance."". I replied, asked what time frame, what ""period"" we're talking about here, given that the 5 days are over. I got the same canned response. I arrived 13 days ago, I received not 1 comment on my missing bag from Turkish Airlines. They ignored the problem so far. They are opaque about the process, share neither procedures nor timelines/schedules. I'm sitting in Singapore without my things and this airline just doesn't care at all. They claim to be oh-so-customer friendly - and truth is, their service in the air was good. But I sincerely hope that no one ever has to talk to them about lost baggage, because here they are terrible and fail in every customer service metric you can come up with.

Prior to boarding, used the lounge which was operating at a lower pace than usual and the food choices were not as plentiful as they are during regular hours. Boarding was by zones but it was a total disappointment when I found out we were being bussed to the plane which made the use of zones completely redundant. On board, the aircraft looked newish with 2x2x2 configuration in business class. The FA's were pleasant, friendly and professional in the conduct of their duties although they did not intervene when the passenger behind me stood up while the aircraft was taxiing. We were served breakfast then lunch prior to landing but the service was a tad on the slow side. I completed 8 return journeys across the Atlantic with Turkish in the last 12 months and their menu and wine selection have been the same each time and I believe a change is long overdue.

2017-11-23,"""Overall, very good flight""",9,"✅ Trip Verified |  Took advantage of promotional fares on Turkish Airlines’ new route (when I booked) from Istanbul to Phuket. When I arrived in Phuket on the outbound sector, I asked Thai Airways whether on my return I could book a flight with them to Phuket and through check my luggage onto Turkish Airlines, both being Star Alliance. He checked on a list and said I could as Thai have an agreement with Turkish. However, when I got to Bangkok to fly to Phuket and on to Istanbul, Thai said no I couldn’t through check in. Where the agreement failed I have no idea. So had to sit with my luggage for hours waiting for Turkish check-in to open. After check-in, Business Class passengers were personally escorted through Immigration and Security checks and into a lounge. Not the best lounge in the world but quiet and with light snacks available. Offer of shoulder massage was tempting but I just wanted to close my eyes for an hour. At boarding time we were escorted to the gate and given immediate boarding. Before take-off given menus and was asked to complete my breakfast choices. After take-off breakfast was served. I had ordered scrambled eggs but when they reached me in row Four, they said they had all gone. They offered an omelette or waffles; the latter not being on the menu. After breakfast I made up my bed and slept for hours. We had been asked for our lunch selection from the menu. Cabin was crowded - must have been full or close to it. During the night I went to the toilet. The flight deck door was wide open and it looked crowded in there too with some crew standing. In the morning they started the lunch service. In front of me I heard a lady complain and say “But I ordered it.” When they reached me they said they didn’t have the steak I had asked for. I could have the other menu options or a beef stew option which also was not in the menu. I guess the lady had also been disappointed about steak. Landed about 30 minutes early and taken by bus to the terminal - special bus for Business Class passengers. After customs I went to the arrival lounge but it was closed. In fact I have often found it closed recently. Overall, very good flight. On time.

Outbound flight TK1856 from Barcelona to Istanbul left about 40 minutes delayed, and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to Moscow, which resulted in spending an entire night at the airline's lounge. I would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport, who are completely uninterested in helping you out, pretending not to speak English and watching videos on their smartphones, giggling and discussing it with each other. While at the lounge, you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than 8 hours long. So please know, if you miss your flight due to the airline's fault, you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem. That's a fact. The same situation happened to me in April, while returning from Miami to Moscow via Istanbul. The airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child, changing it only for me, therefore, I ended up paying for the completely new tickets. Overpaid around 2000 USD. And, once again, the flight left late from Miami and, therefore, we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport. We were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline. The airline's feedback form is awful, and up to this day my issues with them had not been resolved. Even visiting the airline's office in Moscow does not help, everything is managed through the website. Overall, I am very disappointed with the airline and especially with their customer care.

The representative of the company told me to send him the receipts of the expenses he had had that within a period of 3 weeks they sent me a check for that amount. It's been over 3 months now and they have not sent me anything. They do not even answer the emails that I sent them.

2017-12-10,"""truly a horrible company""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul. My wife encountered a problem in Istanbul that involved an airport transit visa through Canada.  It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: “Reissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didn’t see was the fine print at the bottom: “Turkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.”. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didn’t. I don’t know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered “I can’t accept this”. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day.

Then I was told that I must get a refund at a Turkish Airlines sales office,  there are only 2 in the entire US. I complained and was told to call back. Now I am told that I can get a ""refund"" after cancellation and ""no-show"" fees are applied. This amounted to $32 euros on a $600 ticket.

No wonder it was voted the best business class lounge in the world by Skytrax. We were a bit deceived though, not to be able to have a suite to relax, since our layover was 30 minutes above the 7 hours permitted as per regulations! At least we were able to use the showers after 2.5 hours on a waiting list. Best shower facilities we have ever seen in an airport business class lounge! Onboard, before take-off they offer a selection of newspapers and magazines but nothing in French! Isn’t Turkish Airlines aware that Montreal is the second largest French metropolis in the world, after Paris? Just as an example, Lufthansa flies to Montreal out of Frankfurt and Munich, their safety announcements are in German, French with English subtitles. Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lot’s of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin. Normally with other airlines, they come to your seat and show you the bottle before they pour into your glass. You even have to tell them at some point to stop, because they offer constantly.

Turkish use widebody on most flights to Istanbul, and I was aware that this narrow body aircraft which I was flying in was not going to be as spacious. But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey. I enjoyed this flight very much and full marks to Turkish Airlines offering a good business class product on a short haul flight.

And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight.

Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all.

Food and drink service was amazing, we were first handed packs of peanut followed by a drink service, then dinner. The food was really good, and was filling for one person. Drinks were provided throughout the flight. IFE was good, and there were plenty of films and series. One complaint is that there were some random episodes of some TV Series (like Season 4 Episode 5-6-7 of a series). Crew was helpful and unlike other Turkish Airlines flights I've taken, they were able to have an actual conversation in English.

Check-in was very quick at ORD airport with kind and very polite agent. Boarding was in order and a separate boarding line for Business class and Elite members. On board was greeted with a warm welcome. Pre takeoff had a glass of Champagne which was perfectly chilled and really enjoyed. Push back was on time. Very professional crew on board in business class. Chef came around and introduced himself and handed over the menu and later took the order for main course. Had ordered special meal AVML (Asian vegetarian meal). I was bit disappointed with the special meal as they have been serving the same food for more than a year now. Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product, catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from. The only complaint I have is, that they do not come and ask or refill the drink you are enjoying.

This delay meant a missed connection. There was no one from Turkish Airlines to help or assist.

They did not provide any meal and when I asked for a hotel they made me pay for the visa. The next day they asked me to be ready to go to the airport but they did not come and pick me up. Hotel management contacted the airline and they said I should keep waiting. An hour before the flight time, I decided to take a taxi. Due to a flight delay, I managed to catch my flight.

However there was a snafu on this trip. I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world).

Fully flat bed seats were comfortable but food service was disorganized. Very pleasant staff was running back and forth with individual dishes and glasses in very inefficient fashion. The major problem for us occurred in the Istanbul business class lounge. Our wait time between the flights was 10 hours, and we expected to be able to use their sleeping rooms for at least several hours. To our surprise we were informed that we are not eligible because the rule is that only customers with a wait time 3-7 hours are eligible! We pleaded to let us stay for a shortened period to no avail. After complaining to manager, we were offered an accommodation in an outside hotel (we would need to procure visa and arrange transportation). Before our departure from Canada I inquired by phone if we can reserve the sleeping space because of our long wait and was told that is on first come first served and no mention of the rule. Would we know that there was the stupid rule we would have reserved a hotel room within the airport. On our arrival in Istanbul it was of course fully booked.

2018-02-01,"""Overall we were impressed""",9,"✅ Trip Verified |  At half the price for a return trip from Heathrow to Cape Town with other airlines, Turkish Airlines' business class offering was too tempting to pass by, even if there was the inconvenience of transiting via Istanbul Take-off for LHR to IST was delayed by an hour, which was a concern given that we had just 1 hr 40 minutes between the scheduled landing and take-off for the IST-CPT leg. Having the full flat-bed experience for a short-haul flight was a real luxury and Turkish Airlines win hands down for providing this. Food on board was adequate and of the standard that BA now provide in Club Europe. Wheeling a trolley around loaded with foil-topped main courses didn't seem the best way of using the sky chef on board. Landing at IST was delayed by congestion and we'd almost given up on making the next flight. Getting to the terminal was helped by the airline providing a separate bus for business class. Details of gates for transit passengers was helpfully provided on board. IST is unbelievably chaotic, even at 1:00 am, but staff were around to direct passengers, and it was then just a matter of a frantic dash to the gate. Amazingly, we arrived just in time for boarding, but there was then another wait for the bus to fill to take us to a far stand. The food service on the IST-CPT leg was astonishingly good, and the role of sky chef was much more in evidence, with individual plating up of all the courses and a trolley circulated with desserts. A breakfast menu was also offered just after boarding, which allowed us to choose as much or as little as we wanted. Even the scrambled eggs were good! Disembarkation at CPT was quick, immigration was a breeze and we collected our bags just 10 minutes after landing.

2018-02-05,"""above average business class""",8,"✅ Trip Verified | Cape Town to London via Istanbul. It’s a shame that Turkish Airlines use the Bidvest lounge at CPT because it’s one of those pay-to-enter places that’s stuffed with passengers gorging themselves with food. Boarding for the CPT – IST flight started an hour before take-off, which seemed excessive. The business class cabin has a utilitarian décor of shades of grey – no middle-eastern bling or graduated, coloured lighting here. The staggered 2:2:2 seating pattern affords reasonable privacy, although passengers in window seats still have to climb over their neighbour’s legs. Cabin crew use a counter at the front of the cabin to prepare the food and drink service; it’s probably best for that to be done behind the scenes. It was good to have WiFi, even if it was rather slow. The Bentley night bag, Denon noise-cancelling headphones and large-screen IFE with a touch-screen remote were impressive. So, too, was the separate menu card for ordering breakfast in advance. The food service got off to a flying start with LED candles, laying out one’s tray and then the starter options where wheeled past. In principle, one could have as much as one wanted. The meze and mushroom soup were delicious. Less good were the main courses, which were, curiously, both overcooked and barely warm. A trolley of desserts and a cheese plate restored one’s faith in the presence of the on-board chef. Wines were largely Turkish, but the cabin crew seemed clueless about them. The cabin crew in general were efficient but somewhat robotic. Announcements from the cockpit lacked the friendliness of British Airways pilots. Sleep was hindered by the over-hot cabin temperature and being woken three hours before landing for the breakfast service – at 3 a.m. But at least breakfast was a cut above the usual and a feta omelette was actually pleasant. Landing was on time and we were bussed separately to the terminal. The double-level Turkish Airlines CIP lounge is vast, offering 24/7 service, unbelievable square meterage and questionable activities to pass the time. I suspect that if anyone started playing the piano on the dais they’d be asked to desist in case it put the indoor golfers off their stroke. Frankly, it was all too much. For the second leg of IST – LHR, we were on a 777-300 with a 2:3:2 configuration in business class. Thankfully the cabin was less than a third full, so we opted out of a second breakfast and caught up with some sleep. Again, the luxury of a flat bed on a short-haul flight takes some beating.

After reserving the flight we contacted Turkish Airlines helpdesk on Twitter (@TK_HelpDesk) to ask if they could reserve a bassinet for us and confirmed the ticket and paid after we were assured that would not be a problem. All fell apart 40 days later when we actually got on the plane and there were no bassinet seats available and the plane looked like it was fully booked. The crew asked a couple of people of they would want to change, but all refused. Later we learned they paid extra for the seats with the bassinets. A 10 hour night flight turned into a sleepless horror story trying to keep the baby balanced on our laps for hours. The space was so limited we had no possibility to eat a thing and without any possibility for air to flow things got really sweaty.

2018-03-07,"""I missed my connecting flight""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. My nightmare started when I missed my connecting flight from Istanbul going to Dubai. I was sent from one person to another there after and subsequently had a buy a visa ($30) at the airport in other to get to their ticket counter. At the ticket counter, the guy at the booth told me I had to pay $600 penalty for missing my flight and then another $2000 for a new ticket because I bought my ticket from an agent. There was no talking to him after that as he dismissed me when I told him there was no way I could pay him $2600. With the help of a very kind gentleman at the airport, I purchased another ticket to Dubai with Air Arabia. I had to leave Ataturk airport via taxi ($60) to another airport called Sabiha to catch the flight to get to Sharjah International and then subsequently to Dubai. When I went online to check, I was told my return was valid and secured and I even called the customer service line twice and was informed that I was checked in for my return. I was able to check in online and even change my seat for the return flight. I arrived at DXB airport at 4am February 22nd morning, waited for the check in counter to open at 5:20am to check in, only to be told by the agent at the desk that I could not fly out with them. He told me that since I broke the sequence and did not pay the $2600 in Turkey, my ticket was no longer valid. He also told me that they had neither a customer service counter nor a ticket counter in Dubai so my only option was to call the same customer service that previously assured me that I was confirmed to fly back to Houston with their airline. I had to be back in Houston so I had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Emirates. I had to take a shuttle to terminal 3, bought a one way business class ticket for $5440 just to make it back to Houston.  Telling a passenger to pay $2600 for missing a connection is unconscionable. The staff are rude and inhumane, Ataturk airport is chaotic and Turkish Airlines does not care about its passengers regardless of if you're flying business class or economy.",Business Class,1,1,1,,1,no,1176,Solo Leisure,Houston to Dubai via Istanbul,February 2018,Boeing 777-300ER,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I had an early breakfast (this was quite adequate, although I would have liked a little more given no dinner the previous night). No further food was offered. I think that the airline would be better off allowing passengers going straight to sleep and then having breakfast and lunch as the two meals on this long flight.

I have no clothes for 8 days and Turkish Airlines are refusing even to compensate me for the lost bag. 2) When we changed our travel date due to a medical emergency supported by a letter from the hospital, Turkish Airlines charged me and my wife 1200 extra dollars per ticket and refused to waive any fees due to the medical emergency like all other reputable airlines. 3) On a number of occasions I missed my connections due to late arrival to Istanbul (on Turkish Airlines) and Turkish Airlines refused to take any resposibility for missing my meetings by flying me on a different airlines flight.

Fortunately, some of the medications, which my husband had in his possession, were couriered to me from New York. To cut a long story short, finally after my bag reached its destination, instead of the airline delivering the bag, I had to collect it from La Guardia airport.

The chef in my opinion not a professionally trained chef but more a steward. The idea is a not a bad one as it gives the impression of a more dedicated service. However, the food is quite poor, and the drinks offered not a large selection. The staff were all very pleasant to me. Arriving at IST the business lounge, supposedly the best in the world, was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed. I wrote to Turkish and after a large exchange of emails I gave up. They insisted it was open. I was there, it was closed!! Their website is a mess, their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling.  They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half.

I could only get to it after logging into my TK miles & smiles account. After lengthy email exchange I was told my one way business class ticket for > 2,000 $ was too cheap for this that is still ok but very low. I noticed my record showed my TK ff number, which I do not use as I collect bonus miles on UA. So on Checking in BKK I verified they had my US number they confirmed and even read it back to me. In ISt I noticed my TK account has miles deposited so I emailed, no reply. : After arrival I again noticed TK had deposited the miles  obviously I lost all my gold bonus.: So I called TK - what a nightmare to even find a phone number and a person.

I would be a couple pages if I write exactly how many mistakes their agents made and how I got ripped off because of their mistakes! When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination. In Istanbul, I was told by an agent to wait in a line for boarding pass and when I reached front desk the person there said she couldn't find my ticket! Again, after I showed my online booking she said that because my flight is from the other airport I should go there and get my boarding pass! I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight! So, I had to pay a fee that was about 10 times higher than a single other flight that I could book at the same time with another airline! Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there). This is one of the worst and incompetent airlines that I traveled with.  The only scenario that I can think of that you will have a pleasant flight is if nothing and absolutely nothing wrong or just a bit uncommon happens. Nobody knows what they are doing and it's surprising. Even when I wanted to find my bag at the previous airport when I went there, I talked to at least 5 Turkish Airlines agent about it and everyone was sending me to a different direction and was saying a different thing.

The flight took off 2.5 hours late despite the gate agents insistence that the delay was only for 30 minutes. On board the crew were friendly and professional. The seat was OK in upright position but uncomfortable in lie flat position due to worn out cushion. Food was tasty but the wine list is in need of a refresh as they have been serving the same selection for 2 years. IFE has a good selection but I opted for sleep given the very late departure time. Lavatories were in decent shape but the sink could have used a bit more attention. Due to late departure, the flight landed late resulting in many missed connections. Although the delay was not really the airline’s fault as Beijing was having a late winter snowfall, the communications around it were totally misleading.

The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am (6 hours late). I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some don’t. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600€ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didn’t really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just don’t care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight.  These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They don’t stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They don’t even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong, that’s just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline.

I then worked on trying to get accommodation close by, after being in the airport for a day and half, coffee shop for a day/night as I had no where to go and then finally find accommodation. Finally when gathering my paperwork, Turkish airlines then refused to even honor the ticket they denied me entrance on, so I had to find an extra $600, post $575 I had paid to get an interview with the Embassy, and accommodation costs, as a part-time student, they simply emailed me with the audacity of speaking to me like an incompetent person.

The in-flight services were very poor, poor in-flight entertainment, cabin crew was rude and food was awful (on one of my 4 flights they served only meal which was non-veg and insisted that one has to pre-book ""special meals"").

As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable.

Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this won’t be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines. Service on board is mostly good with the onboard staff mostly very friendly and caring. Airplane age can be a hit or a miss with some very old and some reasonably new.

2018-05-17,"""told my return had been cancelled""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  On a recent ‘round-trip’ experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didn’t move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them.

The flight times changed three times, no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and don't call the airline to say you agree with the changes, your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg, but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them, which would have been fine except that my son, who is 5'11"" tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position, my daughter who is 5'4"" tall, could not put her legs in the forward position! On our return trip, I tried for two days to reserve and pay over $210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process, but it ultimately failed, as well. Each time the process failed, I would log out, then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved, but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card.

The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didn’t work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless. If you can opt for another European Airline instead of THY, please do so. ",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,1229,Business,Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul,May 2018,,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

My last meal was around 2.30PM. I was  without food for 8 hours and because of my stomach problems, I started cold sweats, and had to take my medications to calm my stomach. I did have food with me, but because I stowed my bag in the overhead bin, I needed a flight attendant to help me take it because I am really short, and could not reach for it. I pressed the flight attendant button, but no one came. In the meantime, my friend who is in business class was saying that they were being fed non stop since they boarded until around past 10PM. Is it possible that all the flight attendant were there in the business class and our dinner was being deferred? I have flown countless times over the past 2 decades, and this is the first time I have been in a plane which did not serve food after the fasten seat belt sign turns off, considering that we only have 10 hours of flight, and another meal will be served before we land. The attention of the flight attendants to the economy class passengers is really poor. During the round trip flight, I was looking for someone to compliment for looking after me, even for just one bit of help, but no one i asked for help ever met my low expectations. This airline has a lot to learn from South east Asian airlines. Another problem. I asked my travel agency to get me a bulkhead seat. My travel agency said that the Turkish airline confirmed that I had a bulkhead seat both ways. Unfortunately, on both travels, my seat on both legs were behind the bulkhead seats.

I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight.

I am sad to say it wasn't, the seat is fine pretty run of the mill business class, does what it says on the tin and had a decent sleep. Where Turkish airlines fails is in its customer service onboard along with the business class menu. Firstly the service on board, there wasn't any real interaction from the crew with their customers, menus' were given out and I was hurried to complete the breakfast menu for later in the flight, welcome drinks were not served until 20 mins after boarding, and champagne had to be requested. The main meal was served, and although it looked pretty it was pretty bland, I chose the chicken, it was dry and tasteless, I have had economy meals in the past and this spread was very much that but served on china. Way below what I have experienced on other carriers. The breakfast meal was just as bad, mainly all choices are based on eggs. Customer service on board, i had the feeling that the crew looking after its business class passengers were lacking in training to work in this part of the cabin, this was apparent from the lack of interaction, the crew spent all the time they could behind the curtain in the galley talking, never walking the cabin to see how their guests are.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,1262,Solo Leisure,Manila to Istanbul,July 2018,Boeing 777,1,1,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I tried explaining your employees about my special circumstances and hoped for some sympathy and possibly help. What actually happened was the complete opposite! I was mistreated and responded with apathy. I know and understand all airlines follow the same protocol but this was even worse than speaking to heartless robots. I asked customer service to please help me out and give me lounge access or even just a wi-fi that works so I can inform my family and friends I'm not going to be on time for the funeral or possibly find an earlier flight.

I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didn’t know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, it’s ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to it’s revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldn’t detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight!

I notified the flight attendant, she said ok go back to the end of the plane. I refused to do so! She called the manager , and she told me that those people will not not leave their seats and that’s I have only two options, either to leave the flight immediately and wait for the next flight or to go and accept seat 20C.

A disappointing start to our family holiday of a lifetime! Shocking customer service. No communication. Rude, aggressive and miserable staff. Disgusting airport in Istanbul, the list could go on. We were left for over an hour on our flight from Gatwick – Istanbul, the captain came on the radio once to say we were delayed, obviously! No communication whatsoever. Cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. The plane then started moving, followed by taking off yet no checks to see if passengers were sat down or even with their seatbelts on. The plane just took off, not even an announcement was made. We missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles in Istanbul where 9 of us including a 4 year old had to wait at the airport for 17 hours. They were unaccommodating, rude and their customer service ability was non-existent and shocking. They said we could stay in a hotel if we paid for the hotel, taxi and visa. We were left at the transfer desk for 4 hours where we were just repeatedly told wait. They couldn’t tell us anything or help us in any way. When they finally did sort our boarding passes out they had missed one of us off. After 4 hours they then said we could have a food voucher and a rest area, this was gone 4 hours of asking and waiting. When arriving at the rest area the lady working said we couldn’t go in because we had the wrong passport. She found it funny when we pointed out to her that we had a 4 year old asleep in a trolley. She was laughing with her colleague which was infuriating and highly unprofessional. The toilets were disgusting. Another delayed flight made us miss yet another connecting flight to Dubai this time, this resulted in another 9 hours at Dubai airport. It took us 72 hours to get to the Seychelles where we missed 2 days of our holiday. We didn’t think we would have the same carry on returning, unfortunately we did! Another 5 hour delay for what reason it was unknown. Going back to that desk at Istanbul with again rude and unhelpful staff was soul destroying. They then put half of our group in Business class half in economy. An absolute shambles.

Service onboard was good with nice meal for a 3h flight, and crew was a very friendly. The only issue was that they was that they didn't provide gate info for the next flight from Istanbul and our 55 minutes layover was only 40min because of delay on first flight, so we had to run for the most remote gate. Flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was older B777 with 3-3-3 config, with legroom thais equal to Emirates B777 but wider seats. IFE not at the same level as Emirates and old screen.

There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to off-load them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. It’s the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that I’ve ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late, there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced, only to be told that we were all off-loaded. Disgrace, unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. I’m amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub, when it can’t even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience.

But, Turkish wins hands down in terms of bad experience. I dare say even budget airlines are better. Turkish Airlines delayed the first flight from Dubrovnik to Istanbul by an hour which means there’s a high possibility of missing my connecting flight. When I arrived in Istanbul, earlier flights are listed on the board showing which gate to go to. Since it isn’t there, I asked an airport crew where should I go. He rudely told me “check on the board.” If the plane has flown, it’s basic courtesy to inform me instead of telling me which gate to go to. After running all the way, I saw an empty gate. I went to a Turkish Airlines counter only to be sent from one counter to another. I was sent to other 4 counters in total. How you handle this situation is horrendous.

Then he wanted me to verify my residence in Istanbul and other details which he had no business asking. It was as if he was punishing me for not upgrading for an additional $250. He was not a customs officer nor a representative of the Turkish embassy whom i had provided financial details and following which they had granted me my visa. When i showed him my hotel booking he asked me to leave the counter. The entire experience was unlike anything i have encountered before and what shocked me even further was that upon submitting a complaint to Turkish Airlines, I received a standard PR generated response which was frankly laughable.

Boarding started without an announcement and despite a clearly marked priority lane, it was a free for all with people forming multiple lines converging at the same spot. When I questioned the gate agent about the lack of announcements and the chaotic boarding, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said we were being bussed to the aircraft and in her mind it did not matter. On board the hard product was very good with real business class seats unlike the other European carriers which simply leave empty the middle seat of a 3x3 configuration in economy. After take off, we were served a tasty lunch with three different choices of main course. Beverage offering was decent and included champagne but the red wine was disappointing. The service by FA’s was good but it seemed quite inefficient with the two serving the rather small business section running back and forth multiple times to deliver a simple drink request. The seats were comfortable and the IFE had a good selection. The flight pushed back late but arrived on time. The landing was a little unnerving when the aircraft touched down very hard and there was absolutely no explanation from the flight deck. Overall it was a good experience especially on board and in the lounge however, the Turkish Ground Services which is a contracted service, is major downside of this airline.

Check in at Manchester was fast and efficient in business class, the reason for that would become apparent later. Plane was due to depart at 1100 but when we went to the gate as advised, the inbound passengers were not being allowed to deplane as the next gate along was loading for departure and presumably the staff were worried that the passengers might get confused. Eventually, we boarded and found we had the business class cabin to ourselves. Plane left 45 minutes late and the service during the flight was, as to be expected, superb. Food was good and tasty and we were able to sleep on this section. The cabin crew were very good. Because of the delay, we were short of time in Istanbul and were ushered straight to our next flight bypassing security. The flight from Istanbul to Ercan was aboard a A321 with the 2+2 seating layout. Boarding for this flight was chaotic as is normal for this airport. The flight was only 1 hour 20 minutes so it was not too bad, but premium economy would be a better description of the business class cabin.

Well as it turns out, first impressions didn't quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn't. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR. Case is not yet closed.

However, this is all minor stuff - what really annoyed me is for the second leg of my return flight (Istanbul to London) they seated me and my partner apart. This is despite the fact that we booked our tickets ages ago! Forgetting common sense, you would have through it pretty basic - wherever possible, seat people who book together, together. It's not rocket science! Despite a call from Addis to Istanbul (which annoyingly cost me over £20) to their call centre - there is nothing they can do about this!

What followed was both underwhelming, and, quite frankly, offensive.

Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them.

Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce.

This should be a thing of the past when Turkish Airlines moves to the New Istanbul Airport in early January 2019. A quick walk over to the International terminal and then boarded my flight to Montreal on a A330-300. The flight crew was excellent and had a good grasp of english. They were friendly and helpful. The infotainment system on Turkish is excellent with a wide assortment of movies, tv shows, and I loved the live TV. Two very tasty meals, a good selection of drinks, and snacks available in the galley throughout the flight. The restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight as I could see the flight attendants checking them often and cleaning if needed. The return flights were the same, excellent staff, bathrooms kept clean, food was very tasty. The only downside was having to be bussed to the International Terminal at Ataturk and it was pouring rain, the stairs had no cover. One of my bags didn't make the transfer to Izmir in Istanbul, but I reported it to Turkish Ground Services in Izmir, and it was promptly delivered the next morning.

We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport. This was my worst flight ever, I didn't receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the Turkish Airline staff, but I was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight.

I barely could catch my transit flight after a very long, chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of Ataturk Airport to the other.

Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FA’s did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them. Whilst most of my on board experience has been pleasant with TK I am appalled to see that their FA’s do not enforce the most basic safety rules and simply ignore violations.

The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time.

Turkish Airlines insisted that they will leave on time, instead we were all boarded and locked inside the plane, on the ground for 3.5 hours! Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased.

So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me it’ll be 45 min and they can’t mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by  and nothing.

2018-12-22,"""worse than a low-cost airline""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut. We have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. To start, we have booked our Christmas tickets on July 1st to secure a place for a fair price. The night before the flight. We go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from Istanbul to Beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from Brussels. The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100€ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360€ per person to 680€ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn't do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. To try to rectify the situation, I have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. After staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. Missed our solution option with the plane leaving. I stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. Our file is ""still in process"" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. This company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. Insults the customer and their intelligence. Hires people who neither have the proper English nor the empathy to deal with a client. Is frustrating and shameful. I am missing important family moments I have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. As for recommendations if you want to go to Beirut. Pegasus, a low cost, is much more efficient and respectful.

I visited the United Airlines lounge near the gate which was large, modern, clean, had friendly staff and had wide selection of food and drinks. After staying in the lounge I headed to the gate early like it said on the time board but I had to wait at the gate very long and the queue as disorganized and passenger both business and economy were held for another half an hour before boarding. After boarding, I got welcomed by the crew handed out a welcome drink and a menu for lunch. The seat was fully flat, modern and comfortable but the remote control was old and the distance to the magazines was unacceptable and the storage areas was poor. The flight was delayed as the traffic at Heathrow was bad. The in-flight entertainment system which had wide selection of movies, TV programs and many more. The meal was served an hour after takeoff, the food made up of Turkish food which was nice but it tasteless and the option in the menu was poor. The toilet was clean and modern. The flight arrived on time in Istanbul. The airport was crowded, old and had lack of renovation. Fortunately, I had an access to the lounge which was large,clean but crowded, lack of food options and seats. I spent and hour before head to the gate for my flight to Bangkok. The airport was huge and I nearly missed the priority boarding as the time board show the gate late. The service and facilities was the same as the previous flight but the seat included the amenity kit which is really useful on this 10 hour flight. The crew weren't friendly on this flight and not motivated. The flight arrived in Bangkok in the afternoon on the next day on time. I received another priority pass to went through the passport control. My bag arrived on time also. Overall, the airline itself had a good service and business class facilities but the crew should be more friendly and the airport issues should be fixed.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,1375,Solo Leisure,London to Bangkok via Istanbul,December 2018,Boeing 777-300er,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I booked my tickets last minute, it was for me and my 4 month old son. I had 3 suitcases a stroller and 2 carryons. I had paid for the suitcases, but because I was traveling alone I went there with my husband and he politely asked if they could please take the carryons on the plane because she can’t carry everything by herself. The manager came out and said that we have to pay. I said I already paid extra for my suitcases please help us because my wife is carrying our son, the diaper bag and 2 carryons. He was rude stating that we have to pay each carryon. We didn’t have the extra money and my wife took everything with her. If that’s how Turkish Airline treats their customers, they shouldn’t be operating. It was the last time I use this airline. No dignity or humanity, it’s all only about the money. And when I took the stroller with my son.

At this point I could no longer wait, and had to fly back to Berlin. My original return would have been the day before. I spent two hours at the Turkish Airlines transfer desk with a lot of insisting and nerves to finally get this changed at the last minute to the next plane on the same day. The services there was just awful (around 1300 on Dec. 19). Initially I was told, ""everything's ok, just sit there, and we will deliver the ticket to you."" But as time went on and no one came, I had to go back to the desk and basically start from scratch, dealing with altogether 5 or six officials who spoke hardly any English and were disorganised to the point of reminding one of headless chickens.

They have EU Family visas and no return ticket is required. We were forced to purchase 3 tickets that were not needed at a cost of R27,000. The flight was delayed almost one hour due to a technical problem. Due to this delay we missed the connecting flight to Toulouse. Turkish Airlines staff were incredibly unhelpful and uncaring. The sales desk demanded I buy new tickets at a price of R40,000 ($2,800) and I refused. Customer service was pathetic. The helpline from the sales desk needed a Turkish speaker to understand the process. I was on the phone for over 30 minutes twice explaining what had happened, and was told to to wait a few hours. They would call or email me; but there is no free WiFi or cell phone signal in the arrival terminals. I checked in every couple hours for 12 hours.  The sales desk said they could not give me free connecting flights as the flight was full and the cost was R40,000 ($2,800). They could give me next day tickets to Paris, which is at least 8 hours drive from my destination.  Istanbul airport staff in general were a nightmare to speak to in English, with an attitude of indifference. They were callous and rude at every encounter even though I was friendly, polite and upbeat. From 6 am until 2pm we had no access to proper food or drinks, except pretzels and sweets from a kiosk.  We slept in the airport on the benches - my wife and I with two hyper active kids aged 6 and 8. It was a nightmare. Waited 24 hours before the next flight, and 12 of those hours we were anxious and traumatized by the situation and staff. Arrived in Paris next day, only to find baggage had not been forwarded. This after I had discussed how the baggage worked. I saw the consultant print the new baggage tags and make changes on the system. Filled in the missing baggage report at the airport. Baggage arrived 5 days later by courier. Broken. The telescopic handle was broken off and the hard case was cracked about 15 cm. A soft case had holes in from friction. I've reported this to customer service and received no response except an automated message.  I've attempted to claim compensation on the baggage delay, but the website form doesn't work. We came from super hot summer in South Africa to - 2 degree winter and needed to buy new shoes, jackets and other basics for 4 people at a cost of $800. The airline has made no attempt to contact me or to redress the damages.

I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn't select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was ""it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass"""" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn't have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I'm not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight!

The cabin of this new 737 was clean and bright, for a economy seat the legroom was ok with a standard seat pitch of 34 or so inches. A cheesy safety video was shown before takeoff featuring lego figures. A little too cheesy after been shown twice, once in Turkish and once in English. Drinks were served after take off in a punctual fashion and was soon followed by a superb in flight meal of lamb kebab and rice, a good looking vegetarian Dahl was available too. Drinks included average wines and rice beer, along with soft drinks and Turkish coffee. The cabin crew where good and well turned out, including a chef working in the galley for business class passengers. The rest of the flight was fine. This plane did not feature IFE, other than some magzines. We were disembarked at a remote stand and spent 20 minutes on a bus trundling across a dark airfield to a packed transfer hall.

Got to the departure longue to find utter chaos, 100s of local people trying to board a flight, each carrying with 3 or 4 cabins bags, wedding dresses, quilts and electrical goods. The Turkish airlines staff did their best to bring control and remove bags from shopping happy Uzbeks. The boarding sequence did not work either. Reminds me of a rugby scrum at its best. We were bussed out to a well used aircraft with a very dated cabin. When I got to my window seat I found both seats full of stacked bags. Which had to be removed to the frustration of their owner. Turkish Airlines had an extra 6 or 7 staff on the flight trying to move what seemed 2 tonnes of bags into the hold and to sit people in there assigned seats. The flight had a delayed takeoff, which gave you time to look at a very tired interior, seats were old and lacked support. Leg room was zero and there was no IFE or video screens. The crew gave a manual safety demo and had to control people who wanted to change seats. The flight itself was OK, there was a basic drinks service and a simple meal of kebab meat and rice, there was no vegetation options that I could see off. The crew enforced a strict liquor policy from take off which worked well. Landing was OK and we where loaded into a bus from a remote parking space.

People standing closest to the door where on 1st. This ruffled a few business travellers big time. The airplane was a well used and tired aircraft, the interior was well used & featured cramped and un comfortable economy seats. Boarding was swift and the crew did a manual safety briefing, before a quick take off. The inflight services was a limited range of drinks and tea.

2019-02-10,"""zero customer oriented""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am flying from Vienna to Singapore with a layover in Istanbul for 11 hours. I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to it´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me ""No, tour is finished"". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that's what I'm doing now). I would like to highlight that all I wanted was to do the tour on my way to Singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen.

Another option is to take another flight but had to wait for another 9 hours. We took the first option because Turkish airlines promise that our luggage will be sent to Sabiha airport when we landed. Once landed, waited for around 45 mins - 1 hour for our luggage but none arrived including others that took the same option as ours. Few minutes later one of the staff came and informed us that all the luggage are left in Vienna. This became even more chaotic as passengers have other arrangements and obviously requires the luggage. The staff told us to file baggage lost at the counter and the queue itself took almost 2 hours. Turkish Airlines again made another promise that they would send it by the next morning to our hotel but again we still have not receive our luggage the next morning.

There is a lot of confusion both in the cockpit and at the Istanbul transit area. Passengers are given the wrong information.

That just about put paid to everyone's plans to catch their connecting flights. The gate number for my Geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as I found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). Very stressful. On board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. English is not great unless pre-recorded. Male crew are quite patient and hard-working. The female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. Sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be.

Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment.  This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the “Transfer” station where we can request to be booked to another flight.  We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they don’t give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wife’s US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours  and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind.  We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers.

2019-02-20,"""not friendly nor attentive""",4,"✅ Trip Verified |  Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The ""Onboard Chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite.

2019-02-21,"""book a different airline""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Lisbon via Istanbul. In April, I booked a flight from Dubai to Lisbon for $530.90 with Turkish Airlines. When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-in… After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasn’t going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasn’t I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, I’ve had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund. On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything that’s happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlines’ fault and that they didn’t follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me.

Every time I’ve tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me they’ll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but it’s been 2 months now and I haven’t heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didn’t they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that they’ll fully refund me, but aren’t now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what I’ve been through. It’s been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews).

2019-02-24,"""Never again will I use Turkish""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Never again will I use Turkish Airlines. We booked the ticket to Cape Town from Malaga (via Istanbul) 6 months in advance and chose Turkish due to the more direct route than having to travel to UK/Northern Europe or Middle East. We paid for extra legroom seats on all flights. One hour before leaving for the airport on our outbound date I received a phone call from the Turkish Airlines ticket desk at Malaga Airport to advise that the Istanbul-Malaga (second leg) of our return journey flight had been cancelled. They told us to go to the ticket desk when we arrived and before we checked in to be given options. The options were an 8 hour wait in Istanbul airport for the next flight (no thank you after an 11 hour flight) or the same flights a day later. We opted for the second option of flying on our original flight choices day later. The lady on the desk suggested that we claim afterwards for the extra hotel night and the extra day car hire. She also said that she could not book us the seats we had already paid for and that we should try to ticket desk in cape Town to do this for us. We checked in, we started to board, they got us all on to the air bridge where we stayed for about an hour before being moved back into the terminal. Then we boarded. The flight departed 90 minutes late with no explanation. The staff said that they did not know what the problem was. We arrived in Istanbul with a short connection due to the delay and after being bussed from the plane to the terminal we ran like crazy to get on the flight. We made it but our luggage remained in Istanbul. One case arrived a day later & the second case 2 days later. We collected the first case ourselves (as we thought they were both there) and went to the ticket desk to arrange the seats for the return journey. We had to leave all of our details with them as they were busy and unable to attend to it at the time. I e:mailed the ticket desk and customer services a number of times and each time the mails were returned with a message saying that the inboxes were full and could not accept any further mails. I also made a few phone calls but never managed to get an answer. After about a week I received a call from the ticket desk with an offer of slightly different but acceptable seats. When I told her about the issues I had ben having regarding contacting them she told me that the sales desk were very short staffed and that there actually isnt a customer service unit at all in Cape Town. During this time we were travelling with friends around the Cape and at times were without internet so communications were difficult. I also began the process of trying to claim for the emergency clothing items that we had to buy. I am still trying to complete the electronic form which keeps saying that I am giving wrong information (it doesnt specify what it doesnt like) and I am simply completing each box in order as it request me to do - along with the uploading of the files they request. I have tried to complete this form numerous times and in the beginning with help from the baggage handling company who confirmed that I was completing the form correctly. To this day I am still in communication with Turkish Airlines requesting them to reimburse me. They have refused to reimburse us with the cost of the hotel & car rental and are fobbing me off regarding the clothing cost.

I was only booked on the next flight leaving 24 hours later. I was not offered any accommodation or any facilities to help me care for my baby. Even the pushchair was not brought to me so at least the little one could sleep. In the past when I had traveled with them with my husband for much shorter stays we would be offered free food and drinks but didn't receive that as well. Because I was a woman with a small child and couldn't argue with them because my son was crying all the time, they just made sure I don't get any help, while I should have been offered more given the circumstances. In light of all this, my son and I suffered very much and it wasn't even our fault. Please avoid this airline they are the worst people to fly with. They pick on people who are more vulnerable and in need. I will never ever fly with this airline again. My problem is not with the delays, delays are part of traveling but when the airline gets it wrong they should have the moral standards to look after their customers especially when its a mother and a child.

Not only I made only preselection, I wrote to the menu that I am vegan, and the chef was aware i dont eat cheese as he asked me before flight. When I was served with appetizers, I was curious as they gave me a butter on a small dish. At first, I though it could be vegan as I was given butter previously, but that was on a pack, not this time.  I called the head steward and explain my conundrum. The chef came and explained and apologized. They insisted i ordered vegetarian as shown on their records, but I showed my confirmation email that I did preselect Vegan meal.

Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn't leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: ""Wait a minute"".. I didn't want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.?

In-flight entertainment: large variety of movies. Cabin crew: negligent and sloppy, to a frustrating level. So many episodes where they disregarded very simple requests from passengers or (worse) caused problems due to their disorganization.  Gate crew: at the check-in I chose a spot that would allow me to easily access the bathroom, that I need for medical reasons. At the gate the seat got striked through and I have been re-assigned, no explanations provided. When I asked for the seat to be changed to an aisle seat, I have been told by the cabin crew to temporarily sit on the assigned seat. After take-off, my request got ignored for the whole flight, regardless many seats were empty. Seats extremely unconfortable and impossible to sleep in (very old plane for a 10h flight). Mine was even broken so I could not sleep at all. Food service: chaotic to the point that some people started to serve themselves due to the fact that their requests were disregarded or forgotten. Overall a very bad experience that leaves me confused at how this company won any awards. At first I also gave it the benefit of the doubt that's why I waited to write the review but the return flight confirmed all the negligent behaviors I saw on the departure flight.

We were then given a hotel room outside the airport which needed us to spend 220 USD on an express visa to enter Turkey plus an additional 100 USD on travel. The airline doesn't give you rooms in the airport, which turns out to be more expensive for the passenger as there is no proper public transport to our hotel room and Turkish won't pay for it.

Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from İstanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days.  I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see what’s the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think it’s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that there’s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didn’t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because it’s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they can’t get it.

Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul. I flew with this company several times in the past years, and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse. I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul, all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish). The ground staff is for the most part useless. In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer  was: ""Relax Sir, No problem Sir, It's okay"". The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it's an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy. A complete disaster. I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future, it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay.

Not so great on the ground, ground staff, call centre, computer systems. My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff don’t speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later, but it wasn’t an easy process, made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also, I’d phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra £40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall, I think their cabin crew and planes are very good, ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1491,Business,London to Izmir via Istanbul,May 2019,,1,1,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

Horrible experience from start to finish with Turkish Airlines on our wedding/honeymoon trip from Kiev to Maldives. Sorry for the lengthy post. I will try to make it as concise as possible. Website and Mobile App issues: After creating my online profile, I needed to update my name to include my middle name, as it shows on my passport. Once my tickets were issued from Expedia, Turkish Airlines website and App couldn’t link the ticket to my Miles&Smiles profile because of the name discrepancy. It took several calls and emails to support, and even now it still shows my first name and middle name combined. Couldn’t update my rewards number: I mistakenly had the wrong Miles&Smiles number on my Expedia account when I purchased the tickets (copy/pasted without the last digit). Turkish airlines couldn’t update my ticket with the correct rewards number. Sure, it was my mistake, but it seemed like a simple request to update my ticket. Flight schedule change: Our flight times from IST to MLE on April 30th change from arriving at 11:50am to arriving 12:15pm, which was not a big deal, but logging into their website and App the system asked me to confirm the change, cancel the flight, or change the flight. There was no option to confirm the change. I couldn’t change my flight (which was free of charge). Every time I’d select the new flight arriving in MLE at 12:15, the system would say it couldn’t find a flight with that time. I made several calls to Turkish Airlines support, and they never helped me clarify if I was confirmed on the changed flight. The best they could do was tell me to contact Expedia and have them re-issue tickets. Between Turkish Airlines and Expedia support, I must have made a half dozen calls regarding this. By the end, Turkish airlines best response was that “everything should be fine”. All I wanted to know is that everything IS fine”. Cancelled flight from KBP to IST: As we were about to board our flight from KBP to IST on April 29th at 9:30pm, we were told at the gate that our flight was cancelled. • It took 6 hours to stand in line for new tickets. Calling customer support, the guy was rude and told me to just wait in line. When calling Expedia’s Gold customer support to get me a new flight, they were unable to assist because the Turkish Airlines flight was not showing an updated status, and that the flight was still on-time. Expedia could have helped me get new tickets, but they just needed to confirm the flight was cancelled. Expedia even called Turkish Airlines to get updates, and Turkish Airlines was unable to give them the cancelled status. So, after several calls to Turkish airlines and Expedia, we just continued to wait in line. We eventually got new tickets to IST, which left Kiev at 10am the next day (April 30th) and arrived in IST at 12pm.

But if your luggage gets damaged during the trip, be prepared to be treated as if it's none of their business, as with a low-cost airline. I feel lucky that the luggage was not lost at least. Here is what happened. First, the company claimed that the suitcase was already damaged when I had checked it in. In fact, I packed my coat into the suitcase in front of the check in desk right before dropping it, so I am absolutely sure that the suitcase was not damaged then. Someone replaced the label on the suitcase after the check it to mark it as already damaged at check in. The airline actually has a record of this in their system so the customer service staff could verify that this happened and issue a refund, but they never bothered. Upon my arrival in Doha, I have not had a chance to talk to the airline staff directly, so I was told by the airport staff to open a complaint by sending an email to the address of the airline's local office.

2019-06-01,"""don't care about passenger safety""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  On our Turkish Airlines flight from Tel Aviv to Istanbul, April 20, 2019 I experienced an incident as we were deboarding. There was a young woman who was speaking very loudly with her group. Thinking nothing of it, I stood up to get off the plane. A minute later she puts BOTH hands and me and shoves me to the side – into the seats - to get to her group. I can handle a little push, scootch past - but a two-handed forceful shove is too much. I told her to chill out and wait. She started yelling at me in another language (I don’t know which), taunting me and laughing at the back of my head - with her group laughing too. As we were getting off the plane, she was directly behind me and I stopped and informed the young female flight attendant stationed at the back of the plane that this woman - pointing to her - just forcefully pushed me with both hands. Flight attendant - no kidding - shrugged her shoulders and said ""So?"" Thinking she didn't understand, I repeated it. The FA then laughed aloud and said clearly ""Well, what do you want me to do about it?"" I said ""You are telling me that I can punch someone on this flight and you will do nothing?"" She laughed and again said ""What can I do?"". This was in front of my husband, the woman who pushed me and one of her companions. Shocked I got off the plane and at the bottom of the stairs I explained the situation to the ground crew and the Turkish Airlines Security that was on the ground to get us on the bus to take us to the gate. They told me ""Tell it to Customer Service in the airport."" Still stunned I argued and questioned ""You aren't going to do anything?"" They said ""Get on the bus."" At the terminal, I went to the customer Service and once they found someone who spoke even high school English I was told - no kidding - to call Customer Service. I could not believe this. Again, I said “I have spoken to the flight crew, security, ground crew, customer service but you are telling me I need to call customer service. I'm talking to you now!"" They said No. I said ""OK, can I use your phone?"" They laughed (so much laughing in this experience) and said ""We don't have a phone."" At no point did a Turkish Airlines employee say to me - ""Are you OK? "" Not once.

We could not detect any inconviences (sic) regarding your feedback."" I have written again & again & each time they tell me that no one corroborates my story. They never asked if I was OK, apologized for the inconvenience, spoke to the woman who forcefully pushed me, asked me my name, wrote anything down – nothing.

Nobody knows what is going on out there, the staff are new and extremely unhelpful and the general experience is grating from start to end. The airport is far to large to navigate conveniently and the quality of construction out there is disgraceful. So many corners cut to satisfy unrealistic schedules. It looks 20 years old already and I shudder to think what it will look like in only 5 years more. The transport links to the city do not exist and it's a consistent 30 minutes taxi from gate to take off. Avoid transiting with TA at all costs when their direct competitors in the ME are so far ahead for quality and service it is hard to believe. This giant white elephant airport is doomed to fail. These thoughts are in addition to the horrendous customer service I endured today while traveling with two small children and no partner. We had unforeseen delays at immigration of almost 1 hour yet (the only photocopy station is 300 yards away). Turkish Airlines shrugged their shoulders saying there was no way they could call the gate and let them know we were on the way. We ran the 15 mins to the gate and missed it by 2 mins. They then delay the flight to remove all our bags. You couldn't make the incompetence up. No effort, shrugged shoulders. Typical. The general Turkish Airlines service is appalling, despite being a top level frequent flyer. I fly them because I have to but I would choose any, literally other option going forward.

Seats have become more constricted - limited legroom, especially when the person in front reclines their seat! The food standard has declined substantially & punctuality of flights has become chaotic! Ground service is too often dismissive and unethical - inflight service is most often good.

I called them and was put through to a call centre in Turkey. The accent of the operator was so heavy I couldn’t understand them. After 20 minutes on the call I was told I had to visit Gatwick airport before the flight to change my ticket. This is untenable and ridiculous to expect someone to do this when they cancel a flight. I ended up getting a Turkish speaking friend to call them and they managed to exchange the ticket. But to a different London airport costing me more in taxis and taking longer to transfer for which I was not compensated and no apology. At Istanbul airport now on the flight I was moved to. The Turkish Airlines staff here are just rude and arrogant and do not care at all. The directions to the lounge are poor in the new airport. The staff do not look you in the eye. Do not care to help you. I think they know everyone is complaining so have became disconnected from their job. Just very poor service all around. This is why I choose other airlines now.

Advised next steps: wait until tomorrow a.m. 48 hours after my flight, and submit a lost baggage claim; which will start a process to “reimburse for lost luggage” or “expedite the search”. BTW – since I opted to get my flight terminated and paid $500 for my last leg of the flight, TK will not deliver my bag to my final destination. I will have to pay a FedEx fee for that. Still waiting for my bags!

2019-07-22,"""outraged and disappointed""",3,"Not Verified |  Houston to Istanbul. I am a mother of 2 children - 1 is 7 months old and the other is 3 years old. I spoke on the phone with a customer service representative with your airline for ticketing and reservations. I am outraged and disappointed in the terrible customer service and appalling company policy Turkish Airlines has for families with children. From my understanding with the rep and manager today, if a family is traveling with an infant, the only place they can sit is a bassinet accessible seat. In order to receive this seat with my family and babies - we have to pay an additional $109 per person, per seat - going both ways round trip! That’s over $600 extra for my family. This is a terrible policy and is basically punishing and penalizing families with infants. I have flown internationally on 2 other trips before with a different airline, and there was never  an additional fee to accommodate a family to be able to sit together with their infant, with a bassinet accessible seat. I am travelling with my 2 boys and husband. In addition to this my sister, her spouse, my mother and her spouse are also going to be on the same flight with us. Our entire family has already spent plenty of money as your customers for our flight and now we are being penalized and asked to pay additional money to have a bassinet seat?!? Turkish airlines is punishing families by enforcing additional financial burdens on families. After my conversation with the customer service rep and her manager, it is clear to me that the Turkish Airlines customer services reps only care about repeating, over & over, the company policy as an excuse or escape route to avoiding good customer services. Not once did they display any empathy or understanding that as a mother, I do not want to sit by myself with my infant son, and be forced to take care of all his needs, by myself, for a 12 hour flight. Long flights are difficult for babies and families and we need help to make sure its a safe and smooth flight for our children and family. After getting zero help from a customer rep and manager on the phone, I sent feedback online. I got the same  policy recited to me again. Again no compassion and understanding from this company of the difficulties traveling with children and babies.

Karachi to London via Istanbul. My disabled mother was flying back from Karachi to London. Her mobility scooter, which she uses as she can not walk, was checked in. When she landed and collected her baggage she noticed her mobility scooter had been crushed. She was mortified as it was a new scooter costing around £1800 and she does not have a lot of money so buying a new one is not so easy. She was taken to one of there offices were the person dealing with this matter told her not to worry at all and that they would get the scooter repaired ASAP and that she should take it back home with here and they would arrange collection. We then got a call from someone saying that they will not be collecting it but instead they asked my disabled mother to take the scooter to a repair shop, get a quote and send it to them and then they will pay for the repair. We did that and after 2 some time they got back to us saying that what we sent them was a quote and they need an invoice even though they asked for a writen quote. Anyway we send the invoice with a long message saying please try to resolve this quickly as my mother in confined until she gets her scooter back. They then replained with a one sentence answer saying 'We cannot evaluate this document. Thank you for your understanding'. Understand what, there was no explanation. I then had to call them, spent half an hour explaining the situation and they said it was because it was not an invoice, even though it clearly was. We then had to go back to the workshop and got them it change the invoice and sent it again. And there reply, you guessed it 'We cannot evaluate this document. Thank you for your understanding'. So again we called them up and this time they said because the invoice was not stamped by the company. Spoke to the company again, who at this point is fed up of us, and they singed the invoice as they do not have a stamp but told us they have sent many invoices and have never had this issue before. Sent the invoice again and there response 'We cannot evaluate this document. Thank you for your understanding'. We replied saying if you are not happy still with the invoice then can you arrange for a another repair shop to do the shop and there are no other places and my mother can not drive due to her disability and the scooter is extremely heavy. They said no. it has now been 6 months since the incident and still this has not been resoled.

2019-08-07,"""To me, that sounds like a scam""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had bought tickets for my flight from San Francisco to Kyiv via Istanbul in advance. Few days before the flight day I had called to Turkish Airline Customer service to double-check if everything has changed about my flight and the representative told me that they got only small updates about my way back tickets. They have changed the time for 5 minutes later and the airport. She did not mention anything else about my upcoming flight to Kyiv. After arriving at the airport to Istanbul I came to the Turkish airline front desk to ask them about the hotel service. Since my layout time is 13 hours they supposed to offer me to stay in the hotel, and for this reason, I have chosen this airline. It is their written policy. I’ve been waiting in the line for about 30 minutes. The representative told me that there is some update on my flight, they have alternative flight that is sooner than 13 hours and they cannot offer me the hotel, but at the same time they cannot offer me a new ticket to the alternative flight; moreover, I must pay extra money for that ticket. They changed the airport of arrival so why do I need to pay in this case? Is it legal at all? I just want to mention that when I was booking my tickets these 13 hours connection time and old airport were the only options. Their system does not show any other flights. After I have been waiting for his decision more than 30 minutes at the front desk, he told me that he even cannot check that alternative flight for me and provide with some more information about its costs or how can I get that ticket. He said that I need to go to another front desk that is after security check out. I went to another front desk and there was a huge line of yelling people who missed their flight because of the delay. I was patiently waiting for another one and a half hour in the line and after, another representative told me the same story that I must pay extra money for upgrading my ticket because they are not going to provide me the hotel room. They said that since there is another option for me to get to Kyiv earlier and I need to pay for that, they cannot give me the room. Representatives were referring to their policy about offering the free hotel room. I want to mention that six months ago when I was purchasing my tickets there were NOT other option with layout less than 13 hours, 13 hours layout was the only option on their website that’s why I bought it because they provide a hotel to stay that 13 hours. They told me that I can contact their manager which is located on Turkish Airline Hotel Desk after Passport control. I went there. After another long line I finally met 3rd different representative that told me the same story about their policy and referred me to the ticket exchange desk to exchange my ticket to a sooner flight, but he said that it is usually some small fee for exchanging but they cannot tell how much exactly and I need to go to another front desk. I went there and 4th representative announced that I must pay 150 Dollars to exchange my tickets to flight sooner! Is it some kind of joke? I have already paid for the tickets if the airline has changed their flight, why do I need to pay for that?

We flew along with 2 kids(3 & 6 year old ) and had a food allergy. Individual Seat assignments: Our seats were confirmed 25D,E,F,G but they re-assigned seats for all of us separately(30D, 24B, 19J, fourth boarding pass got missing in chaos but it was a separate seat) . We are having a hard time understanding how a 3 year old child can travel unaccompanied? When we asked for the reason, they did not have an explanation. We stood on the airplane gate for half an hour when finally they assigned, separately, two seats for mom and daughter together and two seats for dad and son together just before take off (gate was closed and we were literally standing on the gate whole time during boarding process). These seats were not even anywhere close together (Row 27 for mom and daughter and row 9 for dad and son). When I asked how this could happen when I had called and already had confirmed seats, the guy at the gate (part of cabin crew) was extremely rude and replied very rudely that he doesn’t know what happened but he is trying to help us find a seat. Apparently he did not think anything of letting a 3 year old and a 6 year old sit together. The two female flight attendants were a bit nicer and they said to him in Turkish that a child cannot sit alone (they were speaking in Turkish but I could tell that’s what they said because they pointed to my kids).  Staff is so unprofessional and rude. When we checked in, we simply asked reason for not assigning seats together (please note that I had called the airline and made sure that we have seats together), the person on the desk was rude and was not replying to our questions. He simply gave the reason, in broken English, that the plane has changed that caused the problem when we asked why it was taking so long to check us in and if everything was ok. However, plane was not changed and he simply lied to us. Poor communication skills: The big problem was, they don’t understand/speak English well. When we asked reason why they assigned our confirmed seats to someone else, the person on the check-in counter could not explain in English and he got frustrated as he as was trying to explain in broken English which was hard for us to understand. In his frustration, he stated showing his rudeness. The same situation was on the plane, whey they were trying to get seats for us, we asked crew members how did this happen? they simply could not reply in English and ultimately replied with rudeness, again it was language problem but I feel that the females were nicer than the man at the door of the plane, who was part of the cabin crew. The other guy was polite and ok who was serving me food but the guy at the door (part of the cabin crew) was extremely rude). He was the one we asked how this could happen when our flight was confirmed and he responded rudely. We asked if at least two of us could sit together behind each other (2 seats in front and 2 in back) and he said yes and told mom and daughter to follow him (all the way to row 27), yet dad and son were told to wait there and were given seats in row 9. Mom was waiting for dad and son to show up close to mom and daughter, but that did not happen. Dad in row 9, had to call a flight attendant and ask where mom and daughter were.

Eventually, I decided to purchase new ticket to go Kazakhstan without transit via Russia; however, a staff explain that if we miss or give up one of five flights, (there is five flights on our itinerary), rest of flights will be canceled as per an airline policy. so we have to flight to Russia in order not to lose all flights. so I called Expedia to see what is our option for this case. As I expected, we have to purchase entire new tickets which is $8,500. Expedia said that is only option since that is an airline policy.

So I started to convince them we will take all responsibilities even if we lose tickets. told me ""just let us fly to Kazakhstan then I will purchase new ticket to fly there without entering Russia and please just remove our name from the list of flight from Istanbul to Samara Russia"".

Onboard the hard product was showing its age scuffed panels and ripped fabric. As with most of my flights with Turkish the air was stale and the cabin too warm throughout the entire flight. Despite requesting the temperature to be lowered on multiple occasions, the entire journey was made uncomfortable due to the hot cabin. Upon takeoff, it took quite a long time for the service to commence especially considering this was an 11:45 p.m. departure. Dinner was quite tasty and wines and champagne were of decent quality. The seat was comfortable in the flat position but I missed the oversize pillow they used to provide with the bedding which was replaced by a regular size, small pillow you would find in economy. Breakfast had lots of choices but the hot entree was poorly prepared. The biggest let down was the coffee which was warm at best. I had not flown with TK for almost a year and the decline in quality was evident. The washrooms were dirty and the staff, despite being friendly, were inefficient in the way they looked after the passengers. The IFE had a good selection but I opted for sleep instead. The flight left and arrived on time but the new airport in Istanbul meant a very long taxi to the gate. It took another 30 minutes waiting for the doors to open as the jet bridges could not be attached and the aircraft had to be moved into position manually.

Check-in was quick and efficient however TK was unable to issue the boarding passes for our onward journey which was on Lufthansa. When questioned, the agent simply told us he did not know. Following check-in we proceeded to the Turkish Airlines  lounge which was as impressive as its predecessor at the Ataturk airport. Food and drink options were plentiful and there were many seating arrangements to choose from. Our experience went downhill after leaving the lounge to board our flight. When we got to the gate we were informed of a delay on departure but was not given a reason. When boarding commenced, they used 3 separate queues, one for priority boarding and two based on seat numbers however, they processed passengers from all 3 queues simultaneously creating a logjam on the jetway. As with all of my Turkish Airlines flights departing Istanbul, the gate agents were surly and spoke little to English. On board, the hard product was OK aside from not providing direct aisle access. Shortly after take off, we were served lunch with 2 choices for the main course. The food was sub par and drink choices were poor for business class. The crew were friendly but had limited command of English. As with most of my flights with TK, the cabin was too warm making it an uncomfortable journey. IFE had a wide range of choices and the wifi worked fine after several attempts to log in. The flight departed late but landed on time and the captain or the crew did not bother to explain the reason for delay.

My first one was a few years ago and that was normal. This one was bad. I booked a return ticket from Hong Kong to Kiev via Istanbul but I had an accident in Kiev and needed to change to the next day. The only way to do this was calling the Call Centre. I thought they fly to Hong Kong every day. The Call Center only changed my first flight (Kiev to Istanbul) to the next day, but not the second one, which was changed to more than 24 hours after the first one. The staff didn’t clearly say there was no flight to Hong Kong on the next day at the beginning. I just noticed that immediately after I paid USD 266. I even hadn’t hung up the phone and asked for a change. The Call Centre told me they would charge another sum of money for the change or only refund me USD19. Similar to other passengers complaints, this airline pushes to make whatever money they can when you are not alert enough. The Call Centre told me that I was eligible for a hotel stay at Istanbul Airport. But I was denied when I arrived, because there was a shorter connecting flight from Kiev to Istanbul. Why didn’t the staff tell me that when I made the change?

FA’s were pleasant and service was efficient. Food and beverage choices including champagne were of good quality and FA’s came around frequently asking if passengers wanted anything.

The initial flight was delayed for no obvious reason at Gatwick for two hours and half the plane had connecting flights with a 2 hour stop over. We managed to make up some time during the flight so the pilot drove round the airport a few times (yes we did all see you drive past the same building 3 times) deliberately making us miss our connections. We felt they had overbooked so did this on purpose. The next available flight was 24 hours so as a solo female traveller I was forced to stay in a hotel I felt very unsafe in in an extremely rough part of Istanbul booked by the airline. Checked in and was sent to a room where there already a naked man occupying it and in the shower (again not a great situation for either of us). Went to dinner in the hotel and was the only western female surround by around 30 Turkish men staring and making comments. Spend the next 24 hours in my room feeling anxious. Got the bus laid on by the airline back to the airport and the engine blew up on the motorway, driver got off, engine was smoking and said nothing to worry about!

Has Turkish Airlines heard of something called personal information protection or privacy? What if this staff was using that information or lost his phone? He was so rude when I told him this. Inflight entertainment is full of ads - it is like one of those spam websites or ultra-low-cost airlines with very limited movies and music, the newest movie they have is 1 year ago.

2019-10-18,"""I did not like the seat/bed""",6,"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Denpasar Bali. This was one of those flights which, unfortunately, was far from the high standards to be expected of Turkish Airlines. When I checked in I found that my seat had been changed from that which I selected a couple of months earlier, even though the seat configuration was unchanged. We were taken in a hot bus from the terminal to the aircraft, then made to wait as we couldn't board. An hour after take off they came to take a drinks order. I chose a gin and tonic and was offered ice and lemon which I chose. Almost half an hour after that my drink came. A glass with a small piece of lemon; no ice, and tellingly, not a single bubble in the liquid. I tasted it and suspect it was vodka and still water. I told the attendant it was obviously not gin and tonic and she said she would change it. But by now they had started serving dinner so I opted for a glass of wine, guessing they couldn't get that wrong. The salmon starter was excellent. After that I had selected the pea soup and fish. But she brought me chicken kebab. She changed it. I was asked what I would like for desert and I replied that I would chose from the trolley. She said they don’t do the desert trolley any more. I wonder if it doesn’t fit as the aisles are so narrow it is a squeeze for two people to pass. I had some delicious ice cream then the cheese plate. The latter was so cold and the cheeses so hard they had no taste. Also I had to ask for bread or crackers to go with the cheese. Then to sleep. First problem was getting flat. Although I am average height I couldn't get my feet far enough into the feet area to lower the rest of my body on to the bed. A steward saw the problem and explained that the only way is to raise the bed half up after they have made it. Lye down on it, then press the button and the bed moves me towards the foot space and my head goes flat on the pillow. Overall I did not like the seat/bed. Feels like being encapsulated in a black cube. Half of one window is blocked by the side of the “cube”, though it appears it could be cut away serving no purpose. The windows were set on dark all during the cruise, meaning impossible to see clearly out of the window even though much of the 12 hour flight was in daylight. Breakfast was good and uneventful. Arrival some 20 minutes early. Priority luggage came mixed with all the other luggage. To end on something positive. The increased hydration on the B787 had a positive effect and I got off the plane feeling so much better then I normally do after long flights.

So i decided to stay at Sofia for longer and come late but with possibility to have a free hotel. When time of the travel came I decided to write to the hotel desk in advance  and they told me that I am not eligible for it, cause there is another flight on the next day which is more closer in time and i had to book it.

I wrote several letters to their feedback center in order to complain and get any kind of help to change my tickets for free or get a hotel, but they didn’t help in any way and they said that they checked our conversation and didn’t find any mistake cause their workers are professional.

Unfortunately, the airline cancelled the first leg of the trip two weeks before scheduled departure. This meant I would miss my connection to my ultimate destination. I had to leave two days earlier than planned due to the cancellation. It also meant the exit row seat I paid for was no longer available. Normal businesses would refund this extra expense I paid for the exit row seating. After submitting a feedback request, the airline agreed to refund the money, however, six months later I still have not seen a dime of that money despite tens of feedback requests/emails. The airline has delayed, confused, made excuses, claimed no refund was needed, etc. all to try and frustrate me so that I would no longer pursue the refund. I also contacted the consumer protection division of the USDOT, who relayed my complaint to the airline. The airline again agreed to refund the money, but now continues to make unreasonable demands for me to receive the refund. The airline claims they can not refund the credit card used to make the purchase and insist on me providing a copy of my passport and bank account information. Coincidentally, I had a very similar experience on KLM about a month after my Turkish Airline flight. KLM was wonderful. They refunded my credit card within 5 days of the flight. The Turkish Airline flight was a terrible ten-hour flight that was very uncomfortable. I am tall at 6'2, the seat was not fit for a much smaller person. The aircraft was old. The plane had decor of the 70's and 80's and many of the video screens around me were broken, including mine. On the brighter side, the flight crew was pleasant and the food good. Outside of the uncomfortable seat, the flight would have been grand. On the return trip, I did sit in an exit row and can honestly say it was a very pleasant flight.

2019-12-20,"""mistreatment by Turkish Airlines""",1,"Not Verified |  I'm writing this review in my room in Yotel Air (hotel) inside Istanbul airport after having been denied my right to board a flight to Berlin with Turkish Airlines by a member of their staff earlier today (12:30 PM, December 19, 2019). I had to book a room in this hotel for an overnight stay and buy a new ticket for the earliest flight to Berlin tomorrow (December 20, 2019) without any compensation from Turkish Airlines. All this was due to the fact that said staff had no knowledge of Schengen visa regulations involving non-EU nationals/passports. I am devastated by this mistreatment by Turkish Airlines. I was supposed to fly with Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Berlin at 12:30 PM earlier today (December 19, 2019), but I was denied boarding by a ground staff member who was in charge of checking passengers' passports and boarding passes at the gate because he assumed that I did not have a VISA/permit to enter Germany. I explained very clearly in simple English that I did not require a VISA to enter Germany and the Schengen Area for tourism purposes for up to 90 days, as my country is included in one of the non-EU countries to which the VISA requirement does not apply (for tourism purposes). He dismissed my claim (which I understand, given the priority for security) and went on to make calls and texts to verify my claim. In the meantime, he made me wait on the side while he attended to all the other passengers who were entering the gate. Because there was no conclusive answer from the other side of the phone, he and his team decided to let the plane leave without me. Not long after the plane had left, he finally got a confirmation from ""Germany border controls"" that my claim that I did not need a VISA for visiting Germany was correct. Then, he took me to a Turkish Airlines booth (airside) to get me rebooked on another flight. After exchanging a few sentences with the Turkish Airlines ticketing team, he left there unattended. He did not say sorry to me. After waiting for four hours for a confirmation from the ticketing team about my next flight, they said to me that I would need to buy a new ticket because my original ticket was a ""promotional"" ticket. I defended myself saying that I did not miss my flight. Rather, I was denied boarding because one of their ground staff members assumed that I needed a VISA permit and did not have one. I rang Turkish Airlines's Customer Service to get help and explained the whole situation via phone and then email. After two hours, they responded to my email say they could not compensate me and even defended said staff for denying me my right to board the plane in the interest of protecting all Turkish Airlines's customers and passengers (was I not a customer?). What broke my heart was the Turkish Airlines team being adamant that it was somehow my mistake - they mentioned ""incomplete documents"", ""invalid visa"" etc. But I never needed a VISA in the first place. Finally, I had no choice but to buy another ticket for a flight the next morning and book a room at the hotel inside the airport. All this without so much as ""sorry"", let alone compensation. I'm now very apprehensive about going to Europe via Istanbul. I've been traveling to Europe since I was 18. I have never been denied boarding until now.

Due to a strike in Paris, we arrived 55min before takeoff instead of one hour and the baggage drop-off already closed. Of course, many others also arrived late with us. We ran to the Turkish Airlines service counter, as we thought their could be any chance to catch the flight. The guy told us sarcastically replied to our question what to do, ""drop your baggage into the garbage and go to the gate"" .. seriously?! You can tell this in another way that their is no chance to get with baggage on the plane. Than he offered us to change our tickets for around 2000 EUR per person, going four days later, which we refused. Calling Turkish airlines service centre brought us nothing but finding out that they cancelled our return flight which was scheduled one month later. I understand that missing the first flight is not their fault, but cancelling the return ticket is really not fair. They just want to resell a ticket that we paid for. As a nice gesture, the could at least keep our return ticket valid. We paid for that flight! My wife called Turkish airlines five times, sent three emails only to get different information each time. They make people wait in line for half an hour for nothing. They lie and tell that there is no refund at all although according to EU regulation they are obliged to refund at least the airport tax. Each time we call they tell us a different amount. Their behaviour is not professional. Finally, we wife told them that she wants to leave a complain message at the end of the call and they just kicked her out of the line. Enough is enough, this is our last time with Turkish airlines. Fortunately, the Iran air staff in Paris could help us and we bought a ticket to Iran on the same day only 3 hours later.

This bag contained all of our clothes, Christmas gifts, hair straighteners, hair drier, baby monitors, make up, all of our shoes and basically everything we needed for this holiday. The bag is still lost. I have contacted the airline numerous times and asked to speak to a manager, I also requested a call back yet not one person from the airline has contacted me. I filled in the form online yet I just receive the generic email in return. It has completely ruined the first Christmas of my daughter and husband in Ireland and I have had to pay a serious amount of money on new clothes as the bag is still lost and nobody seems to actually be looking for it.

TK335 departed from Baku with an almost 2 hour delay owing to the late arrival of the incoming flight. I had been irritated by the shortened connecting time at IST. It should have been 2 hours and a half. Staying comfortably at TK’s CPI lounge, one of my favorite, was gone. Still, I had been worried that I could catch my homecoming flight. No explanation why the flight to Baku was delayed, was heard on board as well as at the boarding gate in Baku Airport. We arrived at IST at 0:55 on DEC 31, 1hour 35min behind the scheduled arrival time. Although no guide for transferring was stationed, I passed through a checkpoint smoothly, as all Business Class passengers were taken quickly near there in a van. I got to the gate just after boarding. The departure time of TK52 was 1:55, so it was well before it. As I took a seat and was drinking a glass of water, the pilot announced a couple of times that he was waiting for connecting passengers to come. After 50-minute delay TK52 commenced taxing. Their in-flight services were far from customer-centered. Taittinger’s champagne is on their wine list. I asked a male FA called a flight chef whether it was well chilled or not. I added, “Taittinger should be served well chilled.” He replied “It is in the fridge, so no problem, sir” I believed him and ordered.  It was not chilled and was flat as well. That bottle must have been opened some hours ago. He would not show up before me from then on.  I asked a female FA for a glass of sparkling water. She asked me, “With ice and lemon?” I said, “Please.” Another FA got me a glass of sparkling water without ice and lemon. What an incoherent service they offered! On their menu almost no other option than a Turkish one, as far as I am concerned I have never found it delicious whenever I visit Turkey. European carriers offer some kinds of Japanese food in their flights bound for Japan. Why not TK? Two hours prior to landing, around 6 pm (Japan Standard Time), at the time of the other meal service called breakfast according to their menu, I asked a female FA for a glass of red Bordeaux. She replied surprisingly, “This is breakfast.” I said back to her without pause, “For some people it is breakfast, but for Japanese people now is the time for dinner.” She brought me one.

So passengers had to walk to the aft galley to ask for something to drink. You can feel the crew was annoyed because we interrupted their conversations. Sandwiches and small cakes provide for passengers as snacks during the flight were not offered to us. About 3 hours into the flight, the lavatory was very dirty and out of toilet paper because crew hardly checked it. So I had to search for a lavatory which was acceptable to use. So many call bells went unanswered, why if that particular passenger had a medical issue? During breakfast service, I was given a tray without asking my meal preference.

Clearly deteriorating Customer Relations over the last few years and a user unfriendly website for online reservations, check-ins and the like, with issues not evidently addressed after complaint, due to stress of uncertainties of whether things go through correctly or not. The Customer Relations reactions are only repeatedly to send out satisfaction surveys it seems, with no further action. Example, on a trip from Istanbul to Edinburgh last year, I was blocked in online bookings because I couldn't enter a 'visa number', despite being a UK citizen, with a valid passport, and Scotland not (yet?) having left either the EU or the UK. Since that trip, the user unfriendliness of an over complex website has been experienced on every subsequent trip I've made with Turkish Airlines. It seems that they have an identity and purpose problem that has grown over the last few years (I frequently, frustratingly, fly with them). They can't decide priorities: are they an airline, a shopping experience or a political party?

When my itinerary from Baku-LAX (17 hours in the air) was purchased, I bought seat selection for extra comfort, especially the long haul from IST-LAX and return. I had to make a slight change in the departure from Baku-IST by a few hours earlier. Because of this change on the initial segment of my flight, all seat selections for the entire itinerary were cancelled, a loss of over 200 euros. I chose to repurchase the seat selection again for a cost of 200 euro. After 2 formal requests to be refunded for the loss of 200 euros in cancelled seat selections, TK simply keeps referring me to the feedback form online and reminds me that I agreed to the changes before I confirmed that change in departure date. Had the vague message at the time of ticket change been made clear, something like ""your seat selections for ALL seats on this entire itinerary will be lost"" I would have never changed the departure date. However, the corporate response from TK continues to refer me to this feedback form which keeps sending me the same unsatisfactory response. TK prides itself on flying to more countries than any other, but who cares. The focus should be on improving the customer experience when dealing with people. TK staff have no decision making power and zero ability to change anything, even after talking to the ""highest level"" of customer service.

For the checkin seating issue, im not sure if its the airline's fault (about the online check in of course its the airline's fault) or just the worker in the check in desk in Istanbul airport is too lazy and too ignorant to help us locate our seat together, because our flight from Istanbul to Kayseri is similar, the person on the check in desk did not help us to be seated together, and we are seated separately (three of us), even that with my brother who is still underage.

The first thing annoying is the long queue at boarding gate. The gate staff check visa one by one at boarding, which is usually done by counter staff at check-in instead. The meal choice is the same as other regional flights, which means if you are unfortunately a transit passenger, you may have to eat the same thing on both flights. The cabin crew are impatient.

I thought she probably missed my answer in the noise cabin so I repeated my choice again. Surprisingly she looked at me with a very unpleasant face and inpatient tone saying ""yes yes I know"".

On the return leg when I reached Istanbul and went to the transfer desk, I was told to go through security and go to the transfer desk on the other side (what is even more pathetic that Turkish Airlines staff level of English is appalling or they just have no interest in learning/speaking it). I went to the transfer desk by my gate and was given a confirmed seat in business class. When the time came for boarding, I was told to sit aside because business class was ""full"" and I said to the gate agent, ""why did you give me a boarding pass for a confirmed seat?"" and he got annoyed at me then I said ""since you want to downgrade me, I am demanding my money back"" to which his reply was ""you contact Turkish Airlines for that"" and throughout the entire period he continued to be rude and condescending even though he knew I was a crew member. At one point he even threatened to close the gate if I didn't decide what I wanted to do. Long story short, I got thrown out of business class into economy and got treated like dirt. Having a codeshare/Zed ticket doesn't give any gate agent or rep to be rude or condescending because I am still a customer at the end of the day. Turkish Airlines needs to change their behavior and lose their arrogance. First off they need to learn how to speak English proficiently in today's travel industry. The last thing any customer wants is to struggle to understand someone behind a desk who doesn't speak English.

They refuse to apply them and do not follow ticket change/refund terms as advertised on their website. I had a flight booked with Turkish Airlines from Montreal to Sofia in second half of March 2020. I could not travel due to rapidly evolving pandemic situation, with new travel advisories and restriction imposed, and borders closed literally every 24 hours. At that time, Turkish Airlines had already cancelled virtually all European flights as of March 14 and had announced seemingly customer friendly compensation policies such as the Open Ticket and the Zero Change Fee. Back then, I called Turkish Airlines customer center, explained precisely my case, provided airline confirmation number and they told me my ticket was cancelled and I was eligible for free ticket change under their Zero Change Fee policy. Whenever I’d decide my new dates of travel, I should simply call them back for issuing my new ticket – that’s what they told me and this fact is well documented. Beginning of July I contacted them to request ticket change for a flight in August for the same destination and same cabin class as per the Zero Change Fee policy terms.

They would not take responsibility, I was given a bunch of ridiculous explanations and excuses, even got shameful demands to collect fare difference or cabin class ‘upgrade’ for more money, all of which contradicts the published terms of their Zero Change Fee policy. So, bottom line is that they do not adhere to the terms of announced policies, waste customers time and deride customers by asking them to contact third parties or their sales offices that may be closed, despite their website states clearly that all requests can be completed by calling the call center or online, as I was told back in March. Their call center and feedback form is a complete waste of time, they are not there to solve problems, but just to lead customers to a dead end – replies are but general wording and one can clearly see nobody in their customer care department is really following your case, aware of details or even reading what you wrote to them. Everything is done to deceive customers and to procrastinate the fulfilment of customer’s requests, ultimately ruining their travel plans. It is a disgrace for a Star Alliance member to treat its customer in such a way and my vow to Turkish Airlines would be that more actions are coming to denounce the disgusting way they mistreat clients.",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,1776,Solo Leisure,Montreal to Sofia via Instambul,March 2020,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I asked where to find wine but was told "" No alcohol because of Corona Virus"".  I appreciate the risk of multiple guests handling a bottle, but surely some miniature bottles could be offered? On boarding no pre-flight drink. A small water would have been welcome. In flight they served cold Refreshments. Individual bottles of wine were available but I had to ask for a plastic glass. Clearly they expected me to drink the wine straight from the bottle. They explained that no hot food because of the virus. I noted a tray of what looked like foil-covered hot entrees being taken to a rear galley. Presumably the crew are allowed hot food. The seats were in configuration 2-3-2 with big dividers at face level between each passenger. But the dividers were all folded away.

2020-08-26,"""experience as horrifying as this one""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Never in my worst nightmares did I think I’d have an experience as horrifying as this one. This was my first time traveling with Turkish Airlines and after the experience I’ve had I pray it was my last as well. I was travelling with my family of four (me, my husband, and my 2 kids). We couldn’t preselect the seats since the airline didn’t enable the online check-in which I’m assuming was to a measure taken to ensure social distancing on the flight. They placed us all separately, when I asked why they said it was because of the social distancing measures that we were placed rows apart next to strangers. Me and my husband were placed towards the front while my kids were seated right next to each other at the very back of the flight. My husband was placed one seat apart from whoever was next to him, however I was placed right next to some strangers with an empty seat next to the three of us - my kids were placed directly next to a stranger who turned out to be the mother of one who was also placed away from her kid. Soon we found out that most families were separated this way, which to me is pretty pointless.  I think if they were going to place people right next to each other they very well could’ve placed families AKA people of the same household next to each other instead. A few families were complaining about this prior to take off to which the crew responded very disrespectfully, (they went as far as name calling the passengers out loud) they kept on repeating this was ITA law, and they had to abide by it. They even called ground staff for one of the families. Thankfully the ground staff was way more reasonable and polite then the crew members. They shuffled a few people around including my kids very respectfully and without causing any more chaos. After the ground staff left one of the crew members returned to the family they primarily called the ground staff for and demanded they thank her because she “solved their problem” and proceeded to call the father an idiot once again. After witnessing all this my kids were terrified to move in fear of the crew disrespecting us in the same manner, despite the ground staff’s clearance. They were scared. Then came the flight from Istanbul to Manchester. This flight was fully booked there wasn’t a single seat that was empty. The cherry on top of this cake from hell was the food. Due to Covid-19 to reduce contact with staff they only served us once on both the 8hr and the 4hr flight with the same exact food. There were four items, a bottle of water, a juice box, a dry piece of cake, and a small size cheese and tomato baguette. The baguette was very dry as was the cake.

2020-09-01,"""cost-cutting on whatever they can""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Turkish Airlines (THY) used to have one of the best business class on short haul flights within Europe. Not anymore. At first, it might seem that certain elements of the older days' business class are unavailable due to some sanitary measures against the coronavirus. At least, this is what Turkish Airlines will try to make you believe in. Yet, on a closer look, you just realize that they are cost-cutting on whatever they can, even if their business class tickets cost as much as they did when it was good. What I find offensive as a customer is that deception of its customers is part of the economic model here.  They no longer serve you a proper warm meal in the business class and try to say that it is due to some anti-virus measures. But Lufthansa and many other airlines still do that with an additional measure of a transparent plastic cover on the top of your dining tray. If those airlines can, why cannot THY? The cold meal box that they provide (as an allegedly ""safer"" option) is so cheap that it just ""screams"" from within ""we are cost-cutting!"". For example, if hummus can be put there into that small covered round plastic bowl, why cannot they serve a proper dessert like say a chocolate mousse? And how is it more ""dangerous"" to serve a decent dessert in the same container in which they serve you their hummus anyway? Instead you get a Snickers bar as your dessert! Yes, a junk food in the business class! No more Champagne or French wines. Again, the board attendants will tell you this is because of the virus. Yet, the small bottles of a cheaper Turkish wines by Kavaklidere are still available (not for long may be). When you ask how is Kavaklidere wine brand ""safer"" than Louis Eschenauer wines or Piper-Heidsieck champagne that they used have you should not, of course, expect any satisfactory answer. Overall, both food and drink experience on board is just an impoverished version of what it used to be. They did not even have a Turkish ayran. The same is with the business lounge at the Istanbul airport. And given the examples I made, it is clear that these drastic downgrading in quality is far from being owned exclusively to precautions again the virus. Again, it is fine if an airline chooses a cost-cutting business model. But what is not fine is that they still sell you their ""business class"" for an old price which is nowadays a premium economy at best. So in the end, as a customer I feel tricked and deceived and realize that it is at the expense of customers like me that THY is trying to compensate for their losses by selling me the business class for an old price and then cost-cutting on my travel experience so that there is a larger net income from their new, downgraded ""business class"" ticket sales. And what is worse, is that they don't even seem to be interested in their customers opinion any more. There is no feedback for at their website!

Temperature in the cabin is below freezing. I am 57 and I have regularly flown across the pond since I was 12. Believe me this was the worst experience ever.

The only positives I will say are flight attendants and mostly on time experience. The rest was as bad as a discount airline. I flew 6 flights, roundtrip LAX to IST, IST to ASY, ASY to ADB (via IST), ADB to IST. Turkish is supposed to have great food service. Well, a 13 hour flight and we got two boxed lunches with cafeteria quality food. Limited beverages. No snacks. That was both ways on the long-haul. Tell me how covid doesn't live on a cold box, but it would on a warm wrapped sandwich? How does it not live on a box, but apparently a bag of chips or crackers or candy? When asked you could tell the flight attendants were embarrassed. On the short flights in Turkey in Business, you got a 4 oz cup of water. Apparently Covid doesn't live on water container, but does on soda or juice? Add to this that they brag about access to business lounge. Domestic and Intl closed at IST, so they pack you into regular club. No social distancing and Domestic lounge only had prepacked rolls and a cheese sandwich. Intl had hot food, but the lines were 15 to 20 persons deep. In Izmir, no lounge due to COVID, even though other Lounges open. In Kayseri, no lounge open and you had to carry your bags from check-in to a luggage belt with no assistance. And they don't allow any carry on bigger than backpack or shopping bag, even in Business on 13 hour flight. In LAX, they didn't open check-in until 2.5 hours before departure, even though the staff said 3 hours. And they were flying 787 from LAX but switched to old 777 with 2/3/2 configuration where either you get crawled over or you crawl over someone. And the seats are designed for multi directional recline, but they don't work. Wifi wouldn't connect on laptop, iPhone or Android. 3 flight attendants tried to help, but couldn't get it to work. Turkish sent an email apologizing and offered 25% discount on next flight if booked in 30 days/travel in 60. That's really helpful to someone living in the US! To blame COVID safety precautions for what is merely an attempt to save money is shameful, especially when they cram people together at check-in and in lounges. And to advertise the lounges, meals, etc. when booking business is nothing short of criminal. I've flown a dozen airlines over the water probably 50 or 60 roundtrips, and this is by far the worst.

The food options at the airport weren't great. Only Turkish food primarily and I am a huge fan of Turkey overall but with children, it wasn't great to not have easy options. The meals on both flights very scarce and extremely disappointing, with children, it was a very sad situation. We are already restricted in terms of the bags we can bring on board. This limits your ability to properly pack yourself for you and children for a long haul journey. Very disappointing. It was a dry sandwich given in a paper bag with a juice box and a dry piece of cake. I was shocked and the sad part was, we got the identical thing on both flights (a total of three times).

The crew are not allowed to let the pax change their seats because: “in case you got sick after this flight, they should know what was your seat” instead of just taking an actions on preventing their pax from getting sick by following social distance rules and common sense. The lady sitting next to me was obviously sick, sneezing and coughing all the time, moreover she was enormously overweight, so it was very inconvenient and not safe to sit there. Despite all this, I wasn’t allowed to change my seat while 5-6 rows at the back were empty. Which is totally unacceptable for the covid situation. My PCR test is done a day before this travel, and it’s negative.

Even after providing all the necessary information and talking to the supervisor on the phone the ground staff decided not to let me check in.

After a week or so, I decided to buy another ticket from a different airline, KLM. With exactly the same visa and other documentation I was able to take the flight back. After coming back I reached out to Turkish Airlines many, many times, but they have basically ignored all my arguments and documentation. They have just decided not to solve this issue at all.

My many contacts with their support system finally wore me down at the end. All four sectors of my flight has been cancelled one by one over the last few months, which I can accept due to the Covid situation. Problem is that every cancellation forced me into the arms of the call center. I have learned a few things from these interactions. Be prepared to press a lot of numbers on the phone before talking to a human. Very few of the agents seems able to make a decision without talking to a supervisor while you are waiting. If the answer you finally get from an agent seems strange/weird/stupid don’t give up. Call back, talk to another agent and ask the same question. In my experience there is a good chance you will get a different answer. There seem to be an arcane way of doing things in this company. At one point I had to pay a fee for a date change on one of my flights, but none of the agents were able to tell me how much the fee would be. I got guesses ranging all the way from 50 to 400 euros. “Someone for another department will call you, calculate the fee and arrange the payment”, I was told. So I waited for a day, two days and finally after five days, I called back asking about the fee. Again I was told “Somebody from another department will call you, calculate the fee and arrange payment”, I was told again. “When do you thing it will happen”, I asked. “Maybe one more week. I don’t know. But if you not hear anything, you should call back”, said the agent. So after another week I gave up.  And since I couldn’t cancel the ticket online, I had my last encounter with the call center. Here is a play by play: Me: Hello I want to cancel my ticket. Agent 1: I can’t do that for you. I will transfer you. Me: Hello I want to cancel my ticket. Agent 2: I can’t do that. You have to go to one of our offices. Me: The one nearest to my home (90 min away) have been closed due to Covid. The one in Copenhagen (4 hours away) is listed as “temporarily closed” on your homepage. Agent 2 (after a long pause): You can send them an email. Me: I did that 3 days ago. I haven’t received a reply. Agent 2: You can send them another one. Me: Listen, I just want to cancel the ticket. Agent 2.: Okay I will cancel it for you.

2020-12-19,"""Not worth your money""",3,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am Turkish and used THY services more than 10 times in the last 4 years. I believe you should be looking for another airline company if you are not obliged to use their services due to the following reasons: For international flights: THY is, as far as I concern only airline which has a direct flight from Los Angeles - LAX to Istanbul - IST airport. That was the main reason I have decided to use their services again, and I regret my decision not surprisingly. There are two different scenarios: Imagine, you are arranging a flight from LAX to IST, which has a domestic transfer from IST to Izmir Adnan Menderes - ADB airport. They leave only 55 minutes between 2 flights, where you should get into passport check and airport security. As if this wasn't enough, your LAX flight gets delayed 35 mins, and they only postpone your flight for only 5-10 minutes. The cream of the pie was, they assign the domestic transfer gate to the furthest possible one. When you arrive at the gate after having a small running competition and just as you are seeing that they are shutting the gate down, you are being told that it is too late now instead of not shutting down the gate. Then you are going to the ticket office, and they are saying that the next flight is like, 6 hours later. After you have been flown like 13+ hours, you are going to wait 6 more hours. Thanks, that is classy. I will need to buy food, internet and sit here for 6 hours. I have just come here to see my family after three years, and I have only a week here. So, your free ticket doesn't solve the issues, does it? Oh, the second one is even better. The very similar scenario above, but you are flying to Beograde - Tesla Airport (if I remember the name correctly) instead of having a domestic flight. Delays only 15 mins, but you had 45 mins between 2 flights.  For domestic flights: Well, this is a short one. You are arriving at the airport 70 mins before the flight and arriving at the counter 57-58 mins before the flight. You will walk only 5 mins to reach the gate after the counter. But they are telling you ""sir, you should've been here 60 mins before"". So, you buy another ticket from another airline. General: Food was a disaster.  Not only because of pandemic considerations but also managed poorly, and their attitude confirms their current position.  As common sense, If it takes 25 mins to walk to the transfer gate and if there are both passport and security check, then you don't assign 1 hour between flights. Easy.

The problems began at check-in, when they refused to check my bag through from AMS over to KLM (I flew Delta from AMS to ATL and then home to TPA). ""No problem,"" I thought, ""I will just go through passport control, grab my bag, and check in with KLM again.""  I chose my own seat, which was great. I prefer a window seat toward the front of the cabin. So everything was going to be great in 9A, flying on Christmas Day to Amsterdam, so it should be quiet and fairly decent for an Economy flight. Upon boarding, the gate agent took my boarding pass and reassigned me to 38A, the literal last row of seating on the plane. I am fuming at this point, as the front of Economy cabin is literally empty. Turkish passengers began complaining so much (this had also happened to them) that the gate agent came onto the plane and said she had to move us to the back to ""balance the plane"" .. this is the actual explanation that we got. Utterly absurd. Everyone who tried to move to a different seat during the flight was forced to return to their assigned seat, even though the plane was almost empty, and several people were forced to go back and sit with people with whom they were not traveling! Unreal! The cleanliness and hygiene was fine. We got a brown paper bag with a kashar cheese sandwich, a cake, a box of fruit juice, and a small bottle of water. Leg room was appalling, but not out of line with most Economy seats. But the fun had only just begun! Upon arrival in Amsterdam, I went to passport control so I could go to the baggage claim, collect my checked bag, and check-in with Delta (via KLM) .. except at passport control, I was told that I was not allowed to enter the EU because of COVID restrictions! So, I walked up to the transfer section, went through the security check, and then tried to find my gate and someone to help me. Because of THY's refusal to check my bag through to another airline, it was removed from the plane, slung onto the belt, and dumped. Without KLM's help, they would have abandoned my checked bag in AMS with no way for me to reclaim it! Thankfully, a KLM agent was extremely helpful, called Swissport with my THY bag claim ticket number, and got it loaded onto my Delta flight.

When I arrived at checkin, the guy checking me in couldn't find my ticket so I had to dig into my email for all the information about the ticket. He then proceeds to enter a wrong information and attached it to my baggage. Since it would take him some effort to fix this error, he decided I must suffer the consequence and pick up all 3 of my big luggages and carry it around in Turkey and check them in again for my next flight. At this point, I'm getting a sense of what flying with these people entails. In the plain, a brown paperbag of some cate, a cold sandwich and juice is tossed at us as a meal. Once I landed, I find out other passengers had flights to the destination I wanted to go and only mine and a few other people were moved to two days later - trying to change my ticket was double what I originally paid for by the way. Strange. Mind you, I need a covid test 48hrs before I enter Ghana, and the one I have with me will expire. This means I'll need another test in Istanbul before I'm allowed to board my flight. Next comes getting a visa at the Istanbul airport - (Cheap is not looking too cheap now). After learning all this, I decided to go with the flow, since there was nothing else to do. I go to their service desk for the hotel promised and I was told my flight doesn't qualify for a free hotel because I agreed to them changing my ticket. Mind you, I had no other option. Cancelling my ticket meant losing some amount. At this point I'm fuming. I just lugged my luggage out of the airport and paid for my own hotel. Coming back from Ghana is a whole other story. I'm at this point stuck in Istanbul airport having to take another airline to go through Doha and then the US.

They change flight times or dates owing to C-19, but once a flight changes, then it is near impossible to do anything online, and their call centres are not good at resolving issues. Their computer systems are either slow or not functioning, and they keep on telling you to go to a ticket office to resolve issues. The ticket offices are equally incompetent in what they do. I have probably spent 10 hours on the phone trying to resolve simple issues, and until the very last day several hours before our flight, these issues could not be resolved, including giving us the extra leg room seats that we paid for. Re. the flights being covid safe, i think the cabin crew should do a better job in ensuring mask wearing compliance, and social distancing when disembarking. Either they don't want to confront passangers owing to language barriers or they do not care, disembarkation and mask compliance during flights are both shambles. Last but not least, don't bother complaining about your issues, their complaint team responses are a joke, and they give the impression that they don't read what you wrote or worse don't care about actually resolving your complaint or making you feel like a valued customer.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,1831,Family Leisure,Istanbul to Madrid,December 2020,A321,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

We then decided to stay back due to Covid and contacted Turkish Airlines on 9th Jan 2021, with intention to postpone our flight. When we got a reply back from Turkish Airlines, they had by then re-scheduled the flight instead of having cancelled earlier. Anyhow, we still wrote in to postpone the flight. We provided the Booking Ref., which should already be sufficient for them to take action. Then we received another reply demanding that we provide, Booking Ref, Names, Original Flight No, Flight Date, Flight Time, E-Ticket No, which we furnished. That was on 11th Jan 2021. Till today, 23rd Jan 2021, we have still not received any reply nor instructions on how to proceed while the date of our flight is drawing closer. I agree with some of the comments here that Turkish Airlines service is one of the worst I have come across and they are ""robbing"" customers by not replying which will cause you to forfeit your flight. Then it becomes your fault. Even worse, we bought an Economy Flexi which allows us at least 1 change for free. We had to pay more for it. This is also not the first time TK has given us issues. They abandoned us while we were visiting Turkey at the height of the Covid 19 pandemic in March 2020. We called their office in Istanbul. Only to be told they cannot help us.

2021-03-05,"""avoid using Turkish Airlines ever again""",1,"Not Verified |  I'm doing all I can to avoid using Turkish Airlines ever again. The tickets costed about $800, but I ended up paying an extra $1,000 because of them. I was headed from LA to Montenegro via Istanbul. Once I landed in Istanbul, I saw my flight was cancelled to Montenegro. No email or phone notification - just on the boards upon arrival. They told me the next one would be the following morning - and when I asked why they said they don't know. But since it's COVID, so many people on my flight were going to have our tests expire if we had such a long layover - as most countries don't allow international layovers longer than 8 hours. So I had to pay for a sketchy VISA at the airport, go through customs, go get another COVID and wait for the results in the middle of the night. I got my results, went back to the terminal, waited another few hours and - guess what - they cancelled the rescheduled flight a couple hours before takeoff. Now my fellow passengers were furious, because they were giving no reason for the cancelled flights and just said they can cover our hotels. I asked when the next flight would be, and they said they don't know but probably tomorrow (turns out it was about 36 hours later - keep in mind most countries don't accept COVID tests older than 72 hours especially if you've had a layover). I then asked if there's any guarantee that the flight won't be cancelled a third time, and they said they don't know. So I got to the airport on friday, it was now nearing sunday, and I started work monday. I told them I might just have to drive, but to get me as close to Montenegro as possible. They put me on a cheap flight to Serbia, which was delayed by a couple of hours (one hour of which the passengers were sitting on a crowded bus outside of the terminal as they de-iced the plane). On top of this, passengers on both my LA-IST flight, and IST-Belgrade flight weren't wearing masks, and it didn't seem to bother the flight attendants. So I got to Serbia, had to get a hotel on my own dime, and another flight to Montenegro on my own dime. I'm of course going to dispute the original ticket cost since they screwed me over and just sent me to an airport that seems to profit off of cancelled flights by not offering complimentary internet (you have to pay a substantial fee every 12 hours), by forcing you to buy a visa in cash if you now need a new covid tests, and by offering pricy covid tests.

I was able to do it for my self but not for my wife. I decided to do it at the airport counter since there was no one to call on a Sunday night in Addis to help me. At the airport, the Turkish Airline local staff told me my wife's ticket has expired and they have no authority to help me or call Turkey. I was asked to pay extra 500 dollars to replace the ticket to fly. Once back in the U S I contacted Turkish using their feedback form.

I had marriage certificate, birth certificates for my kids, explaining that we are relocating... I seriously wonder what kind of information was provided that i was denied to enter. The day before we were in Embassy of Greece to get my consent for my husband to travel with kids. No issues. The ground staff didn't even inform me that i will not be flying, he just left for boarding. So ones again - we are relocating. My bank account is closed, mobile phone disconnected. I had to urgently book flight for me with Etihad and arrange transportation for my cat with less then 24 hours notice. I had to buy new cargo carrier because mine was already packed in container. My cat transportation with Etihad cost a kidney. When i picked the cat in cargo facility - she was in shock. I planned everything many month before to make my family relocation smooth and without stress, yet i end up being humiliated, left behind and forced to run like insane next day to arrange everything for Etihad flight including new PCR test. I got boarding pass for EY flight next day, no questions were asked. I contacted Turkish Airline for refund and compensation however their response was that they were acting according civil aviation rules and I was supposed to fly with family member. Obviously it was a mistake but airline would not admit it. ",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,1889,Family Leisure,Abu Dhabi to Thessaloniki via Istanbul,May 2021,,1,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

We were already 3-4 hours into the flight and they wanted to fly us back to LAX even though we were over Chicago. Later they told us the window by the pilots had a crack in it, so for safety we were going to emergency land and apparently this is a common issue with their planes. After everyone on the plane was asking to land in Chicago because we were flying over it, they instead landed and stranded us in JFK airport in New York. The crew was going to inform us what to do as the plane landed but never did. 300 people were stuck at JFK and we all had to go to one small terminal in an enclosed space and retrieve all our luggage. This happened around 5AM. It took almost 3 hours to get my family's luggage. Then we had to wait outside for another 3-4 hours to wait for small shuttles that can only fit about one family to take us to a hotel. We ended up booking at a nearby hotel and took an Uber, otherwise we would have to wait even longer in the cold. When my wife and I tried to contact the Turkish Airlines helpline and JFK they were extremely rude and closed the phone multiple times in our faces. We were stuck in New York for 18 hours. Finally, I was able to book a flight for 11pm after countless attempts of trying to get help. We ended up spending $600 in New York because Turkish Airlines refused to help us. $90 for the Uber to and from the hotel which was 10 minutes away. $400 for the hotel. Additional costs for food and another Uber ride ($90) to the airport and back to the hotel trying to get the airline to book us a new flight. We lost an entire day due to Turkish Airlines' negligence. They're extremely rude and don't communicate. Also, I had paid extra to have seats with more legroom. Once we got on the flight our seats weren't where they were supposed to be. We realized they changed the plane without informing us. I talked to a crew member and compared emails of our flight to show this was the case and they confirmed it. So, we lost more money there too. Just now I was trying to delay my return flight (back to LAX) for another week. I called Expedia and they could not help because of Turkish Airlines restrictions and told me to call them. So, I called Turkish Airlines 800 number and the man on the phone was very rude and dismissed any questions I had. He said I had to contact the JFK office to change my flight because when we were stuck in New York, we booked a new ticket (not sure how that’s connected).

However, apparently the company is guilty of overbooking, of which my son and I became a victim, and, as a result, our 15-hour flight lasted for three days. In Istanbul, the airline gave us an obscure background check on the reasons for entering Canada for my son, who has a valid student visa and study permit. Still in an atmosphere of terrible nervousness, because the check was carried out in the last minutes before going on the plane. In the end, we were allowed to board the plane, but by that time the exit was already closed, the landing was over, and the plane flew to Vancouver without us. There were about 10 people like us on this flight, some returned to Kiev, and some, like us, agreed to fly to Vancouver on the next flight every other day. The fact that all this was not accidental, namely with the aim of weeding out excess passengers, is evidenced by the fact that our luggage did not fly to Vancouver, but somehow also remained in Istanbul. And upon arrival in Canada, it turned out that the question that interested Turkish Airline so much was not at all relevant for the Canadian border guards, since they did not contain any comments regarding the grounds for entering the country. Since we had to wait two days in Istanbul for the next flight, there was a question about the hotel. The airline refused to put us in a hotel. Therefore, we had to pay for accommodation and food in Istanbul out of our own pocket. Although, the legislation in such cases stipulates that the airline must provide such passengers with accommodation and three meals a day and even communication. However, any attempts to prove something were threatened to deprive us of even those tickets for the next flight that we were promised. To top it all off, upon claiming luggage in Vancouver, it turned out that three of our four suitcases were destroyed, broken, torn apart, that is, beyond repair. The day after the flight, I filed a complaint about the suitcases on the airline's website, as well as a complaint demanding to reimburse the cost of the hotel and food in Istanbul, as well as to pay compensation prescribed by law.

They also don't provide notice when the domestic carrier makes scheduling changes. This years debacle involved Turkish Airlines booking a connecting flight on Alaska Airlines from our home town to LAX where we were to board the Turkish Airlines flight to Istanbul. This flight was so delayed we had to book a separate flight on another carrier and then pick up and transfer our bags once we reached LAX in order to catch the Istanbul flight.

I just said, give me another ticket back to Canada, they did after 10 hours. Thank God, my PCR test was still valid so I can travel back to Canada. Their customer service is the worst in the world.

When I asked them about my refund of the 40 dollars, they said I had to make a complaint online. Bad customer support, bad systems and a bad company.

After booking a ticket online which was booked as being changable though not refundable, and booking an extra empty seat, when trying to change my flight date i could no longer do it online because of the extra seat, which i booked ONLINE so no idea why they sell it if they cant then handle the rest of the customer journey. Then when i called customer service, the first person told me the system was down, the next 2 people told me there's nothing they could do and suggested i call the local sales office, while I'm in a country with no local sales office, where my flight origin has no email or telephone number for that sales office, and where the country I'm landing in has no published sales office. So there's absolutely no one for me to call. And then after messaging them on twitter, again absolutely no help, where they told me to call customer service, and then to call the local sales office again. My flight is Monday, all sales offices are closed on the weekend anyway even if i wanted to call, and now I'm forced to buy a new ticket or to exit the airport during my transit and try to deal with what will most likely be a sales office who are just as useless as everyone else has been so far.

2021-08-09,"""a refusal to issue a refund""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have used the airline multiple times without any major problems. The only issue that I had was that their website always had many bugs on it and occasionally I would need to resubmit the information several times before it actually works. But that didn't affect the flight experience. But this all changed recently. The airline has refused to give me the specific seats that I have paid for in advance. Not only that, but they have also refused to issue a refund on those seat purchases. Essentially, their customer services are no better than a low-coster. I bought tickets for Male - Istanbul flight and paid extra for specific seats (24J and 24K) to make sure I sit next to my girlfriend on that flight. And I specifically chose the seats with extra leg room, which are the most expensive seats in Economy class. However, despite the fact that I have paid in advance for the specific seats on that flight, we have been denied access to the seat 24K. That seat was allocated to someone else. Essentially, I have been denied the specific service I have paid for. Because we wanted to sit together, neither me nor my girlfriend got the seats we paid for. Instead, once the boarding has been completed, we have been moved to inferior seats in the middle of the cabin, as those were the only ones available. I have made three attempts to contact the company and get a refund. First time, they said they didn't wan to hear about my complain, because I need to do it through the online form and not by sending an email to them. Second time, they refused to deal with it, claiming that I haven't put some specific reference number in the text that wasn't even mentioned in the instruction. That was despite the fact that I have put enough information to make me easily identifiable as a passenger. Third time, when I have included every reference number I could find, I have received a refusal to issue a refund. It took me a while to understand what the reply actually said, as it used really awful English grammar, but they claimed that those substandard seats were equivalent to the ones I purchased. But they were not, as isle middle isle seats and window seats are very different and had different amount of leg room. Also, the customer representative has claimed that, even with the change, me and my girlfriend were still issued seats together. I don't know if they realise it, but having an isle between our seats is definitely NOT classed as seating together! I will still consider all the options for getting the refund. I've paid over £125 for those seats that I was refused to be given, so I will consider making a complaint to relevant authorities or even contacting my bank for a chargeback. And I will not tolerate such a behaviour from an airline that doesn't present itself as a low-cost.

Inside, there is a toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, lipstick (a good brand), eye patches for sleeping and hand cream. Their economy class bathrooms are just like first-class. They give pillows and blankets. They offer several newspapers in the entrance. The seats are very comfortable. The staff are friendly. The TV and shows are great and there are many movies. The food is plenty and delicious. They give you free food and water anytime you want. They always do this on long-haul flights (I flew recently). Regarding the short-haul flight (its been a while), they used to give food and amenities as well. I don't know whether it changed. British Airways sell food on short haul and they don't give amenity kits to short-haul passengers at all (I don't know about long-haul).

I don't have enough words to praise the cabin crew on the plane itself. They went out of their way to make the trip a really amazing experience. Nevertheless, the ground experience is by far the worse I've ever had with any airline in my life and I normally fly economy only. We were entitled 6 pieces of hand luggage of 8kg (a total of 48kg). Since we had a baby with us and an infant to take care of, we took 3 pieces of carry luggage of 8, 12 and 12kg (32kg) and no other personal items. The ground agent insisted that the 12 and 12kg be separated into one additional bag, which we didn't have with us. The baby started crying and the infant was restless, so fighting the kids and the ground crew of Turkish Airlines I had to remove the baby food from the carry on (around 2.5kg), baby blanket for the plane and some other items which were then tagged separately and we had to carry them through the airport like that. Also, they did not respect the seat reservations we had, since they say that they reserve the right to move people around the plane which ended up with us not sitting together for the final leg of the journey. Not something one would expect from a business class service since whoever has carried a baby through the airport knows what it comes down to running with two kids and a couple of loose items. (a picture of the tagged items attached) Previously I have flown with children on Lufthansa (where three of us had only one hand luggage weighing 11kg) and on Austrian, Aeromexico, LOT and we never had such issues although we always flew economy.

You might imagine how likely you are to get a full documentation while being abroad and in such a stressful moment. The flight availability was also not an issue. The airline had places on board of earlier flights but they were not flexible at all and denied any help, although it was not a cost for them. Overall, they seemed to be very bureaucratic, zero understanding of the circumstances, zero compassion. It was really very depressing experience, considering the situation I was in.

However, that didn't work for me either since they accept credit cards only. That detail albeit minimal left a very bad impression. Why even link the Wi-Fi to a certain membership/seat number instead of a device MAC address? The staff on the flight were trying their best.

Also Turkish Airlines is the worst ever compared to all the airlines I have traveled on.

The only word in English he spoke was ""closed"" although I there was still 60 minutes left. I asked and begged for someone who spoke English, but no one came and the employee just started talking to other passengers. The same employee directed me to the Turkish Airlines Services, where no one spoke acceptable English either. In the process, I got so anxious that I lost my ID card (which I found later). When my flight was gone, I was offered another one to Madrid (not my final destination) for 1000 euros. In order to go home, I had to pay 1600€ extra.

I could make a brand new reservation for the same exact same amount of miles as my old one plus 4,500 additional points for the infant seat. The call center could do the same. However, they couldn't change my old one. I asked them to cancel it - they couldn't do that either. They told me to do at the airport before my flight. When I left my home for the airport, the new ticket with an infant seat was still available. When I got to the airport, their system was down. The sales agent said my only option is to pay $450 for the infant seat because their system was down. He said I can write in after and get a refund. When I did, they refused my refund. All I needed to do was pay a $25 change fee or a $50 cancellation fee and pay 4,500 more miles. Their system was down, so I couldn't.

Obviously we missed our connecting flight, and the follow up experience resolving this was equally awful - their employees didn't seem to know where to tell us to go, just pointing in vague directions to walk, constantly pushing the problem off on one of their colleagues. I later witnessed their staff shouting at a lady who required a wheelchair be brought for her. It was shameful.

I am a Platinum Qantas FF and fly 1000s of miles every year. Long haul in business, short haul in economy. Check In - Awful. No Business Class signs, told to just ""push in front"" of a queue of at least 100 people trying to verify documents. Staff ignored requests for help and pretended not hear. Unorganised mess. Rude and aggressive ground staff, which defined the rest of the experience with staff. I was charged over weight of $250 euros. I reweighed what they claimed was 17kg in Manila, it was 10kg. It was a monitor that amazon had delivered ay 9.98kg. Same with my suitcase. If I had an option to walk away and get a refund I would have would have. I flew to Malta on Easyjet and they weighed the same bags and monitors at the weights I had got. I was not the only one being overcharged. MLA to IST - Awful. Lucky I took a few waters from the lounge. Offered a drink, never arrived. Cabin Crew spent whole flight hiding. Again they come across as rude and aggressive. The meal was beef fillet - burnt broccoli and a hamburger (that's what is looked and tasted like). One of the few positives the seats in the new 737 are good. 2 x 2 in business. Lounge Istanbul - Awful. Food was basically cakes. Not enough sitting space. Stocked up on water as expecting another painful leg. IST to MNL - Awful. Maybe I have been spoilt on Qatar A350. Maybe I was already annoyed but what a terrible product. Staff - I had to really bite my lip or I would have been incredibly rude. Just like they are. No menu, no drink offered, just super rude and aggressive staff. Ordering food was a challenge, ordering a drink impossible - would it not have been easier to get the menus, rather than describe the completely wrong products - ""some sort of beef thing"", it was lamb. Ordered a cabernet got a shiraz. Asked for water - nope. The seats -  I thought I was flying BA back 15 years ago. flat beds that go into a point so you can barely get your feet in. Super uncomfortable to sleep on, once offered to make my bed up, never came back. I was too scarred to ask due to the super aggressive rudeness of the staff. Everything was a chore. They huffed and puffed all the way through service. First meal (mezze) was goodish. Second was inedible, and I eat anything. Was never asked everything ok or shown any kind of care at all. I only flew Turkish as it was short lay over. I had flown them before the reverse route, side by side business seats where so much better. in flight chefs were great. I know there are restrictions currently but I flew Qatar not long ago SYD to MAN and what different experience.

I had to change my departure airport and while doing it they failed to change my arrival airport. I called them again to change both departure and arrival airport to IAH, Houston. To change it from JFK to IAH, they asked for a large amount of money ($3700 for route change) which did not make any sense. I decided to cancel my one leg of the flight and get a Qatar Airways flight. When I called them to cancel my return flight, they said it can not be canceled before the first leg of the flight is done. They advised requesting cancellation after the first leg of the flight is done. In that case, you will receive the full amount less the amount used for the first leg, the customer service person said. One thing to note about their customer service is this; they don't have a consistent answer for the same queries each time you call. Different people give different answers. It is a big hassle to talk to their customer service. They will flatly say no to your requests and they don't have a supervisor or a higher authority who can make a decision. They will tell you to email the local sales office. I asked to give the telephone number of the local sales office and her response was this "" Sorry, we don't have a local sales office in the US. You will have to email them. It may take 3 business days before you get a response."" After the first leg of the trip was over, I called customer service to cancel my return flight. They said our system is not updated that your first leg is completed. So give it 24 hours so our system can get updated and you can receive your refund. I called them after 24 hours of the first leg of the flight and the response varied. I called at least 10 times. Each time talked to different customer care personnel. The answer varied from your ticket is non-refundable (their person only said it is a flexible ticket and you can get a full refund after the first leg, and also it says on the ticket that it is refundable), the system not allowing me to process this, call back in 2 hours since our system is stuck. One person said you will receive $541 but when he tried to process it, he said the system is not letting him. Long story short, they managed to take a huge amount of money from me. The total ticket price was $2236. After completion of one leg, as per Turkish Airline customer service, I was supposed to get around ~800-900 US dollars. I have the names of each person I talked to and information received from them. But they kept a chunk of it and refunded only $160. And mind you, this is how they make money!

2022-01-03,"""I would recommend avoiding the airline""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is about the customer service at Turkish Airlines or the absence of quality customer service. This ticket was bought in the summer of 2021. In August I received a notification that the flight TK1333 from Istanbul to Bremen for 24 December has been canceled. In November I call the airline given it does not fly to Bremen that day to change my flight to Hanover and I rent a rental car to get to Bremen. My partner had the same issue, for him we called a few days before the actual flight to make the changes. Both times the customer service agent tells us the flight is canceled and tells us our options. We go for the free rebooking. On 24 December at the airport, we see at the departure screen that flight TK1333, presumably canceled is operating with 10 minutes delay. It was too late for us to switch. I took a picture of the departure screen. A few days later I email Turkish Airlines customer service highlighting the failure to provide good service, the failure to notify us when the flight got rescheduled or to tell us when we called twice (once for each traveller) that the flight had been rescheduled. This is not my first time dealing with their customer service through the terribly heavy feedback mailing system. The answers are typically unsatisfactory. Generic sentences saying the airline feels sorry (not: apologizes). In the first reply the flight cancellation issue was not addressed at all. The second time the answer was amazing for its uselessness - it showed how little a state-owned and-subsidized airline feels it has to be accountable to its paying customers. Here is what I received: 'We’ve reviewed your feedback forms TK-5751236 and TK-5721899 in our review, we found that the activities and evaluations we carried out following your feedback were in accordance with all rules and procedures. As such, unfortunately we’re unable to take your request any further.' I still do not know what happened, why the error happened, not do I have an apology or any commercial gesture to compensate. I have had a number of such bad experiences with Turkish Airlines customer service - usually it is impossible to get the agent to engage on the topic at hand. Errors are rarely admitted.

Since this was not my final destination, I needed to pay for 2 nights of accommodation until receiving my luggage. But the worst part is when I called 2 days before my departure flight for changing my return date. First I asked for a date 12 days from this point and I was told it is going to cost $40 USD. My original ticket costed me almost $700 USD for a return ticket. As I was not sure about the date, I asked if I can have an open return and then I was told you can make your ticket open and I asked if it is going to work like my current ticket and the cost for changing the date will be in similar range and I was told that making your ticket open return is not going to make additional cost compared to now when you want to set a date for your return. So I made it open return. I called 3 days after that and asked for price for changing to a date 16 days from this point and I was told it costs $960 USD. I checked their website and the ticket itself was only $980 USD. I told them you mean my current ticket worth only $20 USD! After making a complain following up for 5 days for my complain through phone, finally, I received a generic answer that according to our fare rules that is what you need to pay. I called this day again and asked again about the price difference, I was told you need to pay $978 USD for a return date change while the price ticket from their website was $932.Unbelievable, it costs more to change return date than buying a new ticket. I ended up canceling my ticket and going to buy my ticket from another airline. They wasted lots of my time for nothing. I will avoid flying with Turkish Airlines for my future flights.",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,2038,Solo Leisure,Houston to Shiraz via Istanbul,November 2021,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

I had called and emailed Turkish Airlines and their response was rude and seemed they don't want to do their job.  I have not gotten any reply from them.

2022-01-26,"""careful with the way you ticket with this airline""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Be careful with the way you ticket with this airline. Forbid you have a voucher for a reimbursement for future use or whatever reasons, they will not honor it or they will come up with any excuse to cut it in half. I just purchased tickets for my wife and I for travel in February to Istanbul and I had locked my reservations. My wife had an existing voucher and I was paying by Credit card. They have rules that no one knows and they want you to know about these rules after they issue you the voucher, that if you have a voucher you can only redeem that in a sales office in the USA or Turkey or local country of Origin. Try getting a sales office in the USA. There are none and all USA sales office numbers get routed to the call center that has difficulty understanding English. So if one has to redeem a voucher, you can only do that at a Turkish sales office in Turkey. I called the call center, after 20 call attempts since either they had computer errors, or computer was down or they dropped the call, I got an agent, telling me that if I need to ticket my ticket together with my wife, I have to go to the Sales office in USA and or Turkey not willing to understand there are no Sales offices in the USA that are manned unless you have lost baggage. Finally I found a friend, who went to the Istanbul office to book my tickets that were already locked with a price but they ended up charging me and extra $60 for my tickets of $920 (total $980) and $340 for my wifes tickets that had a voucher of $1000 and the tickets were $920. So her tickets actually cost me $1000 from the originally purchase I had made plus $340 extra. Total $1340. Remember I had already locked a price of $1940 for two tickets from the Turkish website and had a reservation code and Paid for the lock of the tickets. The reason for this hike was the new ticket is being booked in Turkey, and the Turkish lira is 14 to a lira and when I was given the voucher for $1000 of refund that Lira was 8liras so I have to pay the 6liras per $1 price difference for the devaluation of currency hence the extra cost is $340 on the new ticket plus the $1000 on the voucher. Where is the logic in this? What happens if there is no one in Turkey to go to the sales office locally? I guess can never use the Voucher. Where is the logic that If I paid US $1000 on a ticket in June 2021, they cancelled the flight due to COVID, they issued the voucher, now they converted that $1000 to exchange rate at that time and I have to pay out of pocket more money because the $1000 is now worth $500.",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,2044,Couple Leisure,Miami to Baghdad via Istanbul,October 2021,,,,Turkish Airlines,Turkey

2022-01-31,"""They refused the certificate of full vaccination""",1,"Not Verified | I write from your Business Class Lounge in Istanbul. Having arrived at the airport at 11 pm the night before to take the flight TK 0692 from Istanbul to Cairo the check-in staff member insisted that a PCR test was the only way we could take a flight to Egypt. They refused the certificate of full vaccination issued by the European Union and I quote this certificate was irrelevant. We were informed that the only way we could travel to Egypt was to take a PCR test at the airport and await the results My colleague and I have no choice to comply with this false demand to complete our journey. We took the PCR test at our own expense. We then had to wait for the results. We returned to the Business Class check in where we had to rebook our flight at 7.30 am six hours later. We were informed that my ticket was going to cost an additional €450 citing that the ticket had been changed 4 times already. This I might add was because Turkish airlines had already cancelled my flight from Malaga to Istanbul 4 times leaving us stranded at great expense. After further debilitating stress. We finally managed to re-book our tickets on the much later flight at 07.30 am. During the process, I had asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. No one was available to help, and the attitude of your agent was beyond rude. It was stressful and humiliating. I am of advanced years and the stress caused has had a very negative effect. During the debacle of your insistence on the now proven unnecessary PCR test, it was suggested that once we arrived at the so-called “Business Class Lounge” we should ask to speak to a manager. When we explained our situation the ridicule continued, and the reception staff after a minute on a mobile phone search reiterated that a Covid Certificated issued by the European and the Egyptian government was irrelevant and a covid PCR test was the only we could travel. This compounded the stress of the whole situation when again the risk of refusal to board might again be insisted upon. I cannot express the level of my feeling of stress and humiliation given by your staff's superior attitude. Apart from being worn out by your treatment, we are at the loss of the cost of the unnecessary PCR tests and the additional fee for rebooking.

Travelling out of Canada our connection after reaching Istanbul got delayed by approximately 8 hours. No email, App update, phone call or correspondence for this delay whatsoever. How we came to know about this is the flight update screen at the airport which we thought was glitching as expected time was showing as expected but had another value of time in front of it which was odd so hence we inquired at customer service.  Customer service was the most demeaning, inhumane and stressful experience. We couldn't even make it to the desk before an airline rep pulled us out asked our flight number and without any info about what's going on? what are our options? asked a question to us ""Food? Yes? No?"" I replied just want to understand our flight situation as nothing is updated or conveyed to us. He replied No food? Ok passport? I gave him the passport thinking ok some resolution finally but he took it went behind the desks, vanished there in the back in the kiosk and came back after 15 min. Asked me again, Food? I said  what's up with flight?. So again we got back in the line up so we could talk to a human maybe. Reached a lady finally, nicely asked about what's going on with flight and what are the options, accommodations. Lady said the flight that was at 9 is now in the morning (it took me good long time to get this info) she said no hotel we don't accommodate. Anyways back and forth she got agitated and threatened to call police which Ironically I should be calling as I was being robbed. I stepped back because if this was customer service imagine how police would be. Went to another line again now this time a gentleman, pretty straight forward told me he doesn't deal with that side of the business but can help me give options and the options was a substitute flight that will go to a different city and we need to figure out on our own from there. Which of course we took as I wanted to be out of there ASAP. Every single person in that line up, regardless of my flight or a different destination was extremely frustrated, crying or with hopeless face.

For unknown (according to Thailand Doctors) reason my father died on the plane and the plane made an emergency landing in Phuket Thailand. They sent my dead father and mother to the hospital by ambulance even though he was dead for a couple of hours. We received one phone call by the hostess to say they were being taken to hospital and confirming my father had died already even though Turkish airlines have in their reports that he died in hospital. I'm guessing to avoid any responsibility. For the next several hours, every family member including grandkids were calling Phuket hospitals trying to find my mother. Imagine your 72 year old mother who has severe asthma, Crohn's disease and has had triple heart by-pass surgery stuck in a foreign country with high humidity with limited English. No thanks to Turkish airlines we tracked down my parents to a hospital ourselves. We are grateful for the Thai people whom were very nice to my mother. They police took her to the hotel across the road which was kind of them. However, my mother who had just lost her husband of nearly 55 years, in complete numbness and shock had to stay 3 nights in Thailand until a negative Covid test came back. That was the earliest I was able to get my mother out of there. Costs - Hotel & food about $300, Covid test $200, Compulsory Insurance during the brief stay $300. Now comes to my father, I received an invoice to the amount around $5,760 which around $2,500 was to go to Turkish Airlines fees to repatriate my father back to Turkey. We asked Turkish airlines to take some responsibility and at least waive their fees. They said no. So family members chipped in and paid the total bill. And even though Turkish airlines is profiting by $2,500, they have not apologised and accepted any responsibility in the way my mother was dumped and treated, not to mention keeping family members in the dark.

I'm a Star Alliance Gold member and therefore - according to Turkish Airlines - allowed priority boarding. I was denied by the gate agent. I queried this with the supervisor, who insisted that this privilege was not offered. The flight was fine - reasonably new plane, service was good, and the meal was decent. A better job of cleaning was needed: I found two used masks in the seat pocket. Flight got bumpy as we neared Istanbul - we ended up circling for nearly 40 minutes, but there was never an explanation from the flight deck as to what was going on; it was a bit disconcerting following our progress but not knowing why we were not landing.

2022-04-20,"""do not help their customers""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was denied flight back to Canada from Istanbul. I was stranded in the airport with no one helping me. I had to wait for the next flight which was 2 days later. This caused me extreme anxiety, stress and unnecessary extra costs to my trip. I believe Turkish Airlines should compensate me for time, money loss and for pain & suffering. They have very poor customer service online and on the phone. As well their customer service agents in the airport are very rude, and abrupt. They made derogatory comments to me in Turkish the customer service agents definitely do not help their customers. I made a complaint to the company and I’m still waiting for a response. Upon my arrival in Istanbul airport on Monday February 14th I immediately called Turkish Airlines for reservation for my cat. I was told (though the representative asked me of the breed and the size of my pet I provided) that the cabin had reached its capacity limit and that the only option I had was to put my cat in the holding cargo. The representative even told me that I must have a hard carrier for my cat since she’s going to be put in the cargo. She then reserved a spot for my cat and told me that I’d receive an email confirmation for the requests. I received two emails. First email was for the cabin and it was not confirmed due to full capacity but second email was confirmed for cargo. The representative did not tell me that my cat was not allowed in the cargo and went ahead with the reservation. Based on the confirmation I received from Turkish Airlines I proceeded with my flight as usual on February 16th. I was held for the entire duration of the check out at Turkish airport with many different excuses from several different agents and scenarios and no clear explanation why I couldn’t fly at that time. The first reason was that my cat couldn’t be in the cargo area because there was a large dog and then the other reason was that I didn’t have sufficient documents and then they said that Because of my cat’s breed (exotic shorthair) I hadn’t reserved for my cat far in advance. I was extremely stressed out and the frustration was unbearable and above all my cat was in a lot of distress and hunger and thirst and no where litter box for her toilet. The Turkish Airlines staff were extremely unprofessional, unhelpful, and rude with me. They all refused to provide me with their name.  I experienced the worst customer service from a big company that I once thought they were a decent airline to fly with. This whole issue started all internally within the airline and no one wanted to help out. I was told by customer relations to wait in the airport until management team calls me to provide me with hotel, transportation, and my next flight for free of charge because this was the airline error and not mine. I was in the airport all day and night and no one called me.

2022-04-21,"""the worst travel experience ever""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been the worst travel experience ever. It started with the call center confirming our seats the day before travel from the first section of the plane to the end of plane upon check in. We were told boarding was delayed for hours until they finally canceled the flight Los Angeles to Istanbul. We were told to go to the ticket counter for assistance. Needless to say herds of us headed that way only to encounter chaos. No one from Turkish airlines had a contingency plan or a way to establish order. The flight that was checking in was stopped as all employees vanished for a long time. The call center was of no help since they just said the flight is delayed when i am looking at the ticket counter and see the flight canceled info. We were told by an employee to form a line in one stop to be changed to another spot 20 minutes later. Then to be told to go collect baggage and return in order to be attended. Meanwhile there were other travelers who stayed and demanded help which they received (they were traveling to Tel Aviv). My husband and I went to collect baggage and came back to ticket counter. With the same story of form a line here and then there and then moving it yet again, all the meanwhile this group was being assisted the whole time while no one else had this treatment. We finally got tickets for the next flight to Istanbul. We were separated by half a plane for the 13 hour flight. While getting settled in I noticed the same group of people being very demanding to the flight attendants causing them to be unavailable for other passengers due to all their demands. The most turbulence ever on a flight. Upon arrival to Istanbul we encounter 2 flights held awaiting passengers from our flight however ours was not held (which was scheduled to leave even later than the Tel Aviv flight and Barcelona) Our connecting flight was for Belgrade. We were given the biggest runaround through the airport to try and get assistance for next flight to Belgrade and hotel accommodations. After hours we arrive at a hotel in downtown area where now it was midnight and nothing was open. Stranded without food, toiletries and clean clothes. We were picked up 3.5  hours later and dropped off at the airport. No one could help me from Turkish airlines in the Turkish airport!  Arriving to Serbia I called the call center from Serbia to be told my ticket numbers have changed and that is why can’t access my flights on the app or website any longer. Even with the new numbers still have the same problem. I could not select return flight seats over the phone or online. I was told i had to go to the main office in Belgrade. My husband is 6’6” and needs extra leg room. Not an option. I sent emails to complain about situation and try to receive help to only be told “we are sorry for inconveniences”. Needless to say I am in Belgrade to try and receive help at their office. Worse service ever! “Due to covid” no one in office can do anything other than ticket purchases. I am dreading the flights back home. I will encourage any and all people thinking about traveling with Turkish airlines to reconsider. It might be more money up front but it will be better in the long run. This has been a cloud over our whole trip.

Unfortunately every time I book a ticket there is either a problem with the ticketing, or service or luggage. This time, I tried to rebook our family trip with the tickets we did not use from Xmas. Since we have a baby under 2 and she needs her own seat, we can not book online. The system does not allow this. So we have to call the customer service. I had to call them 23 times (no joke) because a couple of times their system crashed after waiting 10-30 mins on the phone. Other times because the system is so slow, it took me 40 minutes to get an answer. And at the end nobody could explain to me why there was such a huge difference in the ticket prices that I have to pay on top. They were giving me the break down of the price: how much I pay for taxes, base fare etc.. and it did not add up to the difference and they could not explain why. I wrote a feedback to ask for it, after 5 emails, there was still no answer. Now despite this ridiculousness, I still continue my booking because I do not want to lose the original tickets. And now I have talked to 6 different call center agents who are telling me I cannot fly because I am requesting a seat for my 1 year old.

Instead of helping me, they started questioning me on why I did not take another flight from Kuwait to Istanbul. The lady at customer service refused to listen and was referring to mail sent few weeks back - which mentioned about 5 minutes change in schedule. I tried to reason that situation was due to delayed flight that no one would know 3 weeks ahead, but she refused to listen. Another representative questioned me on why I did not take other flight from Kuwait - even after explaining that it was Turkish ticket and we took 1st flight that was offered.

We were given numerous boarding times until we were told hours later that the flight was canceled due to a mechanical issue. We returned to the ticket counters to rebook.

The chaos/disorganization among the way the whole ordeal was handled was SO unprofessional . Passengers were instructed several times to move to different lines causing people to lose their places in line; causing more frustration. Since the flight did not show up online or on the app as canceled but rather delayed, we were not able to rebook on our own, even though we had been told it was canceled. The next step we were told to follow was to leave our places in line and go to the baggage claim and bring our luggage back to the check-in counter. The explanation for this was that when we get rebooked, the staff would be able to quickly tag our luggage. Once again, the lines were jumbled and people were angry. The passengers that were in the front of the line lost their places, and many were now in the back. Two areas were made for passengers wanting to cancel their flight and ones who wanted to rebook. We stood for hours.  People who ordered business class felt entitled to cut the line and did so with impunity. We returned the following morning at 7am and no attendants showed up for an hour. Next flight was to depart at 1:45 PM. Crew finally showed up at 2:25 PM. At 2:45 PM a bus to took us to the aircraft, and at long last, at 3:34 PM the plane started moving. At 3:43 PM the crew informed the passengers that we were returning to the gate due to Mechanical Issues. By 5:10 PM, back in the terminal, two staff members were at least being polite and helpful, they were the manager, nd another individual named. They succeeded in getting me on a flight that evening that left at 7:27 PM.

The seats are very comfortable and slightly narrower than the B777-300, however, there is plenty of leg room. I was able lie down fully flat. Dining is par excellence. The seafood appetizer (salmon, shrimp and tuna) with a garden salad was amazing. For the entree, salmon w/spinach watercress and mousseline chateau potatoes in pesto sauce was superb. For dessert, mango nougat mousse and chai. As with the service on B777-300, an onboard chef took our orders. Service from the cabin crew was exemplary. The inflight entertainment options were very good with live news channels, music, movie and tv show channels. WiFi was excellent. All you had to do is log into Turk Telecom with your last name and seat number on the boarding pass and you're connected.

The service was excellent with a personal chef taking dinner orders. This was followed by a beverage service (juices/lemonade) and warm mixed nuts prior to pushback. Hot towel service provided before dinner with a table cloth laid out on the tray. Dinner consisted of smoked salmon courgette, steak and arugula salad and fresh fruit. After dinner, an amenity kit was provided with a turndown service (individually packaged comforters) converting seats into a fully lie flat bed. I was able to turn to the side and sleep comfortably. The remote worked flawlessly. The TV screen is a large 17"" display. The Denon headsets provided good noise cancellation and sound.

While money was taken in 2 lots, it is coming back in more than 50 separate transactions, very confusing, some transactions are £3 others over £400. Very bad service.

I entered all the relevant info and managed to check in all my party, myself, my wife, my younger son 13 who has Downs Syndrome and was marked for special assistance, my elder son 17 and his friend, also 17 years old. I received the relevant confirmation in an email stating clearly that my party of 5 were all checked in and were allocated seats A to E in row 23, flight TK4330. I went to print off the boarding passes and was only able to print off mine and my elder sons but on clicking the other members of my group a message was displayed stating that boarding passes were unavailable right now but they would be available to collect at the Turkish Airlines check in desk. I tried from my laptop, my ipad using the Turkish Airlines App and my son's friends android phone again using the app. Each time I was prompted with the same message stating that each of the 3 other boarding passes would be available at the check in counter. As an IT Systems professional, this did not trigger any alarm bells, no error message was displayed and the message was very concise and clear. I also had the email confirmation. The following day when I arrived at the check in counter I was told abruptly that only myself and my elder son could board the flight and the other 3 members of my party, my wife, my sons friend and my 13 year old would have to go to the sales desk to purchase new tickets for the flight the following day. As a seasoned traveller this was the most difficult situation I had ever encountered. I politely told the Turkish Airline staff at the desk that there was no chance of that happening. I explained to them very concisely what had happened and they still very unhelpful. I showed them the email confirmation and pointed out where it clearly stated that each passenger was check in and allocated a seat. They still weren't having any of it even though I pointed out that we had special assistance for my child who was now becoming very uncomfortable and visibly upset. I told them there was no way I was going to leave my wife, child and my sons friend and asked to speak to their supervisor. It was at this point they made a few phone calls and magically found 3 seats on the packed plane. On printing the boarding passes and handing them over the staff were visibly shamed and would not make any eye contact. We later learnt that Turkish Airlines had sold our missing 3 tickets to UK travellers (at a very handsome profit) who had missed their Gatwick flight. Does it get any more disgraceful than this.

TK should be ashamed for forcing their customers to take a bus when the aircraft is sitting 10 feet away from an air bridge.

One thing to note, both their website and app was absolutely useless for online check-in. On both flights, they did not note down my request for a child's meal and both times we couldn't complete online check-in, which resulted in us waiting in long queues to receive our boarding passes at the airports at YOW and KUL. Both outbound and inbound flights from Canada and Turkey were relatively full, which was expected with borders opening up all around the world. Our flight from YYZ to IST was delayed twice at the 11th hour due to the incoming flight from IST coming in late and this was not communicated clearly by the ground the staff as passengers had queued up twice, before being told of the delays. Our flights out of IST and KUL were both on-time, with boarding completed quite swiftly. Once we boarded the plane, this is where I find TK excels, both the B773 and A359 had really comfortable seats, new IFE systems, pretty delicious food, and very friendly and attentive crew, as they made sure my toddler was as comfortable as she can be for the flights. We were well fed, the seats were super comfortable and a whole assortment of videos and games were available to keep us entertained during our flights. Not too many airlines hand out menus, provide stainless steel cutlery, or an amenity kit in Economy anymore, but these guys still do! I would also recommend TK to traveling families as they were very attentive and approachable to me and my toddler, with any of our requests. On one of the flights, one of the stewards even assisted with carrying out our luggage to the door, as he noticed I was occupied with my toddler and had multiple carry-on luggage on myself. Only slight comment, was their lavatory garbages needed to be emptied more frequently and they sometimes didn't have enough milk boxes or certain type of meals for the passengers. The TK ground staff is where I feel they need to improve the most, if they want to compete with the likes of QR or EK. Both at IST and KUL their staff was nowhere to be seen after security screening as they made no announcements for priority boarding for traveling families and disabled passengers and announcements were never made to inform passengers that the planes were ready for boarding either. The TK ground staff at KUL showed no urgency to manage the long queues of people who were unable to complete online check-in and also did not seem interested in processing these passengers as quickly as possible. Ground staff for our IST-YUL flight was so clueless and unhelpful that passengers started arguing at the gate with them, as they were not managing priority boarding to families and disabled passengers correctly, which should be a normal process for full service airlines.

I waited 3 hours at the airport that the Turkish office opened for the next fly and I explained the whole situation to the receptionist on shift who immediately understood the situation. As he was reading the same guidelines on the system, which didn’t match the Qatar government website, he immediately sent a message to the DOP in Doha to get confirmation about whether the “pre-registration” was compulsory for EU citizens.

They will throw you under the bus and leave you to deal with the hassles yourself. I used to think they are good but ever since the pandemic hit. They started slacking.

You can imagine this was very uncomfortable for my head. Turkish response: we'll give you a little miles but only for our miles program versus your United program. After a lot of back and forth I accepted but haven't gotten the miles as their apps and site are broken and it's impossible to open an account with them. Trip home, IST-LAX, luggage broken.

The two men present at the gate for my flight from Istanbul to Dubai (TK758 on the 26 of June) were extremely rude, and they loudly told me and another customer to “Shush”.

Finally, after talking with rude Turkish Airlines representatives, we fixed the date for the 7th of July, from Detroit to Tabriz. (It was three connective flights). On the 7th of July, we were so happy that everything was fine and finally we were leaving the country for our wedding. I and my husband went to the airport and noticed that the flight that Turkish Airlines gave us was fake and there isn't any flight with that number in the airport system! Everybody at the airport desperately looking for the flight and all the people at the counter and even the airport police were shocked when they checked our tickets. We arrived at 5.30pm at the airport, we called Turkish Airlines customer service from 6 pm to 2 am! You can't imagine what happens, we talked probably with 15 agents, and 4 of them hung up the call, others were yelling at us and were so rude that this is not our fault and we can't fix it. Let's make the story short, all of the representatives said that there isn't any flight on the 20th July from any city in America to Iran. Representatives said to pay $4000 each to give us business class for the next day or we refund your ticket! We spent $50,000 on our wedding, guests were invited and we planned everything, but all of our plans were ruined by their big mistake! I got an anxiety attack at the airport and the police gave me water and asked me to be calm and relax! I call my family in Iran to say to cancel the wedding and they were shocked too. My brother lives in Turkey and he urgently rushed to the Turkish Airlines office in Istanbul, he said you must use their established yelling system so that somebody helps you, otherwise, they don't help with talking and they don't even say sorry for their big mess. Although they said we don't have an available ticket by the 20th of July, my brother bought a ticket for the 11th of July (with the same yelling method that Turkish Airlines representatives taught us).

The route was from Kansas City to NY (JFK) to Istanbul to Kathmandu. The coming back route was the same except it was Newark, New Jersey instead NY. The total travel time was between 35 to 40 hours each way. During the check-in, the agent was not able to accommodate my seating together with my parents for our flight from Istanbul to Kathmandu. This was my 1st disappointment as the flight was 11 hours long. My mother and I sat together and my dad sat separately. I was constantly walking around during the flight to make sure my dad was doing okay as I was concerned about his health. I am a petite size lady with a small body frame. For my size, the seat was very small and uncomfortable for long flights (8 and 11 hour flights).  The food served to me was horrible both ways. During my return flight, I had even bigger issue! As I was returning back alone from Kathmandu, Nepal to Kansas City, USA, I requested the travel agent that I would like to be seated in an aisle seat. To my surprise, I was asked to pay thousands of Nepalese rupees for an aisle seat. Keep in mind that I paid $2180 for this ticket. With the help from family I was assigned to an aisle seat at the check-in counter at Kathmandu. There is no snack served in between meals, even in 11 hours fight.

I reached IST and when I reached the boarding gate of my Mexico flight, I was denied boarding by the Turkish Airlines staff citing that the Schengen Visa must be used before to travel to a Schengen country before flying to Mexico. This self made logic of theirs is ridiculous because firstly - 1) Mexico govt simply mentions that any type of multi entry Schengen Visa is accepted. 2) A Visa is not an obligation to travel, if I got a Schengen Visa that does not bound me to travel to Europe. 3) Also, I know a couple of my friends who also flew to Mexico on their unused Schengen Visa with other Airlines and they were allowed entry to Mexico without any hassles at the Mexico airport immigration. After I was denied boarding at Istanbul (IST) airport gate, I was made to run behind counter after counter but no one in the Turkish Airlines staff actually knew how to handle this situation and they demonstrated an utmost level of hostility and lack of empathy.

After the boarding queues had reduced we approached the desk to board only to be very abruptly told the gate was now closed and we must stand aside. The gate staff then proceeded to process standby passengers and allow them to continue to board the plane. We stood directly at the counter next to them and watched with disbelief as the gate staff re-assigned our seats to standby passengers and allowed them to continue to board. No-one even bothered to look at our boarding passes or acknowledge any of our requests for help or offer any explanations. We were just shouted at repeatedly that the gate is closed (and I do mean shouted at). We were told to leave the area and go to a service desk which proved to be a roulette wheel of disappointment & frustration resulting in TK saying there was no availability and we must wait at least 72 hours to continue our journey and simply ignored our request for any hotel recommendations or even entry visa assistance for Türkiye (we were in transit). After much back & forth and coaching the ‘help’ staff in searching for alternative routes we managed to find a flight to AMS later that same day. Incredibly, TK then made us pay for a ‘new’ ticket rather than reroute our existing one. And the final cherry on the customer service cake was then being informed that when we arrive in Amsterdam we must find another airline and source and pay for the final flight to Norway ourselves as TK could not help with that route (special thanks to KLM who were very understanding and helpful). In summary it cost us an additional $4000 USD to reach our end destination despite holding valid tickets & boarding passes for all our original TK itinerary. We are all still dumb-founded at how rude and indifferent the TK ground staff acted and treated their customers. This was the first time we decided to fly with Turkish Airlines and it is most certainly the last solely because of the ground staff service at IST which was truly disappointing in every way.

The Milan flight did not wait for me and because the Trabzon-Istanbul flight was late, I missed my connection to Milan. This was on Wednesday August 3 in the late evening. I was flying business class to Milan, so I went to the business class lounge to check what happened. They gave me no compensation, and were only willing to book me a future flight (only economy class seats available). They were unwilling to help arrange accommodation that evening, even though this situation was the fault of Turkish Airlines.

2022-08-15,"""didn't know I'd even be on the flight""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Qantas from Sydney to Singapore, then Turkish Airlines from Singapore to Istanbul, and from Istanbul to Tel Aviv. On the way from Singapore to Tel Aviv, the flight was fine. The staff were rude, but the in-flight entertainment and the food were really good. On the way back though - it was a disaster from start to finish. First, we arrived at Ben Gurion Airport to check-in. I was travelling in a group booking with 20 other students. The Turkish Airlines staff member checked in 11 of us, and then said ""sorry the flight from Istanbul to Sydney is full, the rest of you are on standby.' We were travelling on a study program and couldn't be separated, but they didn't care. Apparently the flight had been overbooked by about 15-20 people. We were all still able to get from Tel Aviv to Istanbul without any issues. We were delayed by two hours in Tel Aviv because a Turkish Airlines staff member locked themselves outside at our gate. They had to wait for someone to let them inside. The person who came to let them in locked themselves outside. So, now we had two Turkish Airlines staff members locked outside. About two hours later, they were both let back inside and we could finally get on board to Istanbul.  In Istanbul, 7 of the 9 remaining students were able to get on a flight - including myself. I didn't know I'd even be on the flight until 5 minutes before the plane started to take off. It was actually me that was meant to be on standby, but one of the other students volunteered as a tribute in my place. They forgot to give me my luggage receipt (which I didn't even think to check until boarding). This made my lost luggage extremely difficult to track once I arrived back in Australia. Thankfully I did manage to get my luggage back after a 8 hours on hold and 11 days of waiting.

2022-08-16,"""always ensure you check in online""",7,"✅ Trip Verified |  I usually always love flying with Turkish Airlines but my latest experience left me disappointed. I was travelling on a codeshare ticket with Malaysian Airlines. This meant I was unable to do online check in before arriving at the airport. I received an unusual text from Turkish Airlines about 20hours prior to departure if I would like to give my seat up and get a refund to go to the Denied boarding office at Istanbul airport. No phone number or any way to discuss this offer further. I checked in at the airport 3 hours prior to departure and was told there are no seats for me. Flight is overbooked and to go to the gate and wait there. I feel this situation should be handled more carefully by the ground staff. I appreciate flights get overbooked but they need to explain this arrangement better. The agent clearly didn’t want to go over how it works, just that if I don’t get on the flight I’ll be looked after with accommodation and booked on another available flight. At the gate the ground staff again were not so helpful and just told a few of us to wait to one side once all passengers boarded (around 6 of us were in the same situation and all on codeshare flights!). They accepted us on the flight and explained some connecting passengers landed too late to make it to the gate in time. They need to improve their handling of overbooked flights as I am sure this is happening a lot and it causes a lot of stress for full paying passengers who expect more from a world class airline such a Turkish Airlines.

2022-08-24,"""only 2 seats were extra leg room""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  In January 2022 I booked on Turkish Airlines website 3 tickets for my family to fly from Bucharest (Romania) to Los Angeles with layover in Istanbul. The first flight was code-sharing (operated by Tarom airlines) while the second was Turkish Airlines. In April 2022 I received an email from Turkish Airline stating one of the flights has a new departure time (not important, 10 minutes time difference). I entered Turkish Airlines website to accept the change however it was not possible, the error message stated I should contact customer service to accept the change. I called customer service and told them I accept the change, the person I talked to said it is OK, he accepted the change for me. The next day I checked the reservation status on Turkish Airlines website and I noticed that for the 3 passengers I can see only 2 e-ticket numbers (the 3rd one was gone). I called customer service and after commenting that “your flight is in 4 months from now”, they said there is an error in the system and they submitted an internal ticket, it will be fixed in 1-2 weeks. I waited 1 week, no change so I called them several times over the following 2 months and also wrote emails to customer service. Finally on June 10 they wrote back to me saying: “We have checked our system logs and detected that there was a systematical error regarding the reissue of your ticket.” As solution the moved the 3rd passenger to a new booking (2 passengers on 1 booking code and the 3rd on a different booking code). I said than you and asked them to assign also the extra legroom seat I paid for to the new tickets. They confirmed they did. One day before the flight I tried to do the online check in. “Ticketing error” was the message, so I called customer service again. They confirmed in their system all looks good, no problem, I should not worry, I can check in at the airport. On the day of flight, we arrived early at the airport in Bucharest and spent 1 hour with the check in supervisor in Tarom because she was not able to check us in for the flight as the tickets were messed up. In the end (30 min before take-off) she managed to check us in for the flight to Istanbul and said we should get the next boarding pass in Istanbul airport. We ran through the airport and managed to board the flight. In Istanbul at Transfer Desk they gave us the boarding passes for the Los Angeles flight. I said I want to make a formal complaint, however the lady at the transfer desk was not sympathetic at all, she did not care at all, she said I have to call/ write customer service for that. We boarded the flight from Istanbul to Los Angeles, looked for our seats and discovered that only 2 seats were extra leg room (and we paid months in advance for 3 seats extra legroom).

The final leg of the return flight was via a Gulf Air codeshare. Turkish Airlines representatives on the aircraft were courteous. The aircraft seemed clean and generally well-kept. My luggage made it to its destination. It was not damaged. Their website made it relatively easy to select seats on the non-codeshare legs of my journey, and to do the initial check in process. Turkish Airlines does not administratively handle codeshares well. There is no online process on either airline to select a seat or upgrade the codeshare leg. The boarding passes are not valid on the codeshare flight and have to be reprinted at the gate. Gulf Air basically rechecked me in and re-reviewed my passport, visa, etc. At least my luggage checked through. Our flight returning to Bahrain departed the airport (Naples) a little over 30 minutes late for no reason that seemed apparent. Granted, Naples is a dumpster fire of an airport, and this did not help, but no one explained to us what was going on or why it was late. We still made it to the aircraft 10 minutes before take-off. There was no effort to get us back on time. There was no sense of urgency. No one explained to us what was going on. The overheads were stuffed completely full before even 50% of the passengers boarded. The crew started playing 'Tetris"" with the overheads to make stuff fit. This caused another 20-minute delay in Istanbul as someone's laptop was missing. It ended up at the opposite end of the aircraft. So now we are 50 minutes late, for no good reason, for a 1+40 connector at Istanbul. The crew in the cabin seemed unsure about what gate we were pulling into at Istanbul. For a codeshare flight international connector, it was impossible to pick two gates farther apart. Deplaned at terminal F, boarded terminal A. GPS tells me I walked (ran, actually) 1.6 miles gate to gate. If you keep people informed, they are less stressed.  Make every effort to be on time. This should be priority 2, right after safety. Enforce carry-on rules and manage the overheads. This costs time for no good reason. Clean up your codeshare process. I will now avoid codeshares with GCC and Turkish Airlines.

I had received a link from Copa Airlines as well to fill in health related details, and other questions on destination, citizenship, residency, etc. After filling all that, the website had clearly said ""no transit visa required"" for Panama. Next morning when I reached Istanbul airport, they gave me only the boarding pass for first flight. When I asked them for the 2nd one, they said I'll get that from Copa in Panama. They had also put my luggage until Panama, which I had asked them clearly if that could cause any issues. However, they said everything is fine. Finally at boarding, I was stopped from boarding saying that I need a visa for Panama because I'll have to get down to get my luggage and hence will need to exit the transit zone. When I said this is Turkish Airlines fault then as I had clearly asked them about luggage, the guy admitted it was messed up by whoever gave me boarding pass. However, then they made up some rule that because my return flight to London is not through Panama but rather through Amsterdam with KLM, hence I need a visa for Panama. I have no idea what rule is this and why should my return flight have anything to do with my transit visa. I asked them to show this in writing and they just wrote the reasons on my boarding pass! I asked them for written proof which can be validated and have been trying to contact them over this from the time I have returned back to London. They keep closing the tickets and do not still provide any proof. The latest ticket is still open since Sep 20th and they have just stopped responding.

Their grievance process, which they call “Feedback”, is disconnected and frustrating. I will not use Turkish Airlines again. Turkish Airlines cancelled my return flight, yet never notified me. They say, by their “Feedback” email response, that they sent me a SMS about the flight cancellation on February 18, 2022. My text message log shows no such message. That would be a message that would have grabbed my attention and led me to make alternative arrangements. No contact from them was made by phone, email or text about this. They did have all of my correct contact information, demonstrated by several texts and emails received about small changes in my outbound flight time. I also was not notified at my outbound flight check in that the return flight was cancelled. No alternative flight was booked by Turkish Airlines. This led to my being stuck at the Tel Aviv airport, having to return to the city overnight, and flying out the next day: a 19 hour delay and extra $489 of expenses. Turkish Airlines denied all responsibility and did not provide any compensation. There was a United Airlines (a Star Alliance partner) flight 4 hours later than my cancelled flight, which I requested on the phone with a customer service representative and from the ticketing agent at the airport, but this was not granted. Customer Service by Feedback is a brick wall. It is all done by email, and their email response closes the case.  The phone customer service agents tell you that everything is handled by Feedback email. The Turkish Airlines website says that they aim to respond to Feedback within 1 week. This does not provide any assistance when you need it at the time of your travel. All of my responses to Feedback came more than 1 week after submission, and only after I called and was told that the response will be expedited. Feedback 1: after 3 weeks and no response, I called, and was told I need to send a new Feedback email. Feedback 2: Claim denied. They allegedly sent me a SMS on Feb 18, which was more than 14 days before my flight, and that absolves them of responsibility. Their email also says that they offered an alternative flight 2 hours later. Feedback 3: I submitted my text log from Feb 17 and 18 showing no message was delivered to me. I pointed out that I was at the airport at 6 am for my 8:30 am flight, I was not offered a 10:30 am flight that they say they offered me in February, and a 10:30 am flight did not connect with any flights from Istanbul to San Francisco.

Then, we moved to common line, but of course our place was already took by other passengers and the staff told we have to get to the end of the line.

My friend who is 186 cm tall had a hard time seating in the middle seat. Despite expensive price for the tickets, Turkish does not allow to choose your own seat - not when you buy nor when you check-in. Seat prices were ridiculously priced, where the extra legroom cost almost 90 EUR per person, per flight. My food was served lukewarm and the fresh bread was served to our hands before we could use their wipes to clean them. Taste was acceptable, portions are somewhat generous but the ingredients were repeating themselves. That includes our return flight.

I bought 3 tickets for myself, my wife and my 19 month old son since we need extra room when we are flying. We flew from Los Angeles to Tashkent via Istanbul and back from Tashkent to Los Angeles after spending 2 weeks in Tashkent with 3 days stop in Istanbul. We really liked Istanbul and it's touristic attractions. We bought tickets via Expedia and I paid full price for my son's ticket. When checking in in Istanbul TK representatives told us that we have to buy new ticket for our son since the one we bought was a child ticket, but it has to be a baby ticket as our son is under 2 years old. They told us that on previous 3 hops TK made a mistake allowing our baby onboard and they sent us to to a ticket office where I got charged an additional 130 USD for a new ticket for our son. It's the kind of Turkish Bazar experience you get when you deal with TK. It was a very stressful situation for our family as we were almost late to our flight to LA. I was very angry and was not able to sleep during our flight to LA. It's a completely different experience with Turkish Airlines in other countries as in Tashkent/Uzbekistan and Los Angeles their representatives are more customer focused. 3 years ago I had another bad experience with Turkish Airlines in Istanbul when TK oversold tickets to our flight to Los Angeles. They push people who bought tickets in advance with cheaper rates to stay and chose a different flight making a priority for those who paid higher buying tickets closer to departure date. That creates a stressful experience for the passengers since they don't have seats on their boarding passes. They first push you that you don't have seat available and later gamble proposing bonuses to passengers to abandon a flight and you have to stand firm to take your flight. Somebody agrees at the end to abandon a flight. Our Turkish Airlines experience was so bad that it spoilt our impression about our vacation in Turkey.

Started with a very poor check-in experience using their appp, and wouldn't progress past the seat selection stage where it kept glitching so I had to do it on my laptop instead, and then the app wouldn't show the boarding passes. Then, at the gate despite an announcement saying boarding would be by seat number, it was simply a free-for-all and the staff didn't even try to order things. I was in the middle passengers to board the aircraft. As I was at the end of the tunnel just about to get on the plane, the airport staff brought down passengers with mobility issues or requiring assistance. Myself and another passenger stood aside as asked (and as you should do) to await these passengers being boarded. Turns out that was a big mistake - several other passengers pushed past us (and those with mobility issues), which is relevant later. When finally aboard, it was clear that the flight was overbooked as noone could find anywhere to put their bags and the queue in the aisle was very long and slow. The passengers who had shoved past were getting their bags slotted into the last remaining spaces by crew. I also noted one gentleman who had severe mobility issues and who had been brought to the aircraft by wheelchair being asked to move seats by a crew member and struggling to do so with no assistance. Then I was told that my bag would need to be put in the hold. I tried to protest, explaining that I had intentionally travelled long-haul with hand luggage only to avoid these waits at the carousel and potential delays and missed connections, and had had recent terrible experiences with this, but the crew were entirely unhelpful and just chucked lots of our bags in the hold. These are all people who boarded around the middle of the cohort, so I can only imagine how many bags were relegated to hold in total. There were no reminders from staff to remove important or disallowed items from bags before they were taken to the hold - hopefully noone left their passports in there! This was all followed up by one of the most uncomfortable seat experiences of my life - and that's coming from someone who can sleep pretty much anywhere. There was barely any legroom, the seats weren't particularly comfy and as soon as the person in front reclined even slightly the screen was practically in your face. Arm rests also in an odd position. No USB or other charging points which is quite unusual these days. Not woken for my meal, so didn't have anything, and was only lucky to catch someone's eye long enough to get a drink.

There was no food or drink offered, no accommodation, just a new boarding pass. Having sat in an uncomfortable chair for the delay and waiting for the first flight out in the morning, my flight took off and arrived in Kayseri. I had a bad feeling at the luggage collection and just knew my bad luck was to continue. No sign of my luggage and the conveyor belt stopped. I was told to go to another location of the airport as my luggage was there. On arriving, I was told my luggage was still in Manchester and had not been loaded to my original flight. I registered my contact details and was given a reference number and number on Whatsapp. I was told my luggage would be there the next day. One night without my luggage wasn't ideal but manageable. The next day I whatsapped the number, which was Kayseri airport, not Turkish Airlines and they said it had not arrived and to contact the airline. I had to call an international number, costing me money each time, to get information on where my bag was. I was told later that day it would arrive. I got no call and followed up that day, no luggage. I was in Kayseri for 4 days and my luggage didn't arrive there at any point. 4 days without my own clothes, toiletries, shoes, etc. Each day, I received no communication from the airline and had to call them, at a cost, to see where it was.

I had to go shopping on Day 3, to buy new underwear, clothes and shoes, as I could not wear the same clothes the whole time. The airline said keep all receipts for costs associated with this and I would be compensated. My luggage finally arrived in Istanbul airport, when I left Kayseri after 4 days and 4 nights without my luggage. It cost me over $200 to buy new clothes, taxis, phone costs, etc. It ruined the 4 days in Kapadokya.  On returning home, I tried to get compensation for the lost luggage, which has been a nightmare.

At their airport stand they send me to a Turkish Airlines agency, at the Turkish Airlines agency they send me to their central offices in Taksim.

There was no food or drink offered, just a new boarding pass and deal with the consequences. No phone call was offered to reorganize our trip, just promises the hotel will provide it. Of course the hotel didn’t do such thing. I know that delays happens but real customer support, correct and valid information or some kindness would make it easier.

It's a shocker that TK hasn't remotely kept up with their competition in this regard. It's like flying business class in the 1990s. Power ports in inaccessible locations rarely work, seat controls inadequate. So instead of a review of 10/10 I'd love to give, it gets knocked down to 5/10 as a result of all of this. I would not use TK in this configuration unless there was no other choice or the price was very cheap. They desperately need a refresh of this old livery or just new planes.

When in reality, you simply fill in the SG arrival pass and you are good to go. Which I explained and told her exactly where she could find this information.  I turned to the other gate agent and showed my passport and let me on the flight. While on my trip I had my trip rescheduled twice and I spotted something different with my flight. It seemed like my flight had been split up into two single journeys instead of a connecting one. Which would mean I had to check out my luggage and check it in again during my transfer. So I call their agents asking to confirm if this is the case and to double check if my tickets are still connecting. First one said bit to quickly, yes everything is fine with your tickets no worry. I message their facebook page to ask the same question with more details, they say it’s no issue and they tickets are connected.

2023-03-30,"""the worst travel experience of our lives""",1,"✅ Trip Verified | We were loyal Turkish Airlines fliers for many years until this experience. Our saga started when we purchased 4 business class segments for my wife and my honeymoon in February 2022 for almost $8K. Due to Covid, we tried to change them over the course of the next year. This airline has arbitrary change fees that are not listed anywhere on their website. They are allowed to quote you whatever fees they would like at the time of the change request. As such, we were told that our new tickets would need to be roughly $5600 to qualify for the change, with an additional $600 per ticket change fees, so $9k in total for a $5600 flight. We agreed, but disputed the change fee with Amex. Amex found in our favor for $600, issuing the credit and we looked forward to our honeymoon. Fast forward, we arrived to the gate in February 2023 for our new flight and were told for the first time that our tickets were *suspended* and that we no longer had tickets. After speaking to ticketing agents and phone agents, both of which said there was nothing they could do (more on this later) we finally were able to speak to the Newark sales manager who was highly unprofessional and unhelpful, trying to convince us that we were not owed anything and essentially ""too bad"". In the end, we were forced to purchase last minute economy tickets for almost $4K with a one way upgrade for $2500, as we did not want to jeopardize our hotel reservation and ruin our honeymoon further. Over the course of the next 2 weeks, like many here, we emailed the feedback form many times (as others noted, this airline's phone personnel have no authority to make any financial decisions and all must be done via online feedback forms). We received many unhelpful responses, refusing to give us any compensation or help us in any way. All references were made to speak to ""our bank."" Finally, we decided to upgrade our economy leg home for another $2500 and take this matter up when we got home. In the end, we paid about $8600 just to have to pay another $8.5K and fly in two 8 hour economy segments versus the 4 business segments we originally purchased. I'm sure that in the meantime, Turkish resold our original seats last minute for much higher than the original $8k we paid 5 months before the flight. In short, this was the worst travel experience of our lives and showed clearly the unethical business practices of this airline. 1) They will suspend your tickets without notice, forcing customers to purchase last minute segments at the gate. There are numerous other cases here of flier having their tickets arbitrarily suspended. 2) You will not be able to make changes, receive refunds or do any customer service action of any value through the phone with them. You will be forced to use an antiquated online ""feedback form"" that does not even track your previous correspondence. There are no personnel in any airport, including in Istanbul that have the authority to issue flight changes, credits or refunds. 3) They do not have a clear change fee policy. If you need to change your flight, be prepared to spend months trying to communicate with them on the aforementioned form and in the end they can quote you any amount, you're on your own.

The problem arose with my additional baggage. I had already paid for an extra bag with Turkish Airlines, but they failed to carry forward this payment to my new flight with Air India. I had to pay for the same additional bag twice. I reached out to Turkish Airlines for a refund and compensation, but they directed me to Air Canada, claiming it was a codeshare flight operated by Air Canada. However, this is not true, as the flight I am talking about, TK717, was operated by Turkish Airlines. I have tried to communicate with Turkish Airlines multiple times, providing them with the correct information, but they keep diverting responsibility and have not resolved my issue. It is incredibly frustrating and disappointing to be treated this way by an airline I had trusted. Based on my experience, I give Turkish Airlines 1 star out of 5.

Service onboard the plane is fine but at airport IST you feel like you are a nuisance to the surly and moody staff.

2023-05-02,"""are not going to reimburse""",5,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst communication. We booked a flight from Dallas to Naples via Istanbul. The first flight was delayed. They told us this ends up with us missing the second flight and being put onto a flight 15 hours later than our booked flight. The second flight was scheduled for 8.25 am, the next day. The airline provided us with a hotel room and dinner in Istanbul, but they didn't provide breakfast. To use the hotel, we had to enter the city and get a visa. Turkish Airlines agent told us to pay visa by ourselves and then submit the receipts to the airline to get reimbursed, and we did. After our trip, I called their customer service, and they told me to submit the receipts through the website Feedback section. I did. Feedback responded and asked for more documents. I sent them the visa pages in the passport and all boarding passes and payment receipts. Feedback responded to me that they closed the case and are not going to reimburse. It looks weird. After getting all they needed, they refused to pay and closed the case. Again, I called customer service, and they put an objection on the case. My question is why they waste customer's time. If the Feedback department is not able to do the reimbursement, why does staff tell the customer to go through Feedback to get reimbursed. If the Feedback is able to reimburse, why do they refuse to pay after asking for more documents. It seems no one knows how to resolve this case. Just wasting our time.

We tried to reach out to the call centre in Istanbul to request for an upgrade to Business Class as the flight was an overnight flight between Istanbul and Abu Dhabi.

2023-05-10,"""good product for long haul fights""",7,"Not Verified |  
I flew on Business class on Turkish Airlines for a roundtrip flight to Bali, Indonesia from Montreal Canada with a connection in Istanbul, turkey. The aircrafts were an Airbus A350 and a Boeing 787 which were nice, spacious and seem in a good condition. The seats had plenty of legroom and space to have a pleasant trip specially on long flights but are similar to other major airlines. One issue about the business class seats is that we can't see from the windows because of the seat conception which is inconvenient for a lot of passengers. The flight attendants were not very service oriented and did not seem very friendly. Usually the crew start to take the meal orders before the plane pushes back but on my last leg they did it once the plane was airborne. The crew from and to Bali legs were a bit better. Some of them don't even ask if we needed something else or a drink during the meal service and they took a very long time take the dishes. I had to ask twice to get my drink and another time later for a coffee which was very long to have it. However the food was tasty and good. The in flying entertainment was also good and had many choices of movies and TV shows. The flights were uneventful but pleasant in general besides the crew with the seat that can be turn into a bed with a big screen tv. Overall Turkish airlines has a good product for long haul fights and delicious food.

2023-05-14,"""comfortable and enjoyable experience""",10,"✅ Trip Verified |  What a wonderful experience with Turkish Airlines! Got to fly their new Business Class on the A350-900, and it was a really comfortable and enjoyable experience. The staff were quite welcoming and warm (though, I must admit, during the flight, it was hard to get their attention, and I don't like using the flight attendant call button). The in-flight entertainment was excellent, lots of choice of movies and music, and there was plenty of space (and privacy) in the new pod to rest as well as work comfortably. The food on TK has consistently been excellent, and this flight was no exception; it was truly a feast on board, with so many courses for the main meal after take off, and a fulfilling breakfast just before landing. A wide variety of options, and a very friendly on-board chef to prepare it for you. The wifi was difficult to connect to on my phone, but worked fine on my laptop (it was free for Business Class and Elite passengers) The cabin was clean and also kept immaculate throughout the flight. The check-in and baggage transfer and delivery on the other end went flawlessly--and the IST lounge was an excellent place to rest during the transit (with lots of food and drink options). I would really recommend Turkish, and the price was quite competitive for flights from Asia to Europe, with good connection times.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,2303,Business,Singapore to Istanbul,April 2023,A359,1,1,Turkish Airlines,Turkey
2023-05-17,"""one of the worst flight experiences""",1,"✅ Trip Verified | Very poor customer services. On the last flight we were told by ground staff there are not enough meals on board so we wont get any (only in case of leftovers) and we can write a complaint to the airline afterwards. When questioning the crew why we would not get any meal if we have a full price ticket, the board crew reacted very rudely and we received different answers, first as the flight is overbooked and then as we checked in as one of the last passengers (should not matter how many hours before we check as we had a valid full price ticket). At the end we received two meals, but which seemed to be from different passengers who didn't finish or want it, as several items were already missing, and one meal was already opened. However, we did not complain anymore and accepted it. Before landing another crew member came unsolicited to us again and kept arguing with us again in a very rude manner and we should be happy that we received anything and finally she left saying that's not her responsibility. In addition, we were traveling with an infant and did not get offered baby food, while other customers did. When filing a feedback with the airline afterwards, we only got the answer that they investigated but could not find any ""meal service irregularities"" on the flight and also no improper behavior of crew members (wonder how they investigate that). After some forth and back and only the typical prefabricated customer service answers and even some answers that have nothing to do with my complain (e.g. they said I should have informed the crew members - that was actually my complaint, and in a second answer that I would have to submit a doctors report) not addressing the issue at all, I gave up. It seems nobody is really reading the feedback, they only copy past some generic prefabricated answers. In addition, on the return flight our stroller that we left at the gate was handled without any care. We even saw from the airplane window how the stroller was tossed around while unloading (even ground staff I guess is probably not airline responsibility). The stroller and the basket had scratches all over the place. Even the rain cover that we put over to protect the basket to some extent was destroyed. Not to mention the delays of one hour sitting in the airline waiting for departure with an infant on each of our two flights. Overall, one of the worst flight experiences and one of the most impolite cabin crew. And even booked the more expensive TK ticket, compared to low-cost airlines for example, expecting better service in particular as we were traveling with an infant. But it turned out to be a pretty disappointing experience flying with TK and not any better than a low-cost airline.

2023-05-21,"""not the service they stated""",2,"✅ Trip Verified |  1 week before my scheduled flight I was sent an email stating my flight from Zanzibar to Istanbul on May 3rd was canceled. This email gave no alternative flights or assistance to get another flight, they said it was canceled. When I called Turkish they stated I could cancel the entire ticket or go home on a different day, not much of a choice. I couldn’t get credit for the second leg, even though they only canceled the second leg. I moved my flight to one day earlier and left my trip on may 2nd causing me to incur charges for the hotel stay for a night I couldn’t use. Day of the flight the flight was delayed over an hour with only a 2 hour connection to my second flight on their airline. I asked if I would miss the connection and they stated I would not and the plane would be held because we would land about 6pm and the flight started boarding at 6:50 pm instead of holding the plane they had an agent get me off the plane as soon as we landed and I thought I was being rushed to my flight, but no they were rushing me to the lounge because they had already booked me on another flight the next day. So I lost another day of my vacation because I had to stay overnight in Istanbul. I also had to get a visa for Istanbul unexpectedly because I had to leave the airport. None of this was explained to me it all just happened. On May 2nd my return flight, we were headed to the airport and our cab driver told us our flight was delayed 2 hours. No email or text form Turkish airlines. We get inside the airport and flight still shows on time, I call Turkish and they said it was on time. Got to the counter and was told by that the flight was in fact delayed 2 hours and we would miss our connection and they knew about it 4 hours prior to me asking. So why weren’t we told because again we are going to miss our connection to their next flight. So I asked to be booked on the flight for the 4th because the flight on the 3rd was canceled (my original flight home). They were not willing to do that all they said they could do was put us on the delayed flight and put me on a later flight to JFK, which now I miss connection from JFK to Florida and I need a hotel in New York.  So my friend and I check in same time with same person, but when I get to JFK I have no luggage and she does. They placed my luggage on the flight to Istanbul the next morning.

Not a huge issue but the bad experience kept getting more irritating. The plane fine, well equipped, very helpful and welcoming staff. But there’s poor info on the website about the seats. Seat map shows 2 seats, an aisle and 2 seats. Seat map of TK website is not accurate, it’s actually one seat, an aisle, two seats, an aisle and one seat. So we were a couple on a 13 hour flight, separated by an aisle and the two seats were offset by approximately 15 inches so we couldn’t even converse across the aisle. Not a fatal flaw but an example of sloppiness. We took off an hour late with no explanation or a “we’re sorry” comment which would have been a nice touch.
