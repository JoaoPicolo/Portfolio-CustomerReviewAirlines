2014-01-06,Lufthansa customer review,9,FRA-DXB return flight. Very good service on the way out. Good flight nice crew very uneventful. On the way back almost as good. The 747 landed in heavy clouds and didn't feel a thing. Entertainment is ok but not at the level of say Air Canada. On the way back I asked for lactose-free meal and got one that was pretty good. A great airline and a great experience.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-07,Lufthansa customer review,10,Dusseldorf-Kiev return. Depart DÃ¼sseldorf Jan 1 2014 LH 3004. Return Kiev Jan 5 2014 LH 3005. Both flights on time service on board and catering very good. No inflight entertainment.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,2,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-07,Lufthansa customer review,10,DEL-FRA-SZB in Business. Check-in was easy the new lounge in Delhi has sufficient space free wifi and pretty good snacks and drinks. On board the lie-flat seats on the 747-800 were very comfortable and I had a good sleep. Flight was on-time and the breakfast before landing was very tasty (I had the Indian breakfast).,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,3,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-07,Lufthansa customer review,9,LH456 from FRA to LAX on Jan 2 2014 with a Boeing 747-8 aircraft seat 1K. Excellent service and excellent food in the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and on the plane to LAX. Highly recommended! Everything was presented very well and the quality was perfect. I also like the Bose noise cancellation headphones that the seat is equipped with.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,4,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-07,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH 419 from IAD to FRA. The lounge in IAD is less than average for First Class. The first Class seats are good and LH provides a heavy mattress and bedding to sleep. However LH has a policy of keeping the cabin at 23 deg C which is just too warm to sleep with all the heavy blankets I wish they would cool their cabin to a normal temp. The food was ok but certainly not great. The service from the flight staff was excellent. Finding my connection in Frankfurt was quite difficult and took quite a while to find the first class lounge.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,5,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-07,Lufthansa customer review,10,Lufthansa continues to have fantastic economy service. The air hostesses tend to be older than other airlines but their experience shows in the brilliant service given. The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. Additionally the beer on board is better than other airlines Warsteiner. The food is similar to others in the same category - the only complaint is the number of films available. Perhaps there are 50 different films but compared to Etihad or others this falls a bit short by today's standards. I was on a new Boeing 747-8 which is rare as I almost always fly Airbus routes which may have made my trip more enjoyable.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,6,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-08,Lufthansa customer review,7,Very good and attentive service on 431 from ORD to FRA on January 3rd - even though it was economy class. The meal quality was bad completely tasteless chicken and the seats plus legroom too narrow too much of a sardine box feeling during a long distance flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,7,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-08,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 456 on January 4 2014. The flight from FRA to LAX was delayed 2 hours at take off due to first a technical problem and second an ill passenger whose luggage had to be removed from the airplane. At arrival the plane was only one hour late because of a higher cruising speed the plane was rather new (747-8) and comfortable the food was good - quite a positive surprise on a trans-atlantic flight. Only the cabin temperature was unpleasantly low - and this is rather frequently found in LH long distance flights.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,8,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-08,Lufthansa customer review,7,IAD-FRA on B747-8 and FRA-IAH A380. Both flights were good. Friendliness in Business is much better than Economy. Good food and Service on both legs. Lounge in IAD with separate access gate to the plane is a plus. The new Business on the B747-8 let the old one on the A380 feel really outdated. It was hard to get a seat in the Z-Gate Business Lounge in FRA.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,9,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-09,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH457: I was quite satisfied with this flight. Stewards and stewardesses were friendly food was of good quality and entertainment offered was very good. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed the cartoons. I would suggest that if seats are available travellers with children could be positioned in the plane so that they can be given an extra seat so the child can sleep better. Of course if the flight is full I understand that this is not at all feasible.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,11,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-09,Lufthansa customer review,10,"Flight LH434 from Munich to Chicago was a real pleasure. Smooth ride and super crew - friendly and professional.

2014-01-10,Lufthansa customer review,8,VCE-FRA-AMS on 28 December 2013 and then AMS-FRA-VCE on 3 January 2014. Flights were all nice and all on time on comfortable A321 and A319. It didn't make sense that they gave us food on 16:35 pm flight to AMS and not on 12:45 pm flight to FRA but this is just an insignificant detail. Staff was good and smiling and flight experience was good too. I recommend Lufthansa.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,13,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-13,Lufthansa customer review,9,Flight 490 from Frankfurt / Germany to Seattle / WA on January 6 2014. Very punctual smooth flight. On board service very good. Temperature in plane too low. Entertainment programme and internet service excellent. Digital flight information very good. Meal service fine except for oversight to remove moist cloth and empty cups/cans before serving dinner. Overall impression very good.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,14,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-13,Lufthansa customer review,10,30 December 2013 Paris to Tbilisi via Munich LH2237 and LH2556. 8 January 2014 Tbilisi to Paris via Munich LH2557 and LH2230. Check-in was easy and pleasant with brilliant ground staff in Tbilisi. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working especially on the MUC-TBS leg on 30 December. Hot food was served in MUC-TBS-MUC segments and it was very tasty both times. Lufthansa and Turkish are recommended airlines for travelers to Tbilisi.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,15,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-13,Lufthansa customer review,10,Manchester UK to Munich LH 2501. Munich to Chicago LH434. I travel with Lufthansa regularly from Great Britain to USA in either Business or First Class. The overall service is always excellent. I can fly directly to the USA from Manchester (UK) but the standard and service of the US Airlines is way below that offered by Lufthansa. Meals are always excellent seating extremely comfortable and cabin staff courteous and helpful. Travelling via Germany adds to my journey time but I find it well worthwhile. Additionally the standard of Lufthansa Lounges are far superior to US Airline ones.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,16,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,8,FRA to ORD. I slept most of the time on board so there was not much I had to complain about. Flight attendants very nice and friendly. Boarding in FRA is always very chaotic. It is much better organized in ORD. LH should handle the boarding procedure for FRA like they do it in ORD. I'd recommend that Lufthansa would send an e-mail notification when the plane changes so that passengers who book early can make sure that they can keep their reserved seat.,Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,yes,17,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,9,Frankfurt to Washington Dulles on Jan 8 flight LH418. Return on Jan 10th flight LH419. I have been flying Lufthansa for many years now both professionally and privately. It is not a cheap airline but I admit that I still use it for my private trips because of the impeccable quality of service at all levels. As a Senator passenger I know I get more perks but I see all the time the genuine attention that the staff puts in when dealing with every passenger. After having delt for many years with numerous american airlines I find this very refreshing!,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,18,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-16,Lufthansa customer review,8,DOH-FRA-YVR: Both legs of flight on A340 aircraft. Not my optimum choice of long-haul platform; however Lufthansa really made the best of things. Traveled economy both legs yet found that both seat space and leg room were more than adequate. Food was so-so and selection of movies average. However cabin crew were very attentive and customer oriented. This airline is becoming my airline of choice.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,20,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-16,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 415 Washington-Munich. 10/11 Jan 2014. Overall very good. Friendly service. Good (new) business class seats.

The new 747-8 aircraft offers a modern ambience in the Economy class LH standard seats with individual now well-functioned entertainment system but still the usual limited space.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,23,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-20,Lufthansa customer review,10,Flight LH430 was perfect. New Business class seats are really good and comfortable. I've received the upgrade from the economy with no additional costs. Entertainment was ok but sleep on the plane was better and the traveler kit was very helpful. I'll do it again.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,24,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-21,Lufthansa customer review,6,It's always a pleasure flying with Lufthansa. The flight LH 490 was ready on time for departure and the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile. The aircraft was new and cleanliness in the cabin was satisfactory. This time there was no aerobridge and the boarding was via bus. This added to a bit of inconvenience to some passengers. The new Airbus cabin storage is comparatively small and passengers had to struggle finding a place to put their carry on luggage. Overall the food and beverages selection was good. I would highly recommend this flight to my family and friends.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,25,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-21,Lufthansa customer review,8,The flight (LH431) was as expected good. The chosen seat was good for my long legs. Departure and Arrival was nearly on time. Only the served breakfast was very poor.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,26,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-22,Lufthansa customer review,10,Flight DUS-MUC in the evening. Short flight from DUS to MUC. Friendly staff free Drinks (water tea coffee wine bear soft drinks) and savory snacks.

2014-01-22,Lufthansa customer review,5,LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. The flight went smoothly and on time (arriving ahead of schedule). No complaints about the flight conditions and service except the performance of the information/entertainment system. The touch screen was not responding thus making the use impossible. I see two main problems - the system is outdated and not properly serviced. However this was a smaller problem for me compared with the failure of the promised Wi-Fi connection.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,28,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-22,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH428. Positives: Smooth trip to U.S. Good service nice entertainment program nice food and drinks. To improve: Seat was in the last row of the plane and I didn't had so much space for my legs.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,29,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-22,Lufthansa customer review,4,Frankfurt (FRA) to Washington Dulles (IAD) LH 418 on December 9 2013. Space comfort in economy class is not great there should be more space! The entertainment program quality was not great it appears to me that mainly only old films are shown in economy class not quite sure if this has something to do with cost savings. I don't understand the beverage concept of Lufthansa I wish there was more non alcoholic beer on board.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,30,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-25,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH430 FRA-ORD Jan 20 2014 New 747-8. Seat comfort is inferior to most other airlines on this segment. Loyalty customer treatment (especially in regards to complimentary upgrades) is unacceptable seems non-existent all the way up to Senator (incl.) and might become real only with HON which is super exclusive. Food quality is average and staff attention in economy is also just average. Staff attention visibly improves from business class onwards. Inflight entertainment is a bad joke especially in economy as well as in any 'old' business or first class seat. Tiny monitors that are often defective. Fairly small movie selection. This is way behind the other airlines that LH wants to compete with. Economy seats in the new 747-8 are ok but seat comfort in the first economy aisle seat right behind business class is impacted by staff continuously pushing the blinds against the passengers legs.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,32,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-28,Lufthansa customer review,2,HEL-MUC/FRA-MAD return. I don't like their new loyalty program downgrade. I booked quite high priced booking class ticket last year hoping to earn more miles and to renew my Frequent Flyer status and loyalty with them just to be faced with the fact that earning miles is now 25% - 50% from mileage flown unless you pay full Y or C priced ticket. 23hrs check in before flight is useless 3 of my 4 flights were of change of equipment and I was automatically moved from reserved first Y row seat to the last rows of the bus. Very inconvenient as I had to wait a long time to get deplaned. Their onboard product has downgraded with NEK seat. 2 x 2hr 20min flight segments resulted me back muscle pain. Seat is so thin and narrow making noises when moving on it it is the most uncomfortable way to travel. Their refreshment offering is okay but snacks are inedible - no healthy and fresh options anymore. Cabin crew did their best service was professional with smiles. Lounge access was good as layovers were 3hrs 30min too long. Loyalty for this airline is completely useless for me I will change my loyalty to another Scandinavian carrier with better timetables.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,33,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-28,Lufthansa customer review,7,I fly Lufthansa a lot long distance. Overall a very solid impression mostly on time friendly and competent staff. Quality of meals has decreased in economy as has seat comfort but that is normal these days. Major complaint on LH456 (FRA-LAX) on a 747-8: The touch screen user experience was ridiculous some input takes 10-20 s to be processed. Not only the case in my seat but pretty much everyone I observed had this problem.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,34,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-28,Lufthansa customer review,7,Flew CGN-MUC on a Saturday. Onward flight was nearly empty so you could seat any seat. Two drinks one coffee and one apple juice on a nice Airbus 321. Return flight on the same day was packed so all bins where overloaded. It took ages to board. Got drinks as well crew did a good job for a 55 minutes flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,35,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-28,Lufthansa customer review,2,I travelled flight LH456 on Saturday 18th January from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. It was extremely cold on this plane due to some problems with the air-conditioning (seat 33H). Other passengers seated in rows in front of me were complaining as it was too hot on their seats! This must be a major problem and to be honest I was very dissatisfied with this situation. The flight attendants did a great job.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,36,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Unfortunately my last flight: Frankfurt/Los Angeles (LH 456) was an exception. Having been offered a complimentary upgrade to Business Class at the gate I was then downgraded on board back to Economy with minimal apology nor effort to find a suitable alternative. (I understood the issue as the Business Class seat had in fact been sold to a passenger on Business Class standby but given my status and the value of business I give LH every year it was disappointing). On this occasion the situation was made worse by a particularly difficult neighbor and some average service on board. As I said not a normal experience with Lufthansa but frustrating all the same.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,45,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Business having own check-in was nice staff being polite except supervisor having an argument with a customer at next counter. Almost better than real TV. For Business Class passengers there was own boarding lane. At Cabin boarding drink with choices were offered. Business class has lie flat seats but not latest fully flat yet. According to my knowledge Lufthansa is installing new fully flats on their fleet. During flight the service was nice first with cocktail and snacks. 15min later came food service with appetizers with choices. From three warm choices you can choose your main course.

This caused chaos in ORD as they were short 16 business class seats all passengers had to be reassigned their seats which caused my family to be split up and in middle seats - at several thousand dollars each we were not happy. Crew tried their best but no one would move and we were seated all over the cabin. Food was mediocre at best on this route and angled seats did not provide for great sleeping. Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines. Arrival at DEL was a mess with business and first class bags off-loaded last which annoyed premium paying passengers. Only highlight really was LH Senator Lounge in FRA which was very nice. For the price paid I would try another carrier.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,55,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-18,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flight 457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt was delayed due a technical problem. Unfortunately there was no assistance for me at the arrival gate since my flight connection was half an hour later I had to rush pass again through the security check and immigration. I arrived breathless at the gate of my flight to Florence where we were told that they had to change the aircraft due to a technical problem. I had to wait for another hour. Concerning the service on board and the aircraft (a new B747-800) I have nothing to complain about.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,56,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-18,Lufthansa customer review,9,LH431 from ORD to FRA. These long haul flights now have wifi which was a pleasant surprise. Apart from that the cabin was not particularly full which made it easy to put the bag under the seat next to me etc. I suspect the comfort would be diminished if it was otherwise. Apart from that no other surprises the food was good the staff polite the flight was on schedule.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,57,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-20,Lufthansa customer review,10,Feb 18 2014: Lufthansa - LH1817 - Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC). This segment was part of a five flight itinerary with United Airlines a review of which can be found under their name. This particular Lufthansa experience was as always superbly efficient on the ground in both Barcelona and Munich. Navigating airports at either end was a breeze and the embarkation and disembarkation process easy and smooth. The flight itself had both an on-time departure and arrival and the in-flight service was as expected superb and efficient as one would expect from Lufthansa. Always a treat to fly with Lufthansa and will continue to do so whenever possible.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,58,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-20,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 410 MUC to JFK 1st Feb 2014. The flight was fully booked but it was ok. Crew very friendly. Since I was sitting at rear I had only one meal left to choose. The space for my feet was very limited because of some mounted housings under the seat in front. Too little space to place something like a bottle of water and a book. Plane was new and in good shape.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,59,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-21,Lufthansa customer review,6,Unfortunately we were unable to use the online check-in service on the Lufthansa homepage. This service is apparently unavailable when you have a connecting flight in Los Angeles (LAX to FRA) and come from the Big Island of Hawaii - Kona Airport for that matter - meaning that our 4 tickets were scattered all over the plane. Luckily this problem could easily be solved by a friendly member of the Lufthansa ground staff in LA. The flight from LA to Frankfurt was okay overall seats on the 747-8I are not the most uncomfortable though a little too lightly padded. Dinner and Breakfast were offered - both were quite good. The inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies in various languages (sadly variety was not that great) the flight attendant were generally nice. We would recommend Lufthansa.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,60,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-24,Lufthansa customer review,9,Early-morning feeder flights from to Frankfurt and back outbound on a brand new A320 return on an older plane with newish cabin. The core product is rather basic both in terms of comfort and services but the planes were spotless the crews extremely professional and the slimline seats at least provide decent legroom. LH still serves nice breakfast and drinks even on these short hops and there is really nothing major to complain about. One thing to improve is seat assignment in economy which tends to get really messy at times.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,61,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-02-25,Lufthansa customer review,6,Disappointed with the recent Buenos Aires to Frankfurt flight. Several crew members seemed rude and unmotivated when an elderly lady boarded with a light and small suitcase the flight attendant refused to help her stow it away. Other occasions the crew were not helpful: to a family travelling with small children removing food plates instead they walked over it and complained about it. Other than that service was been ok flight attendants served passengers with water and juice several times during the night in addition to the self-service bar area with small snacks and beverages. Dinner was ok breakfast was very disappointing. Unfortunately there are not many alternatives on this route.

Nothing to say on the service although the seats do need an upgrade it does not contribute to the full experience as the entire flight overall is good. The entertainment system (AVOD) is easy to use although late responding but with a good selection of films music and travel information. Overall a very nice experience and flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,66,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-28,Lufthansa customer review,9,Flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Great value for money. Food was delicious.

2014-03-03,Lufthansa customer review,7,SIN-FRA-BHX in Economy. First leg from Singapore on the A380 was great largely because I was fortunate enough to get an exit row seat with unlimited legroom (judging by fellow passengers one wouldn't be happy with normal seats as they had rather pathetic legroom). Nice modern AVOD system but the PTVs were rather small compared to other A380 airlines. Service was really friendly and warm but few frills (no amenity kit whatsoever no footrests). Meals were alright but again rather simple compared to Asian carriers. Second leg to Birmingham on an A320 was above average by intra-Europe standards with a decent snack/beverage service and friendly service again. All flights on time.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,68,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-03-03,Lufthansa customer review,3,"Flights LH720 and LH721 from FRA to PEK and back. Everything written regarding the Lufthansa business class seats is absolutely true. Outbound flight on new 747-8 with new business class seats which are flat beds. Unfortunately if you are satt near the window in flat bad position it is almost impossible to get out of the ""bed"" without disturbing your co-passenger. On top your feet are very squeezed in the tiny hole at the bottom of the bed. Food choice OK as well as beverages. IFE system I would rate as average. Flight on time. Inbound flight - nightmare instead of 747-8 it was old 747-4. As I checked in online nobody at the counter mentioned that the plane was changed and consequently my seat. Departure late for more than an hour. Old business class seats which are a disaster if you have the idea to sleep during the flight (not flat bed and very uncomfortable). Entertainment system was not working for more than two hours of the flight as needed to be reset. Food on the same level as outbound flight. No soap in the toilette. At the end arrived on time to catch my connecting flight. Overall will use them only if I have to otherwise for the same or lower cost other ME airlines and even the airlines from the Lufthansa group are offering much more for the same buck.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,69,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

My 5th London - Beijing flights with Lufthansa within 2 years and I have to say the quality is stable and consistent as well as good value for money. For both the outbound and inbound paths the flights are on time if not slightly early during the long haul flight several water runs during the night and the staff are the biggest assets providing the friendly efficient and professional services. During the flight between PEK and FRA the new Boeing 747-800 was used it offered the personal power socket and free WIFI onboard which is extremely good value. The only slight drawback is that you can not select seats on the exit rows online and airport check in as they are ""occupied"" however when on board you realised that half of them are empty.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,76,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

All in all this was a great experience.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,108,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-03-24,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH438. Flight and cabin service very good. Attendants very courteous and attentive. Food quality and selection seem to be downgraded from previous flights.

2014-03-24,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH439. Flight and Service very good. Food quality and selection not so good. Seats much too small. Seat in front reclined much too far.

2014-03-24,Lufthansa customer review,7,Flying from the US I always would prefer a non-US Airline. I have been flying LH for quite some time but service and especially food has deteriorated. Since we prefer Airbus instead of flying Boeing we always used the connection via Munich. Maybe next time we will try either KLM or Air France provided we can chose those airlines both ways. We experienced the US airlines with very low standard: service/food/and seating.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,111,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-03-26,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH431. Seats are terrible - the person behind you only has to touch your seat and it feels like a punch in the back. In addition when the person in front of you decides to use the reclining function it's almost impossible to move or get out of your seat. You have to follow suit in order to have some breathing space. A second glass of wine for dinner would have been nice.,Economy Class,N/A,1,1,1,1,yes,112,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-03-26,Lufthansa customer review,1,My 9.30 LH309 flight on 23/3/2014 out of Florence Italy was cancelled due to rain. Only one Lufthansa representative was available to rebook the entire flight's customers. After retrieving our luggage waiting in a long line to rebook through your only available representative in Florence we were to board a bus to take us to Bologna leaving at 13.00. It actually left at 14.15. No representative guided us with instructions on which bus to get on. When we arrived in Bologna one Lufthansa representative said to get into Line 35. When we approached the Lufthansa representative at Line 35 she got annoyed that we were in the wrong line. When I pointed out the gentleman who told us to get in her line she grabbed my ticket and approached that man. She came back without my ticket and told us we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the flight. Finally I got out of line and approached the man showed him my passport to get my ticket back. The meal voucher we were given in Florence was not honored in Bologna. Finally we got our baggage checked and seats assigned in Bologna 2 hours before our flight. When we arrived in Frankfurt no representative was there to greet us and walk us to where we were to get hotel vouchers. The whole experience was awful. Stress levels could have been lessened if Lufthansa people were well-informed and actually gave us correct information and were there to actually meet us and show us where or what we had to do. Walking around the airports in Bologna and Frankfurt with luggage on a wild goose chase because Lufthansa representatives didn't have a clue or gave us misdirection's was very bad mismanagement of customers and very poor customer service. I understand they cannot control the weather but Lufthansa CAN control the information given to customers after a cancellation and actually have representatives in place to guide us at each airport.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,113,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The food was correct (coach standards) but the choice was poor. On the inbound flight to Seattle we got twice the same choice pasta or chicken. Even if they were prepared and cooked differently it was the same choice. I believe it should be possible to offer a 3rd type of meal (fish or meat).

Delightful service with a crew that actually cared about your level of comfort and needs. Food was way above standard for most mainline airlines. This was a second sector flowing on from a UAL connecting flight. The comparisons are beyond explaining. The UAL plane was a 777-200 ER. It was old dirty and basically a disgrace. The crew were in their old United way ""Perfunctory"". They had a job to do. Do it and get the passengers out of their hair. Hence when I look upon LH it is in direct comparison to the former flight. Where LH lost my vote was in baggage. They went on strike in FRA and my bags took two days to locate.

2014-03-31,Lufthansa customer review,6,My preferred airline to keep my status (SEN). I like the fact that they welcome to you personally aboard as a senator. This was not done on this trip however. The next space in the economy is not all that great but that is probably true for most deadlines. What I do not like about Lufthansa is that they have greatly reduce their miles earnings on certain flights as of this year. If my chances to renew my status were further reduced I would probably look into other airlines more often as well. On this trip I had a nice seat in the exit row. Unfortunately I had a huge guy sitting next to me so it was all cramped in anyway. In addition the baby across the aisle cried the entire night however these are not Lufthansa's fault of course. The flight was on time even 20 minutes early.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,124,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Other than for the unfortunate strikes which delayed my original flight plan I found the ground personnel and the flight personnel always helpful polite and very professional. I also appreciated having been warned at least 48 hours ahead of time regarding the strike. It gave me enough time to reschedule and change my itinerary. Lufthansa has always been regarded as a stellar airline. It would be regretful to demote its branding due to the strikes.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,125,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

After over one hour on the phone with the representative I was offered a free of charge rebooking for April 4th ironically the 3rd day of a well pre-planned strike. The representative knew less about the strike and the cancelled flights than I did! After that useless option was given I was offered a seat on the 5th which unfortunately by this time was making the entire trip pointless. I asked for a refund LH declined even if they failed to deliver their part of the transaction.

2014-04-02,Lufthansa customer review,7,"CCS-FRA-TXL and return aboard LH FirstClass in March. Inbound flight was excellent A330-300 with new FC. Check in in CCS was a 5 min thing very efficient and friendly. In CCS they use the AA Admirals Club for FirstClass lounge which was average limited drink selection no food not even snacks. Boarding was fast. Crew were nice and caring Seat was comfy but not as comfy as it looks. It's a lie flat where they put a ""mattress"" on but still quite hard to lie on but at least you can stretch out. Food was good but not outstanding. Transit in FRA is a mess CCS flights always got remote parking no gate! You have to climb off the plane get into Van take a 15min ride to Arrivals B then walk 30+ mins through Immigration customs on to Departures A. Senator Lounge at A Gates is like a luxury hotel full breakfast buffet smoking lounge showers full bar and great service. FRA-TXL leg is only 50 mins they put you in Business in lack of a First in these flights. Return flight was scheduled for March 27 but cancelled due to strike. They rescheduled my flight on the phone for March 28 no problem. TXL-FRA left at 6 am on time. Getting from Arrivals A to Departure C in FRA is disgusting. Endless walking (40+ mins) plus a trip on a train for people with moving limitations almost impossible to handle. Senator Lounge at C Gates very good but not as splendid as the one at A Gates I mentioned before. FRA-CCS decent service same food experience ( same menu) same good vodka same "" so-so"" seats. Nice inflight entertainment with large flatscreen good selection of actual movies and TV series. On time arrival in CCS very fast bag service with FirstClass bags unloaded first.

Plane was completely full passengers were greeted at the entrance door. Friendly and highly professional was the attitude of the 5 flight attendants. Meal service consisted of a warm dish (chicken with vegetables and wedges) a roll with butter rice pudding and a small bottle of water followed by two rounds of drinks. LH still has one of the most generous choices of free drinks non-alcoholic of any kind plus red and white wine sparkling wine beer etc. Announcements from the cockpit were short clear and informative. The cabin design was okay and clean. Due to the thin recaro seats space is sufficient even for larger people.

I was surprised to find out that they had a different lay out so no extra leg room. Thankfully economy section 30% full so I jumped in the seat in front of the bulk. The seat was quite comfortable. Food and beverages quite good. On time performance. Now on the below par section. The cabin was extremely cold and the blankets were small and thin. Complaints made but nothing changed. IFE a bit old without remote control tough to navigate on a low resolution screen. A worn out touch screen with ok variety on movies though. Poor audio and the headsets completely useless. Cabin crew quite the opposite of ANA crew on my inbound FRA-HND. Actually robotic. No smiles no interaction. They served lunch 30 minutes after take off and then disappeared. Only one of them seated in the galley area with a tray of water and juice on a self service mode. After 9 hours they served a dinner box (again as in lunch there was a choice between Japanese and Western). Priority on my luggage was not honored in Athens as my suitcase came out after 20 minutes waiting on the carousel.

I was pleasantly surprised that they maintained their pace for so long. The food was certainly better than most economy fare and the in-flight entertainment provided more than enough options to keep me occupied for nearly 40 hours of flight time on my round trip.

2014-04-19,Lufthansa customer review,6,FRA-SIN-FRA on A380 in economy. Flight was cheap left/arrived on time and meals were fine but those were the only real positives. Fortunate to snag a seat with no seat in front so endless legroom. All other seats in economy looked ridiculously cramped. Seat itself was extremely uncomfortable for the 12 hour flight and the constant prodding of the touch screen from the passenger behind is a little annoying. (Unfortunately this is the only way to operate the screen as the remote is basically useless) Entertainment system would have been ok but crashed 3 times. Am Lufthansa 'Senator' status which helped in being able to secure one of the best seats (53D) other than that absolutely no recognition of so called status on board unlike Air New Zealand where one feels welcome pampered and valued - even though it is not my 'home' airline.

2014-04-19,Lufthansa customer review,8,Madrid to Bogota via Frankfurt. Excellent flight to FRA with good hot breakfast of Spanish omelette and spinach bread and jam with plenty of drinks! Upgraded to business class with my partner using miles. Only issue I have with Lufthansa was the transfer to Terminal C which includes having to exit and go through security once again which is always slow at FRA airport. Senator lounge in C very nice and cosy with direct door access to the gates. Service onboard to Bogota was excellent despite my food choice not being available even third row into the business class. The food portions are smaller but the drinks service made up for that with the crew members being super nice and efficient. I have always enjoyed Lufthansa since 15 years in general but the new miles and status earning system is somewhat disappointing but perhaps necessary with the overcrowded lounges and lack of free seats when using miles.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,148,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-04-24,Lufthansa customer review,8,I flew flight 434 from Munich to Chicago (ORD) on their A340. The plane was new beautiful and the flight attendants were pleasant. I had the chicken with rice meal option and it was good. I enjoyed the white wine and the staff was very good about keeping the passengers' glasses filled with water juice or soft drinks. I had the calzone instead of the quiche for the snack prior to landing. It was only okay and I was disappointed that a fork and a knife were not offered with this option. The IFE (in-flight entertainment) options were adequate. During the flight I watched two movies and enjoyed the spa/relaxing music option. To summarize I had a good experience and believe I got good value for my money. I would recommend Lufthansa.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,155,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-25,Lufthansa customer review,7,FRA-BCN 22 April Economy award ticket. This was an expensive (paying with miles) ticket from LJU to BCN. The first flight was on Adria and its new CRJ900 aircraft. FRA-BCN was on LH economy departure 4 mins before time bearding with 2 jetways to A321 which is very rare. Cabin crew were just regular. No special attention towards top tiers full flight basic food which included a small sandwich and a drink. Well groomed staff and maintained aircraft. Arrived (touched down) in BCN 6 mins ahead of schedule but lost 20 mins due to taxi and outside parking position even if a lot of gates were empty. Lufthansa is keeping itself above water saving even where savings are impossible charging more for taxes and lowering earning levels of Miles & More. After 25 years and complete dedication to LH I will not re-qualify for Gold status anymore.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,156,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-28,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 415 IAD-MUC on April 21 2014. This flight offered the cabin service as it used to be with friendly and attentive flight attendants which created a nice relaxing atmosphere. The inflight system was new and worked very well especially when comparing to the e.g. A380 (eco) which are terrible. Flight was very good however it all depends on the crew. I also experienced very bad and disinterested service (lately LH 462 A380 FRA-MIA on April 13 with unclean toilets right from the start and stressed personnel).,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,157,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-29,Lufthansa customer review,4,FRA-SFO LH454 13 Apr 2014. LAX-FRA LH457 25 Apr 2014. First class flight inbound: Seat was broken. System needed to get re-started 4 times during the flight then adjusted manually. Food: salad was unenjoyable. Main course (beef fillet) looked very good but was tasteless. Service onboard not first class at all. Slow and not attentive. Lounge LAX: great facilities. However very thin food offering. Business flight outbound: Entertainment system crashed 3 times. Old business class seats.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,158,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-30,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH456 and LH9242 on 10 April. Good product and Service - Shared flight with United Airlines was awful (not a thing I was looking for as I booked Lufthansa). Employees were most of the times quite nice. In-Seat-Entertainment in 747-800 works horribly (touch screen). Planes are cleaner than others from other airlines but still somewhat dirty - cleaning should do a better job and crew must check it prior to boarding.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,159,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-01,Lufthansa customer review,7,IAD-FRA LH 419 20/4/2014. New 747-8 reduction of engine noise - good. Seating - in view of economy class - good. Meals - breakfast lousy. Cabin crew - morning service started late no prompt to bring the seat back into an upright position for meals. Reaction time of inflight entertainment system very slow.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,160,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-01,Lufthansa customer review,4,Very positive experience. Only one major complaint: the distance between the rows of seats is very short. I am only 175 cm tall and weigh 65 kg but feel cramped in when the seat in front me is being reclined back I have no choice other than also tilt my seat back - even if I don't want to. Most other airlines provide better seating arrangements than I experienced on the flight LH 476 on April 28 2014.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,161,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-05-03,Lufthansa customer review,6,May 2nd 2014 LH 413. Excellent cabin service. However I was unlucky in getting one of those ancient First Class cabins with seats which should be in a museum. I think it is unacceptable to offer such a First Class product when many Business class seats of other airlines are way better. The usual new FC is good though but the old one must be replaced.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,163,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-03,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew MAN-FRA-BOG round trip last week. Overall was I was impressed with Lufthansa and would fly with them again. IFE is good if a little dated. FA's are very professional courteous and friendly. They were helpful with every request that I or other pax around me had. The aircraft (B737 A346 and A320) were clean. I opted for the vegetarian meals and was impressed with taste and quality. My only gripe is the seat pitch in economy. Thankfully I had a spare seat next to me on FRA-BOG outbound otherwise it does feel a bit cramped for a 180cm person like myself. I would travel with Lufthansa again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,164,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-03,Lufthansa customer review,10,ABZ-FRA-TXL on 737-500 and A320. Lufthansa clearly stands out on European routes for me. 1) All classes include checked luggage and they are generous when it comes to weight limits (I had 28 kg no problem whatsoever). 2) Very generous bar service even between FRA and TXL (50 min flight time) they served drinks twice. There is always a snack and on international routes a proper sandwich which makes a difference with for example BA or Air France where they still serve lousy crackers on international (European) services. 3) The cabin crew are lovely has humour and also treats Economy Customers as important guests.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,165,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,8,Went First Class FRA-MIA on the A380 21st April. Excellent service on all levels. Comfortable seats low cabin noise - very pleasant trip. Went Washington - FRA on 26th on the new 747-800. A not so pleasant flight. It took two hours to get the inflight entertainment system to restart but service was good otherwise and the same type of seat in the A380. My preference although is the 747-400 with the first Class on the upper deck - much more space and more quiet.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,166,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,9,Several flights in April: Rome via Munich to Sao Paulo and back from Rio de Janeiro via Frankfurt to Nice. All Lufthansa operated. Consistent quality on all flights: All on time (some ahead of schedule) very professional and courteous employees on board. I don't understand why their cabin crews have a reputation of being cold and robotic. Not true at all. Very service orientated. Seats improved on long haul flights. I liked the new inflight touch screens like an ipad - easy to use large and better variety of movies. Food as always very good departing from Germany and only average from Rio. But beverage service (also alcoholic) excellent nice snacks like Milka chocolate bars in the galleys throughout the flight. Airbus A340-600 much quieter and nicer to fly than even refurbished 747-400 back from Rio. Munich airport simply great to transfer. Frankfurt new Z-area a great plus. Baggage handling despite short connexion time good. Always arrived with us. A great way to fly very recommended!,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,167,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,7,YYZ-FRA-TLV on April 30. YYZ-FRA leg operated by an older 747-400 instead of the usual A340-600. Aircraft was refurbished and offered personal touch screens; seats were rather thin and uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. I ordered a vegan (VGML) meal which included steamed vegetables and plain rice food was ok but lacked proteins and flavour dairy granola bar and margarine were provided which was annoying. Free beer wine and spirits were offered. Staff were courteous and professional. FRA-TLV leg was in a high density A321 seats were about 2 inches thick very hard and uncomfortable for the 4 hour flight. Food was surprisingly good and much better than the YYZ- FRA leg. No entertainment was offered. Service was extremely professional and courteous. Overall pretty satisfied and will definitely fly again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,168,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Lufthansa had a Boeing 747 for this flight and it was great with individual TVâs for movie watching. Air hostesses had great attitudes and served with a smile. It was refreshing to see a good service throughout and made the long flight bearable. Only suggestion I would make is to provide more and better choices for movies.

2014-05-07,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH456 on May 4. This was a standard Trip on Lufthansa's Boeing 747-8i and the exit row window seats in economy are almost perfect for a daytime intercontinental flight. The entertainment systems performance was a little sluggish first but recovered the longer I used it. Food was OK for Economy service was as you expect from Lufthansa. As a premium customer you get individually greeted here and they even offered to bring a round of premium drinks from the Business class selection. The only pain point was that one of the lavatories was broken so the lines were bothersome all the time. I wonder why such a Premium plane does not get fixed before heading from FRA to LAX.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,176,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Unfortunately we were not notified of the pilots strike until Wednesday afternoon April 2nd. We went to the SFO airport on April 2nd and were unable to obtain alternate flights that day. After several hours Lufthansa scheduled us to go through Seoul Hong Kong and on to Addis. However in the arrangement the last leg of our return flight on May 3rd had been deleted from the Lufthansa reservation list. The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles. That flight left and arrived on time. Then we found we had no reservation from LAX to FAT. It was not a good experience!

2014-05-16,Lufthansa customer review,1,A330 FRA-IAD business class. LH's business class product on this aircraft is unacceptable. I never thought I'd say United beats them in every respect - but on this flight they did. Angle-flat uncomfortable seat. Ridiculously clunky AVOD with poor selection. Food - geez. Bite size piece of veal. No easily accessible headphone jack? Seat barely worked - had to wiggle the switches back and forth many different ways to get the seat to recline. A failed experience in every respect. I had a fully flexible C class fare booked on UAL and to get home two hours earlier switched to this flight. While it was nice to see the family 2 hours earlier I was astonished at how poor this product is. I hope (and am sure) that the 747-8 and other newer airplanes are better - this thing needs to be retired.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,191,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The seat was very uncomfortable and even if I am only of average height there was not even enough space to cross or uncross my legs. I could not move around at all. Unfortunately catching some sleep under these conditions was not possible at all which is really bad for an overnight flight from Boston to Munich. Also the restroom was in really bad condition (thanks to fellow travelers who obviously do not know the basic rules of etiquette) I liked the touch screen of the inflight entertainment system which responded really well and delivered really good picture quality and the staff was really friendly as always.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,193,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Food quality is good but could still be improved. One point I would like to critique is that the drinks menu promises a choice of champagne but usually there is only one of the choices on board. While I was never dissatisfied with the champagne that was offered it annoys me to be offered a choice only to hear that there really is no choice. Another points I would like to make is about the inflight entertainment system. First off I have to say that it has improved tremendously on the content side. Sadly there is still no improvement on the user input side which is very unresponsive and on the design of the ""Lufthansa Media World"" is still confusing and overly complex.

Skipped past a very long queue. 2 luggage of 23 kg checked-in was a nice touch. ABZ-FRA was full good service by the crew with snack and beverage. Not plenty for 2 hrs flight though. Access to Business Lounge is a nice way to spend 2.5 hrs transit with food and plenty to drink as well as shower! FRA-BKK flight was not full and managed to get 2 seats free so get some living spaces for the next 11 hrs. Great crew with smile and helpful. The only downsides are the too hard thin seat for long haul flight and poor selection of entertainment. Departure flight's aircon was set to too warm made it quite hard to get to sleep but it was a one-off fault. Return flights great. Food is more than average. Quite pleased with it.

Mine was a long intercontinental flight with total of 19 hrs flights. The seats are congested and old. Poor quality entertainment system one of headphone speakers not working replaced with another one with without much difference. My 2nd flight was delayed almost 70 mins.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,204,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-21,Lufthansa customer review,9,I notice a lot of improvement at Lufthansa as they want to reach 5 star status. Hong Kong - Frankfurt boarding well organized. New Boeing 747-800 good Economy seats and improved inflight entertainment selection. Even a menu card in Economy Class. Food was really good for this service class. First a dinner with Asian or European selection and before landing hot breakfast. They should improve the presentation of the hot dish (tray and extras are fine) and serve warm bread these are always cold and hard. Beverage selection extraordinary. Staff very professional friendly efficient and helped mothers with their kids. I think it's an excellent airline when travelling with a child. There should be more lavatories in Economy class. No amenity kit. Blankets and specially pillows of high quality with real feathers. Plane change to Madrid in Frankfurt: Arrival in the new terminal aera Z hassle free and smooth. Plane to Madrid full. Another hot breakfast was served. Crew very charming and attentive again. No entertainment system - but's that's okay for short flights. Moving map should be introduced. Swiss has it on board even on intra Eruopean routes. In all great experience professional punctual and I felt very safe. But they have to work on the details for the 5 stars: presentation of hot meals hot bread amenity kit better arrival service in Frankfurt for passengers that don't know this giant airport. And entertainment system on short flights.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,205,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-23,Lufthansa customer review,7,Aircraft was clean and up to date. Lufthansa service was good as usual. There was a new entertainment system available that was more user friendly than the old one and provided more choice. The problem with the entertainment system were the headphones: the volume could not be adjusted so that all dialogues in movies were understandable.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,206,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-05-25,Lufthansa customer review,6,I travelled between FRA and JNB on the A380. Like most I was disappointed that this state-of-the-art aircraft was not equipped with the lie-flat bed even though the website indicated that these flights would have them. Regardless I was able to find some level of comfort (eventually) on the angled beds - one has to play around with it until you find that comfort spot! Service overall was good and efficient and the food was fine as far as airline food goes. Nothing fantastic but then again nothing too bad.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,209,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-25,Lufthansa customer review,9,Johannesburg-Frankfurt. Excellent flight albeit economy on A380 and there was ample space for stowing hand luggage. Staff efficient and very friendly to start off a drink and some pretzels then dinner service (chicken or pasta) with drinks again coffee and liquor breakfast included scrambled eggs.

2014-05-26,Lufthansa customer review,1,"Flew Business Class - Frankfurt-Shanghai and Shanghai-Munich. This is not Business Class at all. The inclined flat beds are hard and it is not possible to lie on the side due to the curve of the leg rest. The food was at best ""better tourist class"" lukewarm and without any finesse at all. With the exception of a New Zealand white the wines were simply lousy. Very little selection. Will never fly Lufthansa Business Class Again.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,212,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-28,Lufthansa customer review,9,I had the pleasure to travel on new B747-8i from Frankfurt to Washington Dulles and back to Munich on Airbus - both equipped with the new seats. There's a big difference to the old ones! The seat is stylish and completely flat. Inflight movie selection is great now as well as the earphones. What I like most about Lufthansa is their efficient consistent and very friendly service onboard. The food was like a restaurant. Wine selection fine but could be better and wider. Unfortunately they don't offer cappuccino or espresso. Business lounges are a great plus. Staff at US airports should be trained to be friendlier.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,213,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-28,Lufthansa customer review,10,Good hospitality and food. Landing and take-off were smooth. Air-hostesses / Stewards were friendly and attentive - a welcoming smile goes a long way during a long haul trip . Was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to Business Class on my connection from Frankfurt to Chennai. Needless to say the long tiring 9 hour flight was reduced to a very enjoyable one due to the excellent service in Business class.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,214,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Good cabin ambience and nice new seating with variable firmness option. Area for feet when fully reclined relatively narrow but seat length good for tall person.

2014-05-29,Lufthansa customer review,6,MUC-EWR economy was a great flight on a 340-600. But the return leg from YUL-FRA was a disappointment. Old 340-300 no USB chargers a terrible screen late departure and arrival without explanation and dinner was served by only 2 teams for the entire economy class one by aisle which means that we in the back (row 42 of 27 or so) got ours an hour after they began. This also meant on a 7 hour flight that there was little time between dinner and breakfast. In flight entertainment is pretty poor - 3 weeks between the flights and they were still showing the same episodes of TV shows. Food was nothing special especially the breakfast was an overly sweet muesli bar a muffin and some fruit. So a mixed bag. The crew was ok though.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,217,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-29,Lufthansa customer review,8,Rio to Barcelona via FRA. Had already travelled 17 hours from NZ before taking Lufthansa but crew were warm efficient. Could see I was looking fatigued even on departure and crew got everyone fed and watered soon after 10pm take off. In first row of economy on 744 which meant no one could recline into my face! Seat ok and legroom in first row restricted by bulkhead. IFE didn't work in my row but not fussed as tired (purser handed out 25 euro voucher to use on return to Rio. Appreciated). Teriyaki chicken a strange choice out of Rio (impression coloured by horrible experience of teriyaki chicken on Hawaiian) but tasted better than looked. Campari enjoyed as aperitivo and Baileys as digestivo. Previous LH experiences have been lacklustre but felt the crew were personable and not the usual robots. All in all v satisfied. LH is a reliable airline offering great service and fair prices. Look forward to return flight to Rio this weekend but bound to be full of football fans pre World Cup!,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,218,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-05-29,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew VNO-FRA-CPH on 25/5/14 in Economy Class. On the VNO-FRA sector they served a surprisingly good and filling breakfast I hadn't expected anything at all. FRA-CPH sector staff served a pudding and they came around with drinks twice on this 1:15 flight. Staff were very welcoming. Seats could be softer but still there was plenty of legroom. Frankfurt airport itself is very boring but at least Lufthansa provides free coffee/tea and newspapers in the transit area. Will fly LH Again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,220,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-02,Lufthansa customer review,9,I flew on May 26th 2014 with LH 415 from Washington Dulles to Munich.

2014-06-02,Lufthansa customer review,8,May 26 2014 LH 431. Good service and food. Nice inflight entertainment with seatback video screens. Not overly impressed with frequent flyer program - having to pay more in taxes for free flights than with other airlines. The seats on this flight had adequate legroom but were narrower and lacked the softness of older aircraft's.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,222,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-02,Lufthansa customer review,1,Flew yesterday from Munich to LAX. Seats arranged in bulkhead 8 months ago only to find agent and Seatguru were wrong (6ft long legged female). We kept getting delivered special meals which we hadn't ordered nearing identical each time which were just as bad as the regular meals zero air-con in our section very grumpy attendants many people in our section asked about the air-con but nothing was done. If you stood near the galleys to get some air you were greeted with nasty attendants wanting to know why were we up.

2014-06-02,Lufthansa customer review,4,LH458 MUC to SFO A340-600. Business class without the new seats actually a rather inferior product and the new seating needs to be much better. Mediocre food with a veal dish for the first meal that consisted of two bites of dry overcooked meat. The meal before landing consisted of curry wurst and a small salad. Really German food is great but curry wurst as the featured food on a $5000 round-trip ticket? Service was sufficiently warm and efficient. In sum Lufthansa will reliably get you from point to point (as long as the pilots are not on strike) but it's really an inferior product (a recent Delta business class flight from ATL to Madrid was far superior in every way e.g. food comfort service).,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,225,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-06-04,Lufthansa customer review,9,I had my last flight with Lufthansa on LH430 from Frankfurt/Germany to Chicago on 05/31/14. We had a new 747-800 which was really nice! Also came with some reasonable space for the legs in Economy (I am 189cm tall) however all the seats in new airplanes today look good but completely lack lumber support. Very good and friendly service! Good food and no additional charges did apply for a glass of wine! Keep that up Lufthansa! Also very clean and friendly looking airplane. And finally many choices for the entertainment program (movies) - very good! However I will never understand why Lufthansa does not enable the program once passengers are boarding and leaves it running until at the arrival gate.

2014-06-04,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flying with Lufthansa is always a positive experience to me: reliable punctual efficient. I recently flew from Frankfurt to Los Angeles flight 450 Economy class and on my return flight LH 453 from Los Angeles to Munich I was able to upgrade to Business class by using my Miles and More account. Compared to the Economy class the Business class seats are very comfortable allowing to stretch completely and have a nice rest so that the flight time seems to be much shorter. Also the connecting flights to Verona Italy with Air Dolomiti were perfectly on time. I only wish that the fares to fly in Business class were not so pricy i.e. more affordable then I would book all my travels with Lufthansa in Business class.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,231,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-06-05,Lufthansa customer review,10,I was lucky to receive a complementary upgrade to business Class for my flight FRA-LAX. As usual in Lufthansa Business Class the service was excellent personnel always polite and attentive. The inflight entertainment was of best quality in terms of hardware but fell behind competitors in breadth of offering where eg Singapore even in economy has at least 5 times the amount. Lufthansa's service is more conservative than eg Virgin which suits my personal tastes more. I paid for a flexible economy class ticket for the trip FRA-LAX returning JFK-FRA which was in my view expensive but LH was the only carrier able to offer non-stop on both legs - so LH scores again over competitors in this case on global reach. In the past I have been a regular international flyer with LH having had Senator status for at least 10 yr. However this has lapsed and I have recently been travelling mostly as an economy passenger. Accordingly I cannot accurately compare the current standard of LH business with many other competitors with the exception of Singapore and Emirates who unfortunately offer better seat comfort and entertainment. The aircraft on LH450 was a 747-8 which offered less seat breadth in the reclining position than the A380s of Singapore and Emirates.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,233,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The desk attendants refused to help us in any other way.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,249,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-18,Lufthansa customer review,2,I connected to LH at Frankfurt from a United flight originating at SFO. The arrival and departure at FRA both involved aircraft parked on remote pads and being ferried on stuffed buses to the terminal buildings where insufficient gate space apparently exists. As I was about to get stuffed onto a bus an imperious LH gate agent demanded I surrender the bag in which I carry my CPAP machine. She couldn't have cared less that I was told to keep close hold on it on all my travels and other airport staff have no problem treating it as carry-on. Furthermore there was plenty of bin and underseat space on the flight. Other than that nastiness the flight itself was fine and LH probably deserves its 4-star rating excepting for transfers at FRA.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,250,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-18,Lufthansa customer review,3,LH418 8 June FRA-IAD. I am very disappointed by the new flagship of Lufthansa or to be more precise of its Economy Class cabin. While the cabin itself is very comfortable from an environmental point of view - pressure humidity and noise - Lufthansa simply put uncomfortable seats into the great fuselage. They are too hard and there is not enough leg room. Even for an average 1.83m 79kg male sitting in these seats is a pain. The food is just below anything. One does not even need to compare it to the far better airline meals of Air Canada to come to this conclusion. Privileges for Lufthansa status customers are a joke. The Senator lounge in Dulles is more like a shoe box. Only the staff is making the difference as usual. Great staff on board and on ground is the single reason besides the direct connections why I still fly Lufthansa.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,251,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-18,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH451 on 11 June from LAX to FRA. As usual Lufthansa's service - staff food and entertainment - was excellent though it was a bit tough to get the touch screen to react. The economy seats on the new 747-800 however leave something to be desired. While the legroom is alright the seat is very narrow doesn't recline very much not very comfortable on a 10 hour flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,252,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Lots of space entertainment system finally up to date with hi-res displays good selection etc. However lots and I mean lots of restroom traffic. LH went cheap and only installed 2 restrooms for middle section of eco class to cram in 2 more rows (however more legroom on this new plane). Ridiculous and therefor many people waiting in line in front of and around your seat at all times. I always bring my own food since LH and most airplane food in economy is inedible so can't comment on food.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,254,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

My seat on flight 464 from Frankfurt to Orlando was 39c. I checked in online double checked at the Frankfurt gate still 39 c. Once onboard my seat was given to another who booked late. The new seat was in another section of the plane nowhere near my husband. Since the flight was full the attendants would not move this passenger and were unhelpful.

2014-06-25,Lufthansa customer review,1,I am German and used to be a loyal Lufthansa customer. In general it is probably still one of the better Airlines out there but the way they treat the average customer who are just Frequent Traveler status or even less and not Senator or Hon is just plain deplorable. The way they credit now for miles flown tells me that they don't value my business at all anymore. Another annoying thing is the discrimination against carry on bag travelers who are not Gold level. I invested quite some money into a carry on to make sure that it would be in compliance size wise according to international standards and IATA approval but yet I was forced at various occasions to give it up when I was just about to board the flight. The most recent very bad experience I had was when I was just coming off the transatlantic flight from Dulles to Frankfurt and wanted to connect on the domestic flight to Berlin LH 180 on Sunday June 1st at 10.45am. The gate agent ladies serving the desk for that flight were just horrible to say the least forcing me to check my carry on bag  which I had no problem carrying on the transatlantic flight from Dulles to Frankfurt. It's one thing if there are viable reasons for that to do so but being singled out while others were walking by with two pieces of luggage was an experience of discrimination that I never wish to endure again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,260,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Passenger handling at the airport was superb pick-up from aircraft escort to lounge passport formalities all done while we relax. The First Cabin was fully booked and we had two stewards taking care plus the cabin chief checking in occasionally. Aside from the splendid service like in a gourmet restaurant our crew was very cordial and made sure our time was as enjoyable as possible. The only downside I can remember is that the air-conditioning was quite draughty and could not be reduced.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,264,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-01,Lufthansa customer review,8,Lufthansa has an excellent first class product. The seat and bed comfort is excellent. Caviar is still served but the portions tend to get smaller than before. The wine selection is always interesting. Food is good but the offer in the first class lounge in LAX not up to European first class standard. In the on board entertainment you might not find the latest films but it's a good cross selection. The atmosphere and color scheme of the newly designed cabin is very pleasant. Bathrooms are bigger on the 380 than on the 747. The content of the amenity bag is rather disappointing. Selection of reading material is good although I would prefer some travel or culinary magazines. The friendly staff will generally address you by name.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,265,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-01,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH415 IAD-MUC 3 June 2014. It was easy to upgrade last minute. In business class it was a very comfortable flight overseas. The aircraft was clean staff were very friendly and perfectly reserved at the same time space was sufficient with having one of the new seats which can be moved almost completely horizontal and the food and beverages were fine as well. LH is definitely my preferred airline between Europe and America.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,266,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-03,Lufthansa customer review,9,Vancouver-Munich-Geneva (4 June 2014) and return (16 June 2014). Flights on time; luggage delivered promptly; cheerful and hard-working FAs throughout making several juice and water runs on the long-haul flights. YVR-MUC and return: A330-300 with 2+4+2 seat layout. Two proper meals served the usual chicken or stuffed pasta as the mains (and for overnight flight YVR-MUC an omelette as the second meal). The main problem with A330 and A340 aircraft generally is poor seat design in economy. Window seats leave a 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage wasting space and very uncomfortable for anyone trying to lean against the fuselage to sleep. The two outboard seats (window plus aisle) are supported by two central stanchions that rob passengers of foot space. No standard carry-on bag will fit under the seats in front and more foot space is taken up by entertainment boxes. YVR-MUC flight had these problems. However MUC-YVR return flight had a new A330 interior with far better seat design: it still left the 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage but the two supporting stanchions were at the very ends of the pair of seats leaving proper foot space and enough room that two full-sized carry-on bags could be placed under the seats in front if desired. AVOD offered a vast array of films music and television programs (even binge-watching programs like the complete first season of the US House of Cards). MUC-GVA and return: E195 with 2+2 layout with seats more comfortable than on an A330. Even a sandwiches-and-drinks service for these one-hour flights. Trip rating would be 8 for the old A330 seating 10 for the new A330 seating.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,267,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-06,Lufthansa customer review,9,MUC-CGN return (twice). I am always happy when I can book Lufthansa (work related) because it is such a reliable and punctual airline. The check-in and boarding is very easy the planes are always clean a little snack and two drinks are provided and I can choose my favourite newspaper. Usually the crew greets with a smile and has a service-orientated attitude.

2014-07-06,Lufthansa customer review,1,"27 June 2014 flight LH454. I flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to San Francisco on an A380 and it is not an experience I would like to repeat. I know flying economy is supposed to be uncomfortable and unpleasant on any airline but adding hundreds of passengers to what most other airplanes carry only compounds the misery. Space tight seats very narrow and food bland as usual for economy. What made this flight ""memorable"" were the long boarding lines and the length of time it took to get off the airplane after an 11 hour flight. I hope the A340 and the A330 airplanes stick around for a long time to come.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,269,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-07-06,Lufthansa customer review,8,I travelled with Lufthansa from Stockholm Arlanda Sweden to Frankfurt Germany on June 23. The aircraft on this service was an Airbus A321. I travelled in Business Class and was seated on 4A. The overall experience is very good and everything is well thought through with German precision. The cabin was very clean and tidy and the service was very good. The food served on this route was a cold dish but very tasteful. If to complain about something the service was not especially well co-ordinated. The meal was served first and it took approximately 10 minutes before any drinks were served. I would have expected the opposite in Business Class. Lufthansa does not offer any IFE on intra-European flights but offers very good inflight magazines. The main negative thing to my opinion is the very uncomfortable seats. Recaro slim fit with very limited comfort. There is no head rest available so bring your cushion or maybe two and the seats are very hard. The seat pitch is however according to industry standards. On this occasion I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt with 1 hour transfer time. The flight was approximately 25 minutes late into Frankfurt but there were no problems with my transfer.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,271,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Only critique was that people tend to congregate around area for bathrooms which isn't a big deal but when they hang out there for more than half an hour and keep bumping into you while you're trying to sleep then it's annoying. Outgoing flight was 747 and seemed to attract more ""standers"" return flight was 330 and shape of cabin did not encourage people to hang around as much. Pleasantly surprised at number of meals and snacks during both flights lots of variety service was great and flight attendants went out of way to accommodate other passengers with young children.

2014-07-13,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 457 3rd July. Overall very good. The available leg space was however below all criticism. For some reason the A-C seats on row 44 on the 747-800 had about 1 decimeter less leg space than the other seats on the same row (and the rest of the plane).

2014-07-15,Lufthansa customer review,2,Flight from Perth to Frankfurt via Singapore. Pleasantly surprised that the Lufthansa A380 flight was more pleasant (happy crew) and comfortable than the code-share Singapore airline flight Perth to Singapore. However the return flight from Toulouse to Perth turned into a nightmare due to thunderstorm causing delays into Frankfurt. The almost total lack of customer care while stranded over night at Frankfurt and a 7 hour wait to re- book (almost 5 hours of which was in a line on foot) was a disgrace. It is the fear of this recurring which means I will be highly unlikely to fly with Lufthansa again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,275,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-15,Lufthansa customer review,6,I prefer Lufthansa whenever possible. But on this flight LH 494 from Munich to Toronto we had the 4 middle seats on row 40 and there was no arm room.

2014-07-15,Lufthansa customer review,1,Vancouver to Munich LH 477 4 July 2014. I found the Food to be sub-standard for a European airline and they also only serve German Wines. The seats are so cramped in Economy Class that it is hard to stretch yourself. They give you warm napkins only on the onward flight and not on return flights. I was carrying my suits so I asked the flight attendant if he could hang my suit in the wardrobe for me and his body language was so obvious that he did not want to oblige my request! Only when I argued with him did he agree to hang my suits. Flight attendants are generally unfriendly they hardly smile and it seems that they are doing the passengers a favor! They generally make a big thing even when your baggage is overweight by 2 or 3 kgs they only allow 23 kgs per passenger in Economy. Compare this to Emirates where you get a generous Baggage allowance of 30 kgs per person on Economy. When I checked at Vancouver Airport for my return flight my baggage was only overweight by 4 kgs but one of the airline staff members was very kind and allowed me to check my Bag in. If not for her I would have had to certainly pay an excess baggage fare!,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,277,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Might be a surly morning but one of the attendants had an unnecessarily rude attitude. Just because I was slow to stand up (and crouch under the low ceiling) to leave the plane he asked me if I was ever going to leave and that other passengers wanted to get out as well. Never has this been a problem on any other airline. He also gave surly remarks to other passengers who didn't perform well enough.

The problem is not with the airline but the travel companions. The only real drawback are the seats which are too narrow in economy to sit in without severe back pain. I avoided the bathrooms. Luckily the flight was only 8.5 hours. What surprised me a bit was the shape of some of the interior knowing that the 747-8 is only around for a short while (carpeting wall sidings). As usual the staff is really top notch and worlds apart from US carriers and - sad to say - AF / KLM or BA.

The purser confirmed that she was aware of the bathroom situation and that she had already two prior flights on the same aircraft that day. During beverage service same purser opened a bottle of sparkling wine mid cabin and showered three rows of guests plus the interior.

2014-07-31,Lufthansa customer review,4,The flight I took 3 days ago (Vancouver-Munich) was one of the most unpleasant flights I have taken of late. I am a vegetarian but eat dairy and yet again I was served the most disgusting food and snacks sorely lacking in flavour and variety. It is always the same and having taken 4 long haul flights with Lufthansa in the last month the meals are predictable and a major let down every time. I take my own food on board depending on allowances at airports but the vegetarian option (lacto-ovo) is lacking dairy and it is very frustrating to see others getting food that makes me even more hungry. Further the seats are very uncomfortable compared to other airlines with leg room appearing to shrink. Flying with other airlines I never suffer back ache but do on Lufthansa flights. I have seen standards drop over the years and find partner/star alliance partners are usually better. The staff were very brisk and unfriendly on the latest flight snatching ear phones from my hands 30 minutes before landing and knocking my friends arms passing in the aisles with carts constantly. The onboard entertainment again is limited compared to other airlines with less choice in both films TV and languages.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,293,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-31,Lufthansa customer review,5,"LH410 on Sunday 20/07. Munich to JFK. The cabin crew are efficient but not especially friendly. Food is awful and always the same: Chicken or pasta (it's a well known joke between people traveling often to and from this destination). Not a fan of the new seats less comfortable than the old ones especially if you are more than 6""2 like me.",Economy Class,1,1,1,N/A,1,no,294,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-08-03,Lufthansa customer review,9,LH 457 24th July. The food is great you'd always want another plate even in Economy. The service and the crews are always friendly and willing to fulfil every need. They did come through the cabin every 20 minutes offering a selection of drinks from a tablet to not disturb the passengers sleeping. Onboard even in Economy nearly every drink is included and so you'll never regret choosing Lufthansa! The only drawback is the inflight entertainment system installed on the A380's and 747-8's the new RAVE system they refit onto the A330/A340 fleet is great but sadly it isn't available upon delivery of the aircraft as manufacturers don't install this system. But though the selection of movies in different languages is great the only bad thing about the system on A380 and 747-8 is the screens are responding extremely slow and they are quite small due to a lot plastic surroundings. And the flight information is insufficient as the system doesn't show altitude speed (ground and air) flight heading wind speed and direction and such stuff. Overall great flights with just this minor drawback.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,295,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-08-03,Lufthansa customer review,8,BOS-MUC on A340-600. Smooth check-in with an exceptionally polite and efficient agent. The cabin was spotless with soothing colours and perfect temperature. The FA's were very attentive and maintained the professionalism and efficient service I am accustomed to from LH. The seats were the old angled business class seats which were comfortable in all positions except for sleeping as one tends to slide off the seat. The in-seat USB power did not work on any of the four seats my travel companions and I were seated in. The AVOD selection was limited and inferior to other transatlantic airlines. The meal service was prompt and the food was tasty. There was a wide range of beverage options with a good wine selection. Flight left and arrived on time. Lufthansa offers a good product with dependable service surprises are rare if any.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,296,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-08-03,Lufthansa customer review,10,I flew from Frankfurt to Washington on July 28 2014. The cabin crew were great and the service was fantastic. I ordered a vegetarian special meal and it was delicious. I was at one of the exit row seats and it was very cold. I talked to the crew about it and they took care of it immediately.

2014-08-03,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew Business Class round-trip LAX -Stockholm Stockholm-SFO. I flew the 747-800 and was really impressed with the new Business. I sat downstairs and had a seat in the middle section where every seat is an aisle. Spacious and comfortable. All flight attendants are gracious - would not say so much that the food was any better than UAL. In fact their little mousse dessert was nothing compared to UAL's Ice Cream sundaes. On Lufthansa they gave us a small tin for the amenity kit. The toilets are well stocked with amenities. Inflight entertainment on the new 747-800 was exceptional. So many choices. The return flight from Munich was delayed due to a broken aircraft. We left about 2.5 hours late from MUC. They offered everyone food vouchers and handled the delay very well. While the old Business Class seating on this A340-600 is not at all as nice as the New BC - it was ok. The crew were exceptionally friendly and very careful to make sure that everyone was taken care of.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,299,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Lots of legroom flat bed to rest wonderful service and good food. If I could change anything: better trays (for food) - this is the only element that I don't think is very comfortable but this isn't a reason to score lower. The LH team was excellent as usual on the flight(s) and it was a wonderful end to being in Europe by having gotten the upgrade into business.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,300,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-08-11,Lufthansa customer review,1,Flew from Munich to Toronto August 7th (over 8 hours) and the audio on our seats (3 middle seats in the very last row of the plane) did not work the entire flight. The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice. It was an extremely uncomfortable and frustrating flight. We had paid the same amount as all the other folks who had working electronics.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,303,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-08-11,Lufthansa customer review,5,Staff on Lufthansa are normally very friendly and professional. Nothing to criticize. The seats in economy are a bit narrow - especially if the guest in front of you reclines the seat. The new onboard entertainment system on flight 477 from Vancouver to Munich is nice - as you have your own high quality touch screen with a standard 3.5 in plug for earphones. So your own (noise cancelling) headphones will work. You also get a USB charger on that. In my case the entertainment system did not contain any movies (probably introduced during service before the flight) and i was not able to watch any for the 11 hr flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,305,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

At check in told we would have to wait on a reserve list. As this was part of a holiday trip and booked months ago I can not see how our booked seats where not available. These were paid for months ago so you now those seats are sold and therefore cannot understand how you can overbook. Latecomers should wait until all sold seats check in and then offer what is left to them not give away other peoples seats. This was LH2510 9 Aug.

2014-08-15,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew London Heathrow (LHR) to Larnaca (LCA) via Munich (MUC) on 22/07/2014 in economy. Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person. Happy to recommend Lufthansa though their check-in arrangements at LHR need serious review. The staff service rating applies to aircraft staff. Their LHR ground handling agent's staff would score a zero.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,310,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Unfortunately this led them to neglecting me to an extend that I had to be after them to get something else to drink that what my wife had asked for. Somehow many of the Lufthansa crews on long distance flights still miss the opportunities to show some kind of friendliness and one still has the feeling that one is sitting in a bus from A to B. The special meal (Asian vegetarian) was tasty and the wine selections was good.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,312,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Don't worry the chicken is fine. What do you want more for your money?

The comfort was more or less unsatisfactory because of the space between the rows the passengers around us and the service. Staff were not very friendly and motivating all additional drinks had to be requested by ourselves and their presence in the cabin was very low. Seemed that they were more interested in talking than working.

2014-08-28,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew the brand new 747-800 on this Washington D.C. to Frankfurt route. Was my first time and was very curious about it. The upper deck business class is very quiet and has a private feel to it. I also like that you have a private storage compartment right below the window like on the upper deck of an A380. Lufthansa has made some innovative design choices. For example in the bathrooms the toilet seat and cover both have a separate handle so that it's easy to lift either up. Such a simple invention yet I've never seen it on other airlines. The new biz class seat is a huge improvement over the old angled-flat seat which is still used on all their other planes. It's a friendly configuration for if you're traveling with a friend the seats are slightly angled towards each other making it easy to converse. In sleep mode the seat is unfortunately not too comfortable especially since the footrest where your feet go is very narrow. The food and service was ok. They had a good selection of wines and the menu had a regional focus focusing on cuisine from the area you're flying from. Love the idea however taste wise it was not outstanding. Overall though a huge improvement from their old business class. I hope they upgrade the rest of their long-haul fleet with these seats.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,323,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-08-28,Lufthansa customer review,2,Although I managed to check-in online with Lufthansa via Avianca given an earlier connecting La Paz to Bogota flight the latter did not let me print boarding passes told to report to the check-in counter. Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system only in La Paz by Lufthansa despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation. The seat was finally changed grudgingly - without apology or even a smile - at the gate to 55G at a part of plane and side I did not like at all.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,326,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-09-01,Lufthansa customer review,10,First Class Service in First Class Cabin. Well there might not be much justification to buy a first class intercontinental flight ticket since a business class flight will be a fraction of cost which may give your controller a hardtack.

The short-haul A320s have zero IFE and only a bare minimum in terms of onboard comfort but the handling and service is flawless. My 19.30 flight from PRG was delayed which would have prevented me from making a tight connection in FRA. Instead baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight which was delayed as well and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380 which is always a treat. The cabin is extremely basic and the AVoD is just average but the service is snappy and organized meals are good crews are friendly.

When I went to Lufthansa desk at the Frankfurt airport the ladies there were more than accommodating trying to offer me as many options as possible to get me to my destination.

It's a mediocre flight from London to Frankfurt however the flight parked at the gate they did not use the finger instead passengers were all expected to get out at the rear of the aircraft and take a bus ride to another part of the airport (this seems to happen a lot with Lufthansa flights from London to Berlin and Dusseldorf too). After an involuntary tour of the airport I battled my way through security customs and immigration to get to the Hanover gate only to find the plane had gone. To my way of thinking this represents ""mis-selling"" as there is no way anyone is ever going to make the advertised connection in 30 minutes (not at Frankfurt anyway). Perhaps Lufthansa regard English passengers as ""under-people"". To add salt to my wounds Lufthansa made no apologies and just bumped me onto the next flight four hours later. I complained again at Frankfurt customer service which was a log wait amongst the flotsam and jetsam but was only offered a â¬10 coffee voucher which I declined as an insult. I can only assume that Lufthansa is now competing with German Wings for the most miserable service. Try and leave a comment on Lufthansa's web page and they actually believe people still use fax machines.",Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,no,336,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Food in Y class as bad as always on European airlines. Seats extremely narrow for such a long haul flight (OK for European or continental flights but for Intercontinental flights not enough space). Service as good as it can get in this class. Beverage OK but below standard compared for many airlines particularly in comparison to Asian or Gulf region carriers. Entertainment system really bad (old films that I can hardly remember from my youth). Seat distribution unclear and not well thought through (eg LH has an initiative for ""doctors on board"" and medics can subscribe to this program however flight attendants do not seem to be aware of this initiative in addition medics obviously are not listed thus unknown and do not get seats easy to be prepared for emergencies. Instead they are often seated in the middle of the rows thus hindering them to quickly react).",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,342,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

They were lively willing to help and didn't mind making small talk with passengers. Like all LH flights even this one was refitted with Recaro seats and ceiling attached TV. Passengers were served muesli bars on first leg and on the second leg yoghurt dip with freshly chopped fruits - this is what disappoints me as LH takes pride in being full service airline. Previously they at least served freshly baked bread rolls and sandwiches. LH should really reconsider on snacks they serve as I believe 120 mins are enough to serve a proper small meal although the crew is saving grace and made several drink rounds.

The snack before landing consisted of WeiÃwurst Pralinen and a LaugenbrÃ¶tchen which was very delicious. I asked for an extra portion which I got without any hesitation. They would have thrown away any leftover food anyway so I thought eating another portion would be better as it was extremely good. The only downside to the flight was that the aircraft engines are quite loud compared to other aircraft's. Also the choice of films could have been better.

2014-11-03,Lufthansa customer review,2,Flight out of Krakow to Munich cancelled due to heavy fog. Lufthansa in Krakow put us up in hotel for night with vouchers for meals. Lufthansa staff at Krakow were great cannot say the same for the staff in Germany! Re-booked next day to Munich one hour layover then home to Chicago. Flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. Thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller. Announcements on plane about other connections but none regarding Chicago. I asked a flight attendant before we landed and she said she knew nothing. We arrived late in Munich So the 2 of us and 3 other passengers missed our connecting flight to Chicago by minutes! No one at gate in Munich to assist us. Finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be re-booked. Re-booked to Frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to Chicago the next day. When we boarded short flight to Frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting! In Munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in Frankfurt. Arriving in Frankfurt we had to go to Service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. He directed us to belt 16 Baggage claim B to get our luggage. We got there no luggage! Talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at A and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. She finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. Frankfurt airport is huge and Lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. Classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The clincher is when we boarded our flight to Chicago the next day we were delayed because a family was detained in immigration! What happened to not being able to hold the plane? Horrible service. Unless Lufthansa is the only airline flying to where I am traveling I am not using them again. No one seemed to know and much less care.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,382,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-11-06,Lufthansa customer review,2,Impossibly thin seat and insufficient legroom and this was a long flight (Philadelphia to Frankfurt). Very poor food even by economy standards. Inflight entertainment system did not work well choice of classical music weighted towards modern composers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew. Lufthansa used to be a good airline but these days it's more like a discounter charging legacy prices. Avoid it if you can.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,383,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-11-06,Lufthansa customer review,9,Very happy with our first class flights. The first class lounge in Munich was very pleasant with the usual high quality food offerings. The food onboard was good when traveling from Boston to Munich on 10/17 and outstanding on the way back - Munich to Boston on 10/26. Service also very good Boston-Munich and absolutely outstanding on the Munich-Boston flight. The flight attendant on the Munich-Boston flight was fast efficient and very pleasant. Entertainment was OK we both care more for recent movies than the latest releases but I understand it's difficult to please everyone. I'd say that the Wi-Fi should be free in first class. The Munich-Prague and Prague-Munich segments in business class were pretty much standard the Munich-Prague flight was quite delayed fortunately for us the Prague-Munich flight was on time. All in all a pleasant experience.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,384,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-11-11,Lufthansa customer review,8,LHR-FRA-JNB in economy. Short flight from London to Frankfurt satisfactory with good snack and drink pleasant attendants. Transfer at Frankfurt seamless to the A380 to Johannesburg - gone are the days of long walks through the lengthy corridors of Frankfurt. Very comfortable seats and service on A380. Cabin crew very responsive and friendly. Food satisfactory. Return was CPT-MUC-LHR. A340-600 from Cape Town - plane not crowded so good service again with satisfactory food and drinks. Attendants served beverages throughout the night. Seats were comfortable all round. Minimal fuss and no problems with delays - all flights on time. Very good long haul flight. Short hop from Munich to London was good as well with breakfast snack served just right for this length. IFE can have more up to date movies and music but small price to sacrifice.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,386,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-11-11,Lufthansa customer review,9,I traveled with my family on LH 768 from FRA to PNQ on 7th November 2014. It was a really good travel experience for us. Very comfortable and convenient too. Seats are comfortable same as any other regular Lufthansa flights. Landing at Pune for Puneites is far better than to Mumbai saving a lot of time in immigration process and travelling from Mumbai to Pune.

Very attentive and skilled. Seating and entertainment not the best still bearable for a short flight but can't imagine these standards for +5 hours.

2014-11-12,Lufthansa customer review,1,Oct 19 LH783 a group of us travelled to France in transit at Frankfurt Airport. Our confirmed seatings were all messed up despite we have booked this in Feb 14. It took us 40 minutes at KLIA Lufthansa counter to sort this out - each couple were seated together but the group had to split up. On our return leg (7 Nov 14) our group confirmed seats were again messed up despite reconfirming the seat 3 days before our departure with Lufthansa Malaysia. The check in counter staff was not helpful nor friendly at CDG airport to help us to reassign our seats so that each couple could sit together but the group was split up again. The return flight (Paris to Frankfurt LH1043) was re-timed later by 20 minutes but we were not informed and the flight arrived late at Frankfurt. So we had to run for our connecting flight to KL. There were no Lufthansa Staff at the gate to provide assistance.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,390,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-11-20,Lufthansa customer review,2,"As LH Senator I have repeatedly booked a seat for my flights and repeatedly the seat reservation was cancelled. The seat booking system is not working at all. Estimate 75% of cases the seat cancellation is performed without any background - it is very disappointing. Flight LH2023 is a classical example of another incomprehensible situation - nearly every day the ""business class"" (which in LH's case is nothing but economy divided by curtain from the rest of the plane) is extended till row 12 making 48 business seats while occupation is 3 - 5 ""business"" passengers. Remaining travellers are squeezed in the back while front section is entirely empty. Another trick is to extend the ""business class"" for 24 hours to row 19 remove all forward seats reservations and then return back to the original configuration. Why they do it is a mystery to me. LH obviously don't like their status customers in the front of the aircraft.",Economy Class,1,1,1,N/A,1,no,392,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-11-20,Lufthansa customer review,9,I have to report an excellent journey JNB-FRA-LCY. New refurbished Business cabin on the A380 is very comfortable and a lovely decent sized pillow on which to sleep. Lie flat seat/bed is good but could be a bit narrow at shoulder level. However I managed 5-6 hrs sleep which is unusual for me on a lon flight. Food delicious especially on my outbound FRA-JNB sector Roast Goose which was perfect! Crew on all sectors were friendly and professional and the transit through FRA was a breeze. I would advise people to choose seats at rear of the 380 upper deck pref. row 26/27 as LH serve their food from the rear moving forward so you'll always have a full menu choice if seated here.

2014-11-20,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew MAN-MUC-DEL return in Business Class. Lounge in MAN is ok - typical regional airport lounge. Warm croissants. Breakfast on flight was ok - had ordered Asian veg. Service good. The long haul was a pleasant surprise. I'm 6ft tall and managed to get zero sleep on a flight to Mumbai from Frankfurt 7 years ago and that was my last flight with LH. The new Business class was a pleasant surprise. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Amenity kit is good. The seats are a huge improvement on the sloping beds. I managed to get a few hours sleep too. If you sit by the window you may find it a bit cramped. I switched to an aisle on the way back and this wasn't so cramped. Will use them again for Delhi especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food I forgive them. Will fly LH again for value and comfort.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,394,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

As it arrived earlier than the scheduled time we were transported to the terminal by a bus. The second leg from Frankfurt to Zurich was delayed by 45 minutes due to an unknown reason. Again we were transported by a bus to the B737. Here is where the entire staff and crew showed their effectiveness. The flight duration was cut short to 40 min from the original 55 min.

2014-11-25,Lufthansa customer review,5,Flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt on AB A380 aircraft clean food OK staff OK. Seat lousy - no legroom and uncomfortable. Armrest on aisle seat would not lower making it hard to leave the seat. Staff didn't know how to fix the problem. In-flight entertainment system next to useless because of unresponsive touch screen and one audio channel not working. Aircraft temperature cold to the point of requiring a jacket be worn at all times. On connecting flight to Berlin Luft. gate staff did not announce gate change in English so confusion resulted among waiting passengers who didn't speak German or missed the change on the electronic screen. Flight from Munich to San Francisco on AB A340 departed late because of baggage handling problem. Aircraft clean but temperature again cold and seat comfort worse than A380. In flight entertainment center barely working because of slow finicky touch screen and static in audio. Food OK not good just OK.

Seat comfort and space are excellent. Inflight movie selection was a bit uninteresting.

However I was very angry that the IFE did not work in my seat. Despite three attempts to reset it. Kaput! Not exactly satisfying when you pay premium $$ for a seat on a long-haul flight. The onboard wifi was also broken. I do have to say though that the purser came to apologize to me and she did a great job in explaining the situation re all the technical difficulties. Was appreciated. The food presentation and choices were excellent despite the flight attendants' initial insistence on speaking German to me even when I repeatedly asked them a question in English.

Those seats are not good. Hard not good for sleeping not 180 degree flat but an inclined S form. Other airlines offer a much better business class for less money and on my next US flight I will definitely choose another airline if I find out that the airplane has the old seats. Lufthansa tickets in business class are generally high priced. so I would expect 180 degree seats.

For the 10 hour flight from Chennai to Frankfurt first 8 hours they serve nothing other then two rounds of juice. Just before landing a small light breakfast. Seats were cramped.

The flight was not completely full but the crew seemed to be strained - maybe due to problems with the entertainment system - so that they only seemed to care for the guest who couldn't use the entertainment. I am used to a much better service provided by Lufthansa - my last flight to NY in September this year for example was one of the best flights I ever experienced - the crew was very attentive the purser introduced herself to me and offered me another seat. They even brought me food from the business class.

GRU-MUC on A346 in Business good food good service seat not that comfortable this time - still some hours of rest. IFE some nice films but very limited selection.

2014-12-18,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH456. Had the opportunity to fly LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles in Economy (normally I fly business). Was impressed by the overall high standard (the new B-747 I guess) and inflight entertainment is top of the tops. Small disappointment in food and beverage: Food: overall quality good chicken run out two rows before us so pasta only choice. In addition I do not understand why proper bread is not served instead of this white thing that resembles bad quality (Germany has good bread) Beverage: fail to understand why you get 2nd rate prosecco / sparkling and wines. Furthermore non-alcoholic beer was not available on flight. That is cost-saving on the wrong level in my opinion.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,412,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The foot rest was very narrow the IFE screen was big but the movie and TV selection was not too big. Food was good and the portions where generous I enjoyed the crepe for breakfast no amenity kit was offered.

2014-12-22,Lufthansa customer review,5,One of the tightest seat pitches I've seen on a long-haul flight (Premium Economy not offered on this route). Cabin constantly too cold. Crew was relaxed and friendly at the beginning but less so at the end. Food a very mixed bag. No sleeping masks or any other give aways. Only upside: Entertainment system of the slightly better version without this clunky old-school remote control but a decent touch screen. On arrival we had a tarmac position (at Munich!) and had to take buses to get to the terminal something that feels odd on a long-haul flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,414,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-12-22,Lufthansa customer review,7,I took a flight from Boston to Munich. As it is quite common with this airline the plane was in impeccable condition and practically new however the space - or lack thereof - in economy class is a bit extreme. I think the German engineers went overboard and squeezed a few too many rows into that bird. My inflight entertainment system worked fine but my wife's next to me didn't. The flight attendant told her 2 or 3 times that she would look into it and reboot the system but then she never did.

New Boeing 747-8 in economy - you get what you paid for I always say - but due to my unpleasant experience below some observations that should be taken into consideration. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and the given space on the 747-8 feels incredibly cramped - Lufthansa's smaller airplanes are controversially far more spacious - I get they want to squeeze in as many passengers on the plane but on a +12 hrs flight you don't want to feel like a sardine in a can!

2014-12-22,Lufthansa customer review,8,Had 2 flights MAN-MUC-RUH on 13th December 2014. First flight was LH-2501 from Manchester to Munich in an Airbus A321. No entertainment screens but this was only a two hour flight so I didn't mind. However the staff service was excellent and I got served a decent sandwich plus coffee and coke. Seats were okay for the short flight. Transferred at Munich Airport which was very neat and clean with a good bus ride from the plane to the terminal. The next flight LH-608 from Munich to Riyadh in an Airbus A330 (five hours) was the real deal! Seats weren't exactly the most comfortable out of all planes I've been on but it was good enough! Entertainment screens were quite unresponsive and not much of my interest but I have my iPod so I didn't mind. Managed to watch 2 episodes of Big Bang Theory and my sister watched Harry Potter (she was really happy that there were 5 Harry Potter movies available on the flight). Again excellent staff service (they smiled a lot for an added bonus) and I was surprised to get a really tasty meal (with Halal meat). Really well done for a non-middle-eastern airline!

In the future I will rather fly with Lufthansa's sister company Swiss Airlines which I personally find of a much better service.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,425,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,10,Flight LH475 from Montreal to Munich on 12/12/2014. A bit delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft from Munich however the delay was almost made up in Munich what allowed me to catch the connecting flight. Appreciate the upgrade to Business Class as Gold Star Alliance member - service great as usual no any problems. Recommend LH for long haul flights - even in the Economy Class the seat is quite comfortable and passenger safety and satisfaction is always of top priority.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,426,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,2,I felt disappointed on my flight back from Toronto to Frankfurt in August. At the check-in counter I paid an extra fee since my bag was heavier but that was no problem. I asked if I could bring another hand-baggage but the answer was no. I felt ripped off when boarding I saw people with 3-4 bags each one when allowed is 1. And moreover I couldn't put my bag over me but 5-10 meters behind me since there was no place where it was supposed to be because a young couple had 2 backpacks 2 bags and 2 sleeping bags. I spent 1000$ dollars and 150$ more for the fee and I had my worst flight because I was so pissed off. And at the airport I had to take the money at the atm paying commissions because the credit card machine didn't work.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,427,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,8,I had the flight Paris-Tirana-Paris via Munich last month. Lufthansa offers very good European product. Both flights arrived on time and Lufthansa provides nice clean aircraft's with very friendly cabin crew. I am very much pleased with the generous leg room in comparison with low cost companies. This is very much appreciated! In terms of the food I have only one comment since Lufthansa gives sandwiches which used to be very tasty. Now they gave us the cheese sandwich which was full of unidentified cream and mayonnaise. It was so stodgy and unpleasant. I hope that the management will make appropriate actions to distribute healthy simple food in the future. Overall Lufthansa is my first choice and it is recommended without hesitation for European routes.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,429,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,4,December 2 2014 from Dulles flight 419. Destination was Frankfurt Germany. Upgraded on the return flight which was Frankfurt to Dulles on Lufthansa 418 on December 13 2014. Lufthansa has always been our preferred carrier but the new seating in economy was on the verge of intolerable. The way the seat attaches to the floor greatly limits what you can carry on there is no foot room. Knee room to the next row is minimal especially if the person in the seat in front leans back. The seats are narrow and not comfortable. They are squeezed together so much that the seat pocket in front of you can barely hold one bottle of water. Food has greatly degraded over the past few years. I feel degraded by being in economy class. It is insulting to pay for such a horribly uncomfortable trip. I felt like baggage being crammed into the baggage hold and that I had no value as a customer. Our return flight was much better as we unhappily upgraded to economy plus but we greatly resented being forced to pay more money just to have a seat that was adequate for an overseas flight.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,432,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,10,Flight LH444 from FRA to ATL booked in ECO because our company travel policy does not allow Business but operational upgrade to C (based on my status as LH-Senastor) because the main cabine was full and C not even 50 % occupied. Plane was equipped with the new business class seats I like them very much. The food was excellent and the wine selection very nice.

2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,7,I like Lufthansa but increasingly flying through Frankfurt is becoming a nightmare. More often than not the plane is parked on the tarmac vs. at a gate and there are inordinate delays as the busses don't leave till they are absolutely full - if you are travelling first or business and have got off first or had priority boarding - it really makes no difference as you end up waiting in the bus. Also the amount of time that it takes to transfer gates during transit and also go through immigration make it easily one of the worse international hubs now.,First Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,434,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-01-11,Lufthansa customer review,9,LH772 FRA-BKK with A340-300 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all for Economy Class you can't do much better than that. LH seats seems to be bigger than in the past a little bit harder but more spacious in length. The inflight entertainment is excellent with touch screen 8' monitor quite good quality. The only complain is that it shows the program of December 2014 even we started the trip on the first 2015. The steward promised to check and answer but he never returned.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,439,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. The C class seat near the window got extra storage on the side and is very convenience. The only problem is the remote control under your arm rest some times you unintentionally hit the remote control and your film stops.

2015-01-11,Lufthansa customer review,9,I flew Venice-Frankfurt-Delhi on December 28. Initial flight was supposed to be a day earlier so I missed my connection in FRA and was put on a Lufthansa flight to Delhi rather than Air India which was nice. VCE-FRA was delayed by 2hours and I only managed to make it because FRA-DEL was also delayed. FRA airport although I was there for less than an hour was an atrocious experience. I had to speed like crazy to make the flight and still had to go through security one more time and they were extremely rude unprofessional and in no way understanding. This is surely not Lufthansa's fault but it did ruin my trip. Flight to Delhi was on their A380 which I adore. Leg room was fair food was decent although they only had vegetarian options. FAs were extremely polite and professional and always asked if we wanted any drinks throughout the flight. My issue was mostly related to IFE which was not what I expected from LH. Overly German focused and pretty dull overall. Regardless I surely would fly them again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,441,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-11,Lufthansa customer review,4,I flew on the new 747-8 that Lufthansa put into service from LAX to Frankfurt. The cabin was clean and the entertainment system functioned flawlessly. I was seated in coach somewhat in the middle section. The service was prompt and pleasant. Although I don't eat airline food the cabin crew completed service and quickly quietly cleaned it up. The aircraft itself was quiet and the lighting system was much more pleasant (L.E.D.) than the standard type. Overall better than many other transatlantic flights I've made.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,442,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,8,Vienna - Frankfurt - Buenos Aires (and back): Web check-in worked fine got my reserved seat in the rear of the B747-8. The feeding flight to Frankfurt was uneventful the small snack was okay I also like that you can have a beer on shorthaul flights. The walk to the departure gate was very long but that's not the fault of LH. Flight left Frankfurt on time but arrived late due to the very long flight time of 14 hours (resulting from bad weather over the Atlantic Ocean). Food was okay but less in quantity. I frankly do not understand why airlines cut costs by reducing the amount (and the quality) of food. At least you get alcoholic beverages. Entertainment is now great with a lot of movies/shows to select. I could also find some rest during this 14 hours flight. Unfortunately flight attendants did not make their rounds with beverages that often. Breakfast was very poor! Lufthansa is a reliable and professional airline they usually get you to your destination on time. But I am not really thrilled flying them.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,443,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,9,This was my return flight from Paris CDG to DOH via FRA in Business Class the flight from CDG to FRA was on an Airbus A321 was comfortable with prompt efficient service all on time though I was troubled that at check in although I explained to the staff that I had fragile glass ornaments but they refused to put a handle with care stickers on my bags. The portion from Frankfurt to Doha was on an Airbus A330 with the new business class which was very nice and excellent service with wonderful meal selection I really liked the Bavarian Goose. Though the connection time was very short just one hour but all our bags made it through which was also very nice.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,444,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,9,Trip from Frankfurt to Dublin in Business Class on A319 (no connecting flight). You get what you expect. The weak point is the seating of NEK as its an Economy Class Seat with the middle-Seat blocked. Seat pitch and space are not luxury the recline is ridiculous and it feels somewhat cheap. There is no IFE and no power socket what was not so important on this 110 minutes flight. Nevertheless I would spend the money again as the rest was really ok.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,445,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,2,I have never felt more like cattle than on our trip FRA-HOUSTON on 1/6. Very crowded cabins with seats too close on the Airbus 380-800. Seats cannot be reserved ahead tried every way possible spent ages on it. Check-in online with actual access to seat map that allows you to chose your seat would make a lot of frequent flyers of all categories much happier. Flight attendants are overwhelmed with issues because of the random automatic system booking. Families are scattered all over the plane. Even after take off there were still people trying to reunite. This mess causes people to try frantically to reserve seats from 3 days before until past the door closures why in the world does Lufthansa want to have their personal overwhelmed with this problem is a mystery they lost my trust.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,447,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-01-19,Lufthansa customer review,7,Sao Paulo-Frankfurt in Premium Economy operated with a packed 748. Flight left late but made it perfectly on time. I always fly this route with Turkish Airlines in Comfort class (Premium Economy) but this time I decided to give Lufthansa and its new product a try. Seat: absolutely adequate and wide enough. There is plenty of room for your legs. It is ok for getting some sleep. I liked the amenity kit distributed. What I really did not like it's the absolute absence of privacy as the Premium Economy seats are actually not separated in any way from regular Economy class. Very good (and upgraded) IFE. The welcome drink despite very basic (juice) is a nice touch. Cabin crew as always with Lufthansa is efficient similing and polite. But let me spend some words on the food: almost inedible. It is actually the same food you would get in Economy class but served in china plates. Portion are getting every time smaller and food is almost tasteless. The price paid was quite high - overall not the best value for money. I'm afraid Lufthansa lost me on this route as I will keep flying Turkish Airlines Comfort class.

2015-01-23,Lufthansa customer review,10,LH 457 1/15/15. My first time in Premium Economy. I will never fly business again. The leg space was great the seat did not incline like in business but still enough to enable me to sleep. The service was ok+ of course not like in business but still very good food and drinks were more than sufficient. I also have to mention the excellent service at the gate. I had been on the waiting list for an upgrade to business which had gone lost though. In premium economy there were only middle seats left which I didn't like. The attendant behind the desk looked into it and found a window seat for me. After some terrible experiences with other airlines (especially British Airways whose economy class has become a joke ever since they decided to divide their aircraft into five (!) different classes) this was an enjoyable experience.,Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,yes,462,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-23,Lufthansa customer review,2,Flew to and from Sao Paulo via Frankfurt. Already written about the disastrous seat reservation system so I won't rant on about this here again. I would say though that it took no fewer than 4 people at Frankfurt to actually resolve our seating issues. In the end only the Flight Manager was able/willing/empowered to deal with it. The crew on all flights were to be fair very good and the food was fine too. Seats however were very uncomfortable on the B747 so I got little if any sleep on the long 11 hour flights. Also the IFE is terrible. I have a very varied and eclectic taste in TV music and film and found little to entertain me. And to top it all off Lufthansa left our bags in Frankfurt en route back to London and can't seem to drag themselves to get them back to us in Southampton until tomorrow even though by their own admission they have now arrived on a later flight.

Check-in friendly and quick. Boarding efficient. On board a very friendly crew. Once I had taken my seat welcome drink was offered to all passengers in this section. Nice amenity kit at every seat. The seat is simply great much more space than in normal Economy big IFE-screen with huge entertainment options. This was one of the drawbacks of flying Lufthansa but they finally improved it. Meal service from a menu 3 main dishes to chose from. Well presented on fine china. Due to departure at midnight service very efficient but never looked stressed. Wanted to give us more time to sleep. The seat is very comfortable good enough to sleep for 6 hours or so. Of course can't compare with their new Business seats which are top notch. During the night staff came around with drinks and snacks. Breakfast could have been better in my opinion. But that's the only negative point. In all Lufthansa is getting a real premium carrier.

Honestly this was the poorest flight over the Atlantic. Absolutely no space to sit a domestic flight usually offers more space. The touchscreens almost were not controllable. You could touch them but they did not react so we could not really enjoy the inflight entertainment. The stewardess tried to help she was nice rebooted the system several times but it did not really work as it was to supposed to. Will never do it again.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,467,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-02-06,Lufthansa customer review,6,The crew on the reviewed flight to the USA was great - very attentive and always friendly which isn't self-evident with regard to Lufthansa. The food was ok but the portion was too small for such a long flight (~11.5 hrs). The seat is very uncomfortable (hard and small cushion) my back and posterior already hurt after sitting there for 2 hours. Nevertheless it was better than a regular seat in Economy Class since I had at least a bit of legroom because I paid extra for an Emergency Exit Seat. I think it is very inappropriate to charge that much money for an Emergency Exit Seat. Overall experience was ok but not great.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,468,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-02-18,Lufthansa customer review,8,Trip FRA-SIN and BKK-FRA on A380/A340 respectively. Friendly crew good service. IFE has improved too. New seats in economy are OK but seem of poor quality as the recline function was already faulty after not a very long-time in service. I always notice that the crew 'vanish' after their routine service.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,473,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-02-18,Lufthansa customer review,9,We flew FRA-SIN-FRA in business class. They have really improved their service offering. Now you get slippers and socks which does make perfect sense when you want to go to the restroom. They serve champagne in champagne glasses and finally serve espresso too. The crew to SIN was very friendly and courteous and took great care of us. On the return it was a little less overwhelming less smiles. IFE in general great more quality than quantity I prefer that. On return flight our screens didn't work and they didn't do much about it apart from suggesting we should sleep. Middle eastern Airlines really made a point and now all the others must follow if they want to stay in business. Advantage goes to LH their crews interact with customers .It's all a bit bland but what you see is what you get.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,474,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-02-24,Lufthansa customer review,6,FRA-BOG-FRA on A340-600. As often with Lufthansa I found the flights satisfactory but not outstanding. Airplane looked new the cabin was in good condition and clean (the bathroom less so at least after a few hours into the flights). Beverages were served several times selection and quality were good. Food was o.k. but nothing to rave about except for the very tasty passion fruit cream for dessert on the flight back and the chocolate in between. I am glad though that again there was a vegetarian option. Service was quite friendly and attentive. For a tall person though the space in Lufthansa's Economy Class is really sub-standard: narrow seats leg room barely alright if the person in front of you has the seat in an upright position but very uncomfortable if that is not the case. My seat neighbor who had a center seat could hardly get out of the row. The space on Avianca's A318 for a domestic flight before that was definitely more generous and did not feel as claustrophobic. The IFE touch- screen did hardly react on both flights. Changing the program was therefore difficult.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,477,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-02-24,Lufthansa customer review,3,LH429. The seat comfort in Economy Class is bad compared to other airlines. Even for people with a normal body height it is not comfortable to sit for 8-9 hours. Sleeping is nearly impossible due to steep position of seat back. Due to excellent reputation of airline I still tend to travel with LH and recommend to friends.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,478,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-03-04,Lufthansa customer review,9,"I choose Lufthansa over other transatlantic carriers because I have and continue to experience excellent service even in the economy class. I do wish however that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a ""premium"" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the ""regular"" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good although the ""snack"" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights. United's service simply doesn't compare with Lufthansa's and their flights are frequently delayed or canceled.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,480,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-04,Lufthansa customer review,8,Had a 10hrs flight from LAX-FRA with this airline and the service at the airport was okay. I did online-check in 24hrs before so I only had to go to the bag drop counter. The line was very long so I had to wait a long time. The funny thing was that the check-in line was much faster. Boarding was fast. The impression I got of the crew was that they were very unfriendly and were very stressed. The seats were comfortable for a long flight. Leg space was okay if the front seat isn't reclined. A plus was the inflight entertainment a large selection of movies music TV shows and games. The food was better than average a choice between two dishes. I had the chicken which was okay for an onboard meal. Breakfast was an omelette with spinach and hash browns a plus is that you have a good choice of beverages and alcoholic drinks. All in all it was a nice flight with average food and stressed stewards. In the past service was much better.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,481,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-03-04,Lufthansa customer review,6,Business class on BCN-FRA-DEL. BCN-FRA flight was decent (same seats as economy nothing to write home about good breakfast warm service) but for some reason was parked halfway down the Rhine valley when it arrived in Frankfurt. Took over 40 minutes to make my connecting flight at literally the other end of the airport. For some reason Frankfurt airport staff thought it necessary for all buses to wait for all passengers to leave the aircraft before staring the long trek to the terminal instead of a bus starting off when full. FRA-DEL flight was on the A380 with the old style angled flat seats. Given that both of Lufthansa's supposedly downmarket brands (Swiss and Austrian) have better long haul business seats Lufthansa has no excuse for continuing with this substandard product. To add to the cost-cutting feel the portions of food served on the flight seemed smaller than those I've gotten in the past on LH. At least the IFE worked fine and has good choice and the staff tried hard to keep the passengers happy. Would recommend flying Lufthansa business only if flying on an aircraft with the new business class.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,488,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-03-09,Lufthansa customer review,9,I flew from Frankfurt to Tokyo and back on am A340-300. Both flights were excellent with good efficient service and responsive in flight entertainment. The wifi (paid service) was excellent and really helped to pass the time during the long 11-12hr flights. One passenger had an eating disorder and for some reason there had a misunderstanding and Lufthansa didn't have a meal for them. I was very impressed how the chief purser went out of her way for the passenger offering him food from business class and at one stage even her own food! The outbound flight was delayed due to a technical malfunction just as we were taxiing to the runway. However was impressed with how Lufthansa handled this. The pilot kept us informed several times and we were only delayed by an additional hour. Overall I highly recommend Lufthansa!,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,490,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-09,Lufthansa customer review,4,As large person (6ft 4in) it is almost impossible to sit in one of the standard economy class seats! I learnt that with the cheaper tickets a seat reservation is no longer possible. So even if you check in online (24 hours prior to the flight) only middle seats are available - absolutely impossible for people like me! I had luck that one person didn't check in so one of the seats with additional leg space was available. The crew supported me in this (the woman at the check-in told me that the seat maybe would be available and I should ask at the gate as I've arrived at the gate they already were informed). So this time leg space was no issue but if you don't like close contact to your neighbors you will not stay in the seat for a long time! You can't sit erect you have to buckle. I've spend more than 50% of the time walking around and chatting with the very friendly crew. For me (not paying an extra charge) this seat was OK. But for my neighbor who paid extra it was annoying - he like me was more walking around than sitting in the insufficient seat!,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,491,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-17,Lufthansa customer review,5,Flew Business Class from Newark to Stockholm and return to JFK both via Frankfurt. Outbound on 747-800. Beautiful plane and has a high tech feel. New Business Class is nice but somewhat cramped - the seats are very narrow and there is really no storage space. The angled seats puts your feet uncomfortably close to your neighbors. Service on board was very professional and attentive. The meal out of Newark was surprisingly good with an excellent fillet mignon but ground service was lacking - boarding was delayed by almost an hour after it was announced for unclear reasons and the lounge was crowded with terrible internet. Connecting flight on A321 - just economy seats for business class price. Nice service but terrible product. Return was supposed to be on United from Frankfurt but flight delayed for 7 hrs due to mechanical so switched to LH400. Again impeccable service but meal as is standard for Lufthansa out of Frankfurt barely edible - tough lamb with weird vegetables. Desert so small one needs a microscope to see it. The breads served were the best part of the meal. The biggest problem is Lufthansa's angled business class seat. The most uncomfortable business class seat in the air. The IFE system had very limited choices. We circled JFK due to a bad snow storm and then waited for gate forever - total delay of 2.5 hrs. but the crew kept everyone informed and were very nice. Bottom line - highly professional service with sub par cabins.,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,492,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-17,Lufthansa customer review,5,HAM-FRA-RIX: I have travelled this sector a couple of times in past few months and service has always been consistent although at times crew can be sour. All the flights were operated on time on standard A321 without AVOD. I am 189 cms tall and find LH seats hard but I somehow fit in cost cutting can be clearly seen. At all flights informative announcement from cabin. Toilets on LH can inconsistent dirty on some segments. On both flights to RIX crew ran out of sandwiches so we had to take leftover croissants. The crew are doing an acceptable job but they need to work on their snack service. This segment is 2 hours and has enough time to serve a decent snack and please also consider vegetarians. Even though I pay for a premium airline I always have to buy a salad or sandwich from the airport to eat inside the aircraft just because sandwiches are either with chicken or eggs. No vegetarian option and one can't even book a meal for long EU flights.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,493,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-17,Lufthansa customer review,3,I traveled from FRA to LAX on a brand new Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i. The plane itself was in great condition with a wide selection of entertainment programmes and friendly staff providing good service. But economy seating was absolutely not acceptable in terms of seat dimensions. I am a pretty average sized male (187cm 90kg) and my shoulder width was wider than the seat. Same goes for my seat neighbour which meant that we had to sit uncomfortably bent and twisted or get personal. The forward distance was so narrow that my face was only 5 inches from the back of the forward seat when it was moved fully backwards. I tried to avoid the whole thing by upgrading to Premium Economy but I learned that a regular Economy ticket was not eligible for an upgrade. Only Eco Flex tickets can be upgraded but they are so expensive that I would go straight to Business Class instead of buying one of them. Overall I am still wondering what all these bonus miles on my account are good for. Conclusion: When I have an alternative on a direct connection next time I will give the competitor a try. Lufthansa's problem aren't overpaid crews but a lack of respect to the needs of passengers.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,494,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Aircraft was spotless and bright and the pullback from the gate was on time. Service by FA's was efficient professional and attentive. Two choices of main course was offered for dinner and the food quality was good for Economy. There were several drink rounds throughout the overnight flight and breakfast was served prior to landing.

On this flight everything was wrong. Boarding was chaotic there was no priority boarding. No invitation.

A couple of hours after I checked-in online the day before I was supposed to travel OSL-FRA- TXL Lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my Lufthansa OSL-FRA sector was cancelled due to Lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. This Lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. Furthermore it was all in vain trying to call Lufthansa's reservations in Norway and elsewhere in Europe - lines were too busy to get through. So despite my very busy schedule I went to Oslo's Gardermoen airport where SAS do the ticketing for Lufthansa. In a very short time SAS rebooked me on the SAS direct morning flight from Oslo to Berlin-Tegel therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by Lufthansa and Lufthansa pilots on strike. I paid extra to fly on Lufthansa as I had to be in Berlin early but in hindsight SAS was cheaper more reliable and better than the competition on this occasion - paying a premium to fly Lufthansa resulted as a waste of money time and effort (given the pilots strike not just SAS but also Norwegian and Ryanair would have been better on this occasion). On the return sectors TXL-FRA-OSL the service was very good and significantly better than I what experienced lately on Lufthansa. However all in all this is was the second time in the space of just 3 months that the industrial disputes between Lufthansa and capricious Lufthansa pilots caused me inconveniences while travelling between Oslo and Berlin. This time the inconveniences were not acceptable to me and as a result similar future travel arrangements will be on other Star Alliance carriers but preferably not Lufthansa.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,512,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-04-16,Lufthansa customer review,9,ARN-MUC-DEL and return from 2 April to 12 April. ARN-MUC and return both operated by A320s MUC-DEL with an A346 and DEL-MUC with a refurbished A333. ARN-MUC departed on-time had checked-in online and we had selected our seats. Everything was as planned our seats did not get mixed up like they usually do on other airlines. Boarding was smooth as expected. The flight was 100% full overheard the flight attendant saying that not a single seat was empty didn't also find an empty seat when I looked around. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive overall the flight was very pleasant. Next flight was MUC-DEL onboard an A346 unfortunately it was a plane with the old IFE and seats but the outstanding service by the friendly flight crew compensated for it. Food was great didn't expect that good food from LH. Legroom was enough for this flight we landed 20 minutes late in Delhi due to thunderstorms in the area. DEL-MUC operated by an A333 with the new cabin very clean plane. It had the new IFE which was very neat looking however I think they need to add more popular albums and more movies. The legroom wasn't great but it was enough for me I'm 177 cm tall. The flight attendants were extremely friendly on this flight as well in fact all of the LH flight attendants were friendly. I don't like to eat breakfast on my flights but the food wasn't bad flight landed exactly on-time in Munich. MUC-ARN once again operated by an A320 flight was on-time with friendly flight attendants again. They served a sandwich on this flight which was not bad. Overall I'm very satisfied with Lufthansa's service very nice flight attendants they also had very helpful ground crew at DEL.

2015-04-16,Lufthansa customer review,3,"4/10/2015 FRA-LAX LH 456. Lufthansa from FRA to LAX on A380 economy class and won't repeat this mistake anytime in the future. Seat pitch is listed as 31"" but felt more like 28"". Width is listed as 17"" and that felt about right. Seat configuration is 3-4-3 which is pretty much standard. It was just too cramped again I believe the pitch that Lufthansa list is wrong as I've never felt so tight with a 31"" pitch and I've recently lost 25 pounds. All else was great. Food was above industry standard staff were polite and attentive after meal drinks were plentiful and included brandy wine and beer at no charge. Snacks were passed out during duration of flight. Flight entertainment was weak but having a place to charge my laptop was handy as well as WiFi although slow and charged at 17euro.

2015-04-19,Lufthansa customer review,1,"I flew with Lufthansa for a connection flight the duration of which was likely no more than 3-4 hours it was a short-haul flight. I needed to freshen up before landing there were no seatbelt signals up so I seized the opportunity to use the lavatory to freshen up. As soon as I finished and exited the lavatory there was a flight attendant waiting for me. I opened the door and this woman was standing in front of the restroom with what seemed like arms folded and a scowling face as though I'd done something wrong. No I wasn't in first class and yes my ""freshening up"" in the lavatory may have taken some time. But at the end of the day I paid for my flight and frankly it is no business of a flight attendant what passengers do in the restroom. She said not one word and basically stared me down as I walked back to my seat. Needless to say the customer service was lacking from the flight staff and I will never fly with Lufthansa again.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,516,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-04-20,Lufthansa customer review,9,MAD-FRA-JFK. Airport experience in FRA was absolutely the worst. However on board product and service is excellent. First leg on the A321 full bar service and tasty hot breakfast was served despite being a short 2-hour flight. Service was excellent and attentive. Second leg on the A380 and sat on a small section of Economy class on the upper deck. There was a dedicated flight attendant for the mini cabin and service felt very personalized and private. He was extremely attentive caring and friendly. Lunch was delicious and substantial and so was the pre- arrival snack. IFE had a good selection of movies TV shows and cool features like the tail camera and the screen was of decent quality and responsive. Seats were comfortable and reclined a lot although under seat storage was extremely limited due to the IFE box.

2015-05-01,Lufthansa customer review,7,Flew SFO-FRA on the A380. 11hr 20min in Y. Boarding at SFO was a mess because of some bad handling of their staff regarding priority boarding of disabled people that were flying with us. On board IFE had a decent selection touchscreen not very responsive though. They served dinner and breakfast in the morning. Honestly both were quite good. Staff were smiling even during breakfast in which they surely looked tired but they kept a professional attitude. They gave us a pillow and a blanket (which were acceptable) and the headset (terrible sadly). During the flight water was distributed frequently and you could also serve yourself in the galley for some snacks or some juice and the staff was gald to help. The recline is not bad at all but the pitch is really lacking sadly. No mood lighting also (which would have been a nice touch). Capt spoke frequently to the cabin also because of some sustained turbulence we had that interrupted breakfast: he assured everything was alright but we were unlucky as some strong tail winds shook us for a good part of an hour on the Atlantic. After we landed it was a mad rush to the connection with Air Dolomiti to Verona: FRA is quite huge and we only had an hour or so. All in all a good experience: I find that atm what sets apart an airline with an another is their staff which I found really helpful kind and respectful.

Cabin crew were very attentive and friendly. The equipment used was 747-8 which was a delight fly on. Good selection of in-flight entertainment and food was also good. I asked for a pack of toothbrush and toothpaste and was given straightaway without questions asked and the lady FA had a friendly smile. Flight back from Buenos Aires was somewhat hit and miss. They were asking passengers for an upgrade for a minimum cost. I spent sometime travelling around South America and was down to my last few dollars so wasn't able to avail their promo. I found out later the they have upgraded quite a few passengers even though some of them were not frequent fliers. I am a Miles and More member and also I have got a frequent flier from SK which belongs to Star Alliance and I earned my points for quite some time now. I felt left out by the upgrade and so I asked one of the staff why the Miles and More members had been left out and my queries were rudely brushed aside telling me that 'You only fly economy'. Some of the FA's on board were friendly enough apart from one female FA with a really bad attitude. When I asked for a pack of toothpaste and toothbrush she immediately told me off they haven't got any and why did I bother to asked because I was in the economy section and then she walked away. When I asked one of her colleagues I was immediately handed a pack. I thought that being a Miles and More membership had gone to waste.

Quick transit in FRA then they decided to change the gate twice. I did receive SMS messages about this and the gate staff were apologetic. The flight to HEL left late as the aircraft was late in from Hamburg. Again good crew. 2 choices of small sandwiches neither I could eat due to some of the ingredients. The stewardess said she would try and find me an alternative and sure enough came back with a chocolate and nut croissant. Unusual for the time of day it was not bad at all and you cannot fault her attempt to find me something I could eat. Going that little bit further shows why LH is one of my favourite airlines.

Despite having flown between Singapore and Europe several times in recent years this was my first experience of the A380 and I was a little in awe of this giant aircraft. It is an excellent airplane! It makes flying seem so effortless. Super smooth take off and landing and so much quieter than a B777. Legroom is the main advantage of P/E. We firmly believe all airplane seats should be this size. I find standard economy now is so cramped as to be almost unbearable on long flights. The premium is well worth paying for and much more affordable than business if you are paying yourself. IFE was superb fast and responsive and an excellent choice of both video and audio channels. Food was good if not remarkable and service was extremely prompt and polite. Getting on and off was fast.

Some flights were with City line subsidiary some with Lufthansa mainline. City line is better in terms of seat comfort (2-2 on Embraer aircraft plus good seat pitch) but no hot meal service. Lufthansa serves hot meal but seating is crowded and provides less comfort. Also City line crews mostly look disinterested. Ticket prices looked excellent value for money. A big letdown was Frankfurt airport experience. Not a single time had we embarkation or disembarkation via finger. Long bus rides only. To add insult to injury when boarding via bus they never used bus gates. We had 5 flights downstairs from Z gates designated for A380 only to stand for 25 minutes on the apron waiting for the bus to pick us up.

Return trip the bathroom was the dirtiest smelliest mess I have encountered on a plane. Is anyone responsible for checking it during the flight? I have very low expectations of food on airplanes but these meals were worst I've ever had. What really has made me decide to never fly Lufthansa again is this: I paid extra to reserve seats in the first row of economy which has a partition in front of you instead of a row of seats and more leg room. When we checked in for our return flight we were told those seats were not available.

The LH lounge at T2 was wonderful, although crowded in early morning. The breakfast spread was fabulous by lounge standards. Staff told me the food is by Do & Co, and hope they can provide food to all LH lounges in future. Onboard service efficient and friendly staff, I like that they still offer you a good choice of magazines even on short flights. A light breakfast served, seats reasonably okay with middle seat empty. In MUC decided to try out the ""paid"" VIP Terminal on way back - wow! It is fabulous and even has its own beer garden and outside dining area. You get taken by car to foot of steps for boarding.

Overhead storage cabins are sufficient unless your fellow passengers are selfish and store too much there. Plenty of leg room even if I store my bags up front (talking about the window seats though). Service quality by the staff (attitude, promptness and helpfulness) was 4 out of 5. As for meals I was highly impressed because of their setting.  Metal cutlery (not plastic), menu to read, delicate desserts, and nice dishware. Other than that, the food is OK, the dinner being good while breakfast was  poor.

2015-07-04,Lufthansa customer review,5,"This was our first time flying Lufthansa. While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats. I'm surprised that Lufthansa would not have designed this section better and that they didn't have a more accurate seat map.",Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,yes,565,,Couple Leisure,Pretoria to Boston via Franfurt,July 2015,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

We can understand this the first time, but the second time it happened we didnât get to choose our food, we felt being treated unfairly, and to us it clearly showed that Lufthansa did not care about attending to customersâ needs and respecting their right of choice. We paid our fares as everyone else! It is not about we really have to have that particular food, itâs about the fact this happened twice in a row and obviously did not respect customers choice.

By the time we came down from the plane at Frankfurt, I happened to look up at a clock in the airport, and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. We walked to the gate, and it was a long walk. An airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area, which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to Berlin. He just said the area downstairs was too crowded, so we cannot go down. He held us up for 10-15 mins. Finally, we were allowed to go down, and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance (as compared to over ten in Heathrow airport). That takes another 10 minutes or so. In the end, we reached our gate 2 mins late, and the plane had left without us. After that, customer service was non-existent. This is no fault of ours. They could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. We were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didn't show up. We tried this for one flight, and I refused to do it again. The next available flight was 5 hours later. But we would have reached Berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to London. I have booked this BA flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in Berlin. Yet we had to miss it.

Connecting in FRA extremely stressful (this airport is now worse than CDG), I had 60 mn to do it. It took 30 mins only to arrive at terminal, due to very very remote parking plus a lot of airplane traffic that stopped our bus. Then a long queue at Immigration, and very remote finger (Z62). Boarding had started when I arrived. Service on upper deck (FRA to KIX) was pleasant but slow, the food was delicious. Brand new flat seats, a bit too narrow, but pleasant anyway.

2015-07-24,Lufthansa customer review,3,"Lufthansa used to be the best European airline, not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not LufthansaÂ´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew. I am afraid Lufthansa is rapidly ceasing to be my first choice. What a shame, when only better information would deal with this problem. The very value for money that I used to appreciate - pay more but get something for it - rapidly slips with such treatment.",Business Class,1,1,1,,1,no,587,,Business,London Heathrow to Tallinn via Frankfurt,July 2015,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-07-25,Lufthansa customer review,2,"On Tuesday 7th of July 2015 we checked in to flight LH1285 to Frankfurt from Athens. When entering the aircraft we noticed that the seats in Business Class were the same as in economy and the legroom was the same. The seats were uncomfortable. Usually when you come into Business Class in an airplane you are greeted with a drink (water, juice or wine), but not on that flight. The stewardess did not pay much attention to us. No english newspapers. We had a little boy with us (8 years old) and when his mother asked for a pillow and blanket, only 2 pillows where found in the whole plane and 2 blankets. We waited a long time until food service started, even economy passengers in back of us got service before us. We were served 20 min later. As I said before the seats were very uncomfortable and as I am not a small man I could not put the tray all the way down because the legroom between the seats was not that much. 7th July 2015, Frankfurt to Keflavik Iceland, flight LH856. The same poor quality seats. We asked for a pillow and a blanket but there was only one blanket and no pillows in the whole plane. The reason we were given was that the plane came in over night and all blankets and pillows were used! The stewardess onboard was very nice and tried to calm me down, the reason she said that the seats werenÂ´t better than this was that the flight was short haul. I fly all over Europe at least 15 times a year and everywhere, the Business Class has better seats.

When boarding started the ground staff did that manually in only one line, without activating the two self service scanners. After 20 min I went to the purser and asked if she can assist me with boarding (First/Sen). She told me the boarding process had already started (sure, I was waiting there) and I can board after queuing in the line. After I asked why the scanners were not activated, she looked confused around and asked some colleagues, who then activated the scanners, which gave me the possibility to board. Unfortunately already a lot of people from Economy had boarded, which caused a delay on the stairs to the two bridges (First/Business and Economy). Overall my worst boarding process flying First with LH. Welcome on board was great, service and food thru the entire flight the same. Great people and a big thank you to the team of LH.

Staff are friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable, and needed to be so, as Lufthansa seem to have a unique way of putting a plane down quite hard onto the runway. My only criticism is with the lack of organisation at the check-in gates, with flights sometimes not being called properly so that passengers mill around not knowing what is going on. This aspect is even worse when things go wrong, as they often do on the trip to and from Salzburg as a result of delays and cancellations due to adverse weather.

Everything in the cabin exuded luxury and precise German engineering. The leather of the seat and the console. The seat movements were effortless. The table slid in and out from the side console without any resistance. It is a quality product. Even the details in the bathroom made it a pleasure to hang out there. Although the cabin has a very open feel, unlike the very private suites on Singapore Airlines or Emirates, there is a side panel that you can lift that creates enough privacy if you so desire it. The catering was superb, as was the service. European professionalism with class. Add to that the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and the drop-off to the plane in a white Porsche, and you get a Top 3 global first class product. If I had to change one thing, it would be the video screen. Itâs far too small for a product like this. It doesnât do justice to the rest of the cabin.

Traveling with young children is stressful for any family, but traveling next to unrelated unsupervised kids is surely most people's idea of hell. After 45 mins of arguing we finally managed to secure two pairs of seats in different sections of the plane, sandwiched between strangers. I know it is the modern way to extract every dollar out of the customer through random taxes and numerous surcharges, but it doesn't make any sense to scatter family members throughout the plane.  Maybe Lufthansa should automatically allocate seats for families with young children or be transparent and honest about hidden costs of securing seats. I'm not sure the current policy is very customer inspired for the family traveller or the individual that could be sittings next to an unsupervised, emotional and tired young child.

2015-09-20,"""new personalised long-haul Business Class""",10,"Together with my wife, I experienced Lufthansaâs new personalised long-haul Business Class service on an A380 flight between Frankfurt and Los Angeles. Lufthansaâs ambition is to become Europeâs first five-star airline and measured by the new C-Class service concept, they will get there. The service was impeccable with the flight attendants competently managing the fine line between attentive and personal helpfulness and care â and well-meant, if imposing suffocation of passengers. Kudos to the cabin staff. The food was the well-tasting and delicious food, best Iâve had on a long-haul flight, wines were excellent too. The cabin was well-appointed, colours pleasant, and lots of space for your carry-on luggage. The IFE programme was impressive (but this has become an industry standard, I guess), including the large screens. The not-quite-so-new fully reclineable (âlie-flatâ) seats have been described by others. Since Iâve been flying on the South American services, which appeared to be the last to receive these ânewâ seats, it was still a new experience for me. Hence a couple of words about the seats: they are certainly not bad. The foot-end is rather narrow â perhaps too narrow for comfort â and I donât really understand the reasoning behind it. Space in general does not seem to be missing. Another minor issue is the compartment under the in-seat entertainment monitor. This is where you find your kit with socks, toiletries etc. In our case, you couldnât close it properly, simply because it seemed to be poorly made (Iâve noticed it on a recent 747-8 flight, too). Flying on the worldâs biggest and heaviest passenger plane and then not being able to shut a compartment box somehow feels silly. But itâs a detail that in no way spoils the general impression and, indeed, five-star experience.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,636,A380,Business,BLL to LAX via FRA,August 2015,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

First Class has eight seats, however, on this flight it was only one other passenger and myself. From the moment I boarded the plane, two flight attendants looked after us for the next 14 hours. The seat has to be the most comfortable on any plane these days. I sat on 2A, which is my favourite. Lufthansa did a really amazing job. The amenity kit might not be as luxurious as on other carriers, but it was good for me. They gave me a Pyjama from van Laack in which I could sleep. The food was superb and I was served several starters. One of the flight attendants offered to prepare another main dish if I didn't like the course I ordered. It was followed by desserts and pralines. The service was very kind and attentive without being intrusive.  IFE was great and had a fairly large selection of movies, tv shows, music and other things. When I was ready to sleep, the flight attendant made the bed on the seat behind me (3A). The bedding was almost as good as a regular one from home. They also put something like a mattress on the seat to make it more comfortable. I asked to be woken up two hours before landing in Buenos Aires and so I was.  On this flight, the purser came around three times to check on me and the other passenger.

Staff really friendly and helpful. In contrast to that however, was the receptionist at the lounge. She was grumpy and unfriendly. The lounge was rather crowded. Food selection was OK and there was a rather vast selection of beverages available which was nice. DUS to FRA is too short for any kind of service for economy class. The hardware is the Lufthansa hardware for short haul flights. Nice and comfy for short flights. Transfer in Frankfurt was unpleasant due to the long walking distance. I went directly to the gate where the boarding procedures were comencing shortly after. I was able to use priority but the procedure seemed very smooth. Shortly after take off menus were distributed, however, only to some of the economy class passenger. Also, there was no choice between food options later on. I know some passenger had a different menu. Crackers and drinks were served. I ordered water and tomato juice, but my juice was forgotten and I was left with only salt and pepper until I had to remind the FA. Approxmately 3hrs after take off dinner was served.  Food was tasty, and the portion itself was comparable to other economy classes. The seat comfort was better than I had expected. The seats recline nicely and there is a decent amount of legroom available. When I wasn't enjoying the new very good entertainment system I was able to catch some good sleep. During flight, the FA served water and juice and there was a self service bar for drinks and crackers in the galley. Shortly before arriving for a technical stop in Kuala Lumpur breakfast was served. Containing of scrambled eggs and potaoes along with the usual items. Most of the passengers left in Kuala Lumpur and the airplane was pretty empty when we were heading to Jakarta. A nice and fresh sandwich and drinks were served on this short trip. Overall I would say a good experience. Not the top level five star experience you get from some carriers, but quite OK.

Sitting there, I expect that there may be a baby or two seated in front of us, but not five (5) as was the case on this flight. As the plane attained altitude the woman in front of us changed her baby's diaper in the seat. The staff softly mentioned to her that changing should be done in the restrooms, and then proceeded to reward her behavior with a multitude of gifts for her two children. The children acted out, screaming and yelling, setting off the other children in the row during the entire flight. They were continually rewarded with extra attention from the flight attendants, while we struggled to get their attention for basic service. Surely five is too many young children too be in one row, making the flight a miserable experience for everyone seated around them. Lufthansa needs to disperse the children on any flight, so they don't constitute a critical mass of misery for all the paying passengers around them.

I was only re-booked on the next-day flight after I called Lufthansa in Germany. My seat was 85A on the upper deck which I prefer because you don't have a lot people walking around in the cabin. Two to three flight attendants took care of us on this 14 hour flight. The seat is comfortable and the footsie issue a lot of people complain about wasn't a big deal for me. The cabin layout is quite nice. However, it's difficult to leave your seat if your neighbour turned the seat fully flat and you happen to sit by the window. Then you have to climb over your neighbour. The food was great, however this flight was one of the last ones which didn't offer Lufthansa's new catering service.

Food was inadequately seasoned, no balance between protein, vegetables and starches, and the salad was a joke (a few scraggly strips of lettuce with no veggies at all). The rolls served were ice-cold. Not a pleasant dining experience. The second item was the discomfort in wearing the headphones for the in-flight entertainment. The plastic earpieces were incredibly uncomfortable and the flimsy pads weren't anywhere near sufficient to reduce the discomfort.

Also, they seem too few, so queues build up after diner and before breakfast and landing, crowding the cabin and making it busy. After a shower and fast breakfast in the business class lounge in FRA on to BCN, normal economy seat, some coffee and bun - nothing special, dozed. Did not mark the WiFi as I do not carry any devices that need to connect, internet connectivity was advertised on the flight - I just need peace and tranquillity, disconnecting is a plus.

We decided on the Thai Royal Orchid lounge as opposed to the United Airlines option. Lounge not too busy, varied choice of food. I had dim sum and spicy soup, sandwiches and a glass of white wine. Sadly there is no champagne in the Thai lounge at HKG nor any choice of wine other than red or white. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the experience and the gate was not too far away. Boarding was orderly, despite the best efforts of some passengers who clearly didn't understand the logistics involved in boarding the A380. We were amongst the first to board and received a warm welcome from the cabin crew and we were addressed by name during the service. Pre-take off drinks were offered including sparkling wine and an amenity kit, slippers and a bottle of water were in the seat pocket. After take off drinks included champagne with a smile and the dinner service was excellent, the scallops and chicken with rice dish was very tasty and the crew were charming. Dinner was rounded off with cheese and port and then coffee and a rather nice Cognac. The seat when fully reclined was comfortable and felt more roomy than the Swiss seat/bed I had on the outbound and I managed to sleep for a few hours undisturbed. The cabin on the A380 was noticeably quiet, maybe because Business class is upstairs. A hearty hot breakfast was served which was tasty and ample. An excellent flight with a stellar crew. Quick disembarkation at FRA and we made our way to the quiet Senator lounge prior to our, not cancelled flight to London City. The flight was very full because many of the mainline flights to Heathrow were cancelled. This short flight was another enjoyable one with a personable crew and a quite filling continental breakfast of cold cuts, cheese, fruit and pastries. The usual bus to the terminal but at least there were the e-gates so not much waiting at immigration and our bags were waiting for us on the carousel.

On my way back, there was a technical glitch with the engine and my flight got delayed by 9 hours. As a result, I missed my connecting flight (With Thai Airways) and was forced to stopover in Bangkok for 10 hours. However, the worst part was the customer service at Frankfurt First Class counter which is where I was directed to, to get further help. It proved to be anything but, helpful. I asked the person at the counter, that due to this delay, now I would not only miss my connections but, also have to stay overnight in Bangkok for 10 hours - how would Lufthansa assist. I was informed that my Contract with Lufthansa ended in Bangkok as my connection was booked separately with Thai Airways and not through Lufthansa.  I had  to go to customer service online or look for Thai Airways staff in Bangkok. When I tried to explain to him that it is basic courtesy that he or someone in Frankfurt office communicates this to their Bangkok office in advance, so I donât have to go looking for their representative at midnight after a long flight, I was informed this is not possible as they had given me an airport hotel voucher in Frankfurt for the delay and had met their obligation and their contract ended the moment I landed in Bangkok. I re-iterated that all I wanted was that they communicate to their team at the other end, so whatever solution they have can be pre-planned, as it was Lufthansa fault. However, it proved too difficult for the counter person to comprehend, and I had to ask for his supervisor, who seemed to understand and agreed to inform their Bangkok team.  I could not comprehend the service standards and I could not escape the feeling that they were doing me a favor.

The flight attendants were very accommodating for us, as we were flying with children. But, unlike some airlines Iâve flown with (ie.

Nice is the small amenity kit with a toothbrush, paste, eyeshade, earplugs and socks. I would say that the seat is the best shot LH took.

He said that restaurants are open whole night there but that wasn't true and only 1 shop was working. On the flight back a flight attendant was rude, another one forgot we asked for tea.

Staff were not particularly apologetic at LCY, just herded people to fill out forms and promised bags will be delivered by next morning, which turned out to be a lie as bags still have not turned up yet the next evening. They outsourced this task to an appalling company that even they can not contact as they never pick the phone up or respond to emails. They also booked us (family of 4) in rows 3, 27 and 28, even though since this was a connecting flight this was done 15 hours before the flight, not a last minute check in.

Also that they could either take the luggage or the passengers.  However, it went from bad to worse as it has been 2 days and my luggage still hasn't arrived. Well, it did - at 1am this morning but was taken away when nobody answered the door. How very selfish of me not cooperating with the courier for being awake at 1am following a long haul flight.

The only other option would be to file an online complaint (they donât take complaints by phone) asking for a waiver of the change fee. I went down that option and now one month later I still have not received any reply from them, seemingly they just have too many complaints.

Nice new airplane with a separate lower floor for the bathrooms, limiting line ups and waiting passengers in the aisles. My only complaint was the seating: The legroom was quite cramped - my knees touched the seat in front of me if I reclined, and I am only 165cm. The padding on the seating was also a bit thin, and I could feel the seam stitching on the seat through my clothing.

I had to catch a connection in Munich and since our flight was delayed, I asked the attendant if she knew when we would now be landing. She glared at me and told me ""I should have listened to the announcement the captain made"" and walked away. To be clear, the announcement was inaudible, which is why I called her over for clarification. I was very polite and (I think) within my rights to ask a flight attendant such a simple question. Most of the attendants were cold and unfriendly, sometimes ignoring passengers.

Addis airport is the usual smoke-filled chaos it has always been. Repeated security checks make your journey through this airport frustrating. Welcome on-board was friendly and helpful. Premium economy seating is directly behind the business class cabin on the A330 (3 rows) with only a small 30cm partition hanging from the ceiling between you and the row behind, which is regular economy. If this is a well thought out marketing tool - I applaud LH, however I would prefer an entirely separate cabin with separate toilets (these became very dirty and did not appear to be attended to by the cabin crew for hours at a time). Some passengers from the economy section tried their luck by moving to a Premium economy seat but were soon informed that there is an âextra chargeâ for that seat. They soon went back to their seats in economy. As this was a night flight with a stop in Jeddah we were offered a substantial snack just after take-off (at about 11:30pm local time) after which I settled in to sleep through the stop in JED if possible. The snack was a hot meal (I chose the vegetarian option) nicely presented on a small tray with chinaware and metal cutlery. A choice of wines was served in glasses and additionally, an amenity pack with all the basics you might need for the flight was provided (including those socks that no one ever, ever uses!). I have heard it said that the PE food service is identical to the economy offer. While I could not see what the passengers behind me were eating, the method of service is very different and you do feel that you are receiving an elevated standard of service. Prior to take off in Jeddah, welcome drinks were served (juice). I settled in for the night after that so missed the meal service and woke only for breakfast, which in itself tells you that the seat is comfortable enough to get a decent nightâs sleep. The adjustable headrest with head support makes all the difference. If I am to offer a tip, take the first row of Premium economy if possible, on the aisle. These seats have extendable leg rests (not just the ones that are fitted to the seat in front of you) and so offer support to your entire leg/calves which makes for a more comfortable journey.

I took a leisurely stroll directly from my arriving flight to the gate (stopping for a little shopping for around 10 minutes) and altogether it took almost an hour to navigate through the airport, the mono-rail, the security checks, the other security checks and then to the gate. That said, when I arrived at the gate, boarding had just been called so the timing was, in fact perfect. I am impressed with the number of people on the ground to assist you with the transit. It seems there are no end of red-jacketed people to see that you go in the right direction. The crew were very welcoming and bright. Before take off a welcome drink of minty orange juice was offered in plastic wine-style glasses. After take off menu cards were distributed and pre-dinner drinks offered. They commenced with the meal service a little while later but had to abandon it due to turbulence. A helpful announcement was made, apologising for the delay. Two choices of main course were offered which were served on china and with metal cutlery. Red or white wine was offered from a full size bottle with water (sparkling or still). I have a little gripe with the way the service is ordered as I have noticed that on every flight a refill of wine is not offered until just before the coffee service. I would like to be offered a second glass of wine with my meal. After coffee (quite a long while after) after-dinner drinks (Cognac or Baileys). I asked for a refill of coffee at this point â it came about 10 mins later. A chocolate was also offered. Prior to landing in Jeddah (refuelling and crew change) a small half-sandwich was offered (no choice) and this was followed by a glass of orange juice served from a tray. Another gripe is that there is no tidy-up of the cabin during the re-fuelling stop. There were vast numbers of strewn blankets, discarded cups and every conceivable wrapper strewn all across the cabin and they remained there for the rest of the flight to Addis. I donât really understand why either the departing crew donât do a once-over, or a cleaning crew pop on board to do a quick tidy while we were on the ground. Overall, I like the LH PE service.

I understand that airlines have to adhere to the rules as stipulated by immigration laws, but ultimately the decision to allow me to board the flight rested with Lufthansaâs flight manager who proved to be stubborn and neither susceptible to reasoning nor my explanation that I was not intending to spend the 5 months in Singapore but would travel in the wider region.

One of the worst business class cabins I've flown - seats are narrow and tight, if you do not get a window seat there's no storage space at all for anything (window seats come with additional storage space along the fuselage) so every time you have to get up and reach the overhead bin. Film selection is so-so, the only positive side are the noise cancelling headphones. Food was average at best, service was mixed - the flight attendant taking care of my section was great, smiling, friendly and speaking English. I've noticed that on numerous Lufthansa flights that cabin crew first of all has this cold business attitude and tends to speak German, even if you speak to them in English. The second leg was ok, with a typical short haul flight seat, space and service - nothing special worth mentioning.

There was just a few rows within the Economy class and the only thing to differentiate Premium Economy from Economy was the seats and legroom (which were fine I might add). The food was the same as Economy (very average both ways even by Economy standards although printed on a different Premium Economy menu), shared the same stewards on board and at check-in and boarding there was no separate boarding queue for Premium Economy.

It's overnight flight so dinner was served promptly after take off and lights switched off soon after tables were cleared. I slept for about 7h and extra leg room helped the experience quite a lot. Manged to watch a movie at the beginning and another at the end of the flight. I like Lufthansa's IFE as it is not focused only on commercial entertainment with music section being my favorite. Light breakfast was served 2h before landing. We landed with 30min delay but it did not affect my connecting flight with another company.

I've been flying with Lufthansa for a long time but the flight to Panama was the first long-haul one that I've had using this airline. Lufthansa didn't let down and their service was really great. Flight from LHR to FRA departed on time. It was a short flight and we received snacks. Cabin was clean, crew very polite and professional. Arrival in FRA was on schedule. Transfer in FRA took more than 2 hours so there was plenty of time of getting to the required gate. Boarding started on time. The only little con, however, was that we were taken to the plane by bus, despite the fact that it was an A340-300. Cabin crew welcomed us with smiles. The plane from FRA to PTY also departed on time. Throughout the whole flight crew was present and did their best to make us feel as comfy as possible. There were 2 hot meals, snacks and plenty of drinks. What I can recommend Lufthansa, though, is to enlarge an IFE choice, especially the movie collection. For the rest the service was great and we've arrived in Panama on time.

The return flight was quite different, it started with Lufthansa canceling our flights on one date and telling us we would have to leave a day earlier or a day later the problem was I would either have to pay for an additional day which was not available - so I opted to leave a day early which meant I was out a days room rent, which is not cheap. We were also bought our tickets 6 months in advance and paid extra for seats in the front of the plane. On the flights they put us on we were in the back of the plane, telling us it didn't matter that we paid for advanced seating, that only meant you were paying for window or aisle - really - we paid $180.00 extra for a window or aisle seat. In conclusion I understand flight changes happen, but I do not understand the rudeness of the employees in Frankfurt when I went to customer service to talk about a refund on our return flight seating, which was definitely not what we paid for.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,890,A340,Couple Leisure,TPA to TLV via FRA,October 2016,1,1,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2016-11-28,"""find yourself another airline""",1,"â Verified Review |  I was supposed to fly out of New Delhi to Boston via Frankfurt on 26th November when the pilot strike was extended and I became its latest victim. My flight to Frankfurt was just a few hours away when I got a text that the other leg of my journey from Frankfurt to Boston had been cancelled. I could not afford to be stranded in Frankfurt and nearing panic and desperate, I managed to book another flight through British Airways which would land me in Boston just a few hours later than the cancelled Lufthansa flight. So seventeen hundred dollars and a lot of heartache later, I finally landed in Boston. The following day, I decided to reach out to Lufthansa customer service to inquire about my refund for my cancelled flight. A curt lady told me that the refund was in process and would take anywhere from a couple of days to a week to go through, but she would not divulge the amount to me. I went ahead and told her that I had spent $1700 to rebook my flight just so I could be back in time for my wife's surgery at which point I was told, and I quote - ""that was your decision and your problem. We are not liable for it"". So, was it my fault that Lufthansa decided to cancel my flight because of the pilot strike which is their own internal problem? And they have had this issue for years; their cabin crew and pilots have gone on impromptu strikes for the past couple of years now and the ones to suffer are the gullible passengers. Lufthansa reported recorded profits this year and it is not hard to imagine where most of that money came from: their gullible customers who they so merrily swindle at every opportunity. The only reason that I have posted this review is that I do not want another person to go through what me (and probably thousands of others) have suffered at the hands of this inconsiderate and greedy airline. I would dearly suggest to you that if you are booking your flight at least a month in advance, you are better off going with a more stable airline, as Lufthansa is very unpredictable and can cancel flights and leave passengers stranded with no recourse whatsoever.

However, there was an entertainment App available, but you need to download it before taking off. It's not available for Windows Phone, and when you get informed about the App, it's too late to install it, as flight mode is required, which to me makes no sense.

This was a special trip to Northern Italy for Christmas with my extended family and an Aeroplan reward ticket. We left pretty close to on time and they made up time on the way over. As soon as we boarded, I changed into the pyjamas and settled in for the overnight flight. Champagne and macadamias arrived quickly and on the seat was the Rimowa amenity kit. Meal service was delicious from the amuse bouche, caviar, black pepper pasta and I think it was chocolate bread pudding, though I was so full I couldn't. The wonderful champagne, I had the old world red and a lovely port. The crew on board couldn't do enough for us yet it still felt really private with a full cabin. After dinner, they made up the bed with a comfy top and bottom duvet and I got almost 5 hours of sleep. Breakfast was fresh and wonderful, I ate light as I had a 6 hour connection in Frankfurt before flying to Milan. My favourite part of flying first on Lufthansa is the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. This is a separate building with no gates attached. You walk out the main terminal doors and turn left and it's a five minute walk. Take the elevator up and they personally take care of you from then on. You can do this not only as a departing but as an arriving first class passenger too. The whole place is bar, they have a smoking room with, and I don't smoke them but my friends would love the cigars. Shower/bathrooms, private snooze rooms and comfy wing chairs and ottomans to sit and read a book. One of the three bathrooms has not only a shower but a full on soaker tub too. I booked it and read my book until my time came. Lufthansa understands that some of us still love to fly and it's about the experience and the swag. Sitting on the bath tub was another collectible Lufthansa First Class Terminal rubber ducky to add the collection. I had a delicious breakfast in the a la carte restaurant, the mimosas and long espressos were great too. It was Christmas after all and vacation. When time came to board they escorted me downstairs to a waiting limo (they have a fleet of Mercedes, Audi, BMW and Porsche vehicles from sedans to SUV's). They drive you across the tarmac to your next flight. I find it hard to fault Lufthansa these days, I like the whole experience in the air and on the ground. There are rumours that LH will discontinue first from North America, I hope not.

Only through the grace of about a billion points was I able to snag a Newark to Dusseldorf reward flight to experience Lufthansaâs renowned First Class on my way to a final destination of Lisbon. I felt somewhat unworthy as I settled myself into my 2A open suite, however, I worked hard to maintain the requisite âI belong hereâ demeanor, unlike the fellow in front of me who danced in the aisle, champagne flute in hand, celebrating after his boss switched seats with him (boss relocating to Business). The A340-600 First Class cabin was full. I spent the first fifteen minutes sipping champagne, enjoying macadamia nuts, and playing with what seemed like several hundred seating variations from which to choose. Service, food and beverage was for the most part stellar although once it was âlights outâ, our two attendants did somewhat of a disappearing act, although Iâm sure they would have been prompt if I had rang for service. The dinner service was outstanding, caviar first course, followed by a trio of appetizers, lobster main, chocolate dessert, complimented with some excellent tasting wines, and all served course by course on a well-sized and nicely laid out dining table. An after-dinner aperitif coupled with a cappuccino (and a few more sweets thrown in for good measure) concluded a wonderful dining experience. Seats were promptly converted into comfortable looking beds with myself as the only hold-out. With privacy dividers raised, the group settled into a state of individual slumber. I chose to catch up on a few recent-run films through the night. A perfect photo-op of a sunrise appeared much too early, as did the perfectly prepared breakfast offering of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  Finishing my breakfast, I changed back into my streets in the very spacious and clean washroom. There was a noticeable lack of interaction with the flight crew. Except for the obligatory âWillkommen to, Danke fÃ¼râ announcements from the flight deck, nothing else was offered. Perhaps the pilots were feeling miffed with their airline, and working to rule, choosing not to associate with even the first class passengers as has apparently happened in the past. The Lufthansa First Class experience is truly special, and not only the in-flight portion, but the other touches such as personal escort from check-in, past security, and into the lounge, as well as the lounges themselves, the service and amenities offered on either continent. As I left the sanctity of the First Class section, a sense of claustrophobia overwhelmed me and I realized I was turning my nose up at Lufthansa Business Class! And, as I sat in TAP Business on my flight segment to Lisbon, with my all-on-one lunch tray crowding my thirty four inches of pitch, I reflected on how fortunate I was to have experienced the Lufthansa First Class product.

2017-01-07,"""extremely miserable experience""",1,"â Verified Review |  Chicago to Moscow via Frankfurt. Extremely miserable experience from business class travel.  Our flight from Chicago was delayed due to some technical problem with the aircraft. Ok, I get it, troubles happen. We had to wait 2 extra hours in a rather miserable United lounge in Chicago. On the aircraft in 2 toilets out of 3 in business, the toilet seat was not holding itself while opened - meaning you have to hold it. When the aircraft was landing some of the next flights were announced to be rebooked, but neither my flight, nor my husband was. Even though there were some flights departing after our flights, we were not announced to be rebooked. When we came out of the plane, there was a service person from Lufthansa answering questions. My husband was guided to the service desk and to me the men standing there said: ""if you run you can catch your flight"". It was 9:30 am and my initial flight LH1444 was boarding at 9:15 in a different zone (we landed to Z zone in FRA airport and my boarding was at B gate). Knowing that FRA is one of the biggest airports in the world I though it may be reasonable to go to the service desk with my husband and ask for a change of the ticket as ""running"" through the airport was not an exactly appealing option for a person with a knee injury. However, when we came to the service desk, there was a man guiding the queue to service desk windows and he also told me that I should run to catch my flight. It was 9:35 AM (as mentioned before, my boarding started at 9:15 AM). So if two people told me I should run I decided to leave my husband who was traveling to Prague and try to catch my flight. The trouble was that few steps later there was a different zone of the airport, then I had to go through train and security check, being out of breath when I finally came to the gate it was 9:50 AM and my flight had already left. The lady at the desk said that she is not willing to help me and I should go back to the service desk and change my ticket. In the lounge, they changed my ticket to 12:40 pm. Same time was the flight time for my husband, but as he was flying to Prague, and me to Moscow, we had to stay in different airport zones and were not able to come to each other. When I was boarding the plane, there was no walkway, but a bus, and they were saying that business goes after families with children to the bus. And the employee on the desk was extremely rude, screaming at business passengers they should wait till all children go the bus first. On the plane, the seats were not even with adjustable head. We had to wait for 45 minutes (plus to 4h flight) for some luggage to be loaded-unloaded and for some passenger to come to the plane. During this extra time of waiting in the aircraft there were no drinks offered. ",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,914,,Couple Leisure,ORD to DME via FRA,January 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

I have been a fan of Lufthansa for many years but this flight rocked my confidence in them. Following a smooth check-in we proceeded to the lounge which was sweltering hot and had a very poor selection of food and no cold drinks. The departure was delayed due to late arrival of inbound aircraft and further delayed due to late boarding. However, there was no explanation for the reasons of delay or an apology from the cockpit. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept. It was the European business class configuration with the middle seat of economy style seating left vacant. The FA's were friendly and efficient which was the only redeeming feature of this journey. The food was below acceptable for Business Class and a huge letdown for LH. As expected we were late arriving in Munich and it took over 1 hour from the time we reached our gate for the bags to be delivered.

2017-01-10,"""the crew had arrived late""",2,"â Verified Review |  Munich to Sofia. The Lufthansa return flight ruined an otherwise perfect holiday. Flights were late on both legs of the journey. On the outgoing flight the explanation given was that the crew had arrived late the previous night and had to use up their 12 hour day rest, so the next day flight was delayed. Our return flight was cancelled 40 minutes before scheduled takeoff. Of course no explanations given, but considering that most other flights were departing on schedule it must not have been the weather. We were quickly rebooked to another flight 4 hours later. 30 min before takeoff that flight was delayed by 1.40 hours, so by the time we boarded we had almost 6 hours of delay. The flight did not depart at the newly announced time either, since doors closed more than 40 minutes later and by the time we were airborne it was another hour late. The flight itself was ok and apparently we made up for some of the delay. Little did we know that after landing we would have another hour of delay, this time waiting for our luggage. The crew's bags were delivered earlier but the passengers had to wait until 1.20 am to get their bags, with noone from Lufthansa or the ground handling operator to explain what was going on. So instead of getting home at 6 something p.m. the previous day we got home at almost 2 am on a Monday - not ideal if you have to go to work at 8.00 am (wish I had the ability to delay my start of work for the 12 hours rest, like the Lufthansa crew).",Business Class,1,1,1,,1,no,917,,Couple Leisure,MUC to SOF,January 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Why does Lufthansa bother to offer a specific Hindu Non-Veg Meal if in reality does not provide such a meal? The flight attendants were wonderful on board and did what they could. But they could only offer me yet another Non-Meat Pasta Meal because the other one offered was a Fish Meal which I do not eat at all.

Our flight was supposed to leave from Munich's new Terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the Star Alliance Schengen Business Lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Munich right now is going through a phase of Siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didnÂ´t make it to the airport on time"". Funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. During that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside Terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. Boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasnÂ´t forthcoming. Boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off Terminal 1 which LH doesnÂ´t even use. Our A320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. In fact we didnÂ´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. Obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. The flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in Barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. The Lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on European flights is worth the money in my opinion even if LH European business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. But the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean.

Boarding was unpleasant because the announcements were totally incomprehensible and the Airport Operator AENA seems to be finnicky about hand baggage sizes.

They didnÂ´t mind about that at MUC but they do at BCN. My bag was checked in and arrived on the same flight as myself in MUC, so no major disaster, but you have to be aware of the situation. The business class experience on this flight was pretty much the same as on the inbound MUC-BCN flight - friendly and attentive staff, good food and drinks, good legroom etc, but our A321 was older than the A320 on the inbound flight and had a sort of fixed tray table spanning the free middle seat which is unnecessary and uncomfortable. There is no inflight entertainment except via the downloadable LH app, which some people will object to, but I donÂ´t.

For this flight, Lufthansa uses the standard A380. I sat in seat 11D (middle row) in the upper deck. The first thing you feel in boarding this aircraft is that Lufthansa is efficient, courteous and professional. The cabin is clean if not a bit bland, but overall has a comfortable feel to it. The configuration is a 2-2-2, so the middle row is the best bet, as each seat is an aisle. The seats are comfortable and are lay-flat. My only issue is that the controls for the seat are touch and therefore, if you are resting your arm on the armrest, you seat tends to ""readjust"" itself if you brush against the controls. In the lay flat position, the seats are typical of most airlines as they are not exceedly wide, like Singapore Airlines, and narrow for the footwell. One issue is that your feet land on a ledge on the bulkhead which has only a small divider between your feet and your neighbors. Often during the flight, I was awoken as my seatmate changed position and her feet brushed mine. A minor inconvenience, but for some may be too creepy. The service on the flight was very good, if not at the personal level of some of the Asian competitors. The food was decent, but not exceptional and misses the touches of other airlines like ANA, Singapore or even Austrian. The in-flight entertainment is very good. The TV screens are large, clear and easy to see both in the dark and with the cabin lights on. The screen is operated by touch or a remote.

Also with their movement we got our knees whacked. What really gets me is that we paid for what comfort Economy Class offers but this was Sub-Economy standard: we would have had more room to move in an animal crate in the hold. Trying to read or use a laptop was so awkward that we had to give up. The laptop could not be opened more than 45 degrees. We hit some turbulence along the way and were told to buckle up. After a long period of no turbulence my wife had to go to the toilet, as soon as she got into the aisle she was told in a very commanding voice to sit down. This happened again later on when the need was desperate. Still no more turbulence and again ordered to sit down.

I was travelling as part of a group and so decided to book a seat to be close to friends. I was surprised that on a flight that cost nearly Â£1000, I would have to pay to choose my seat but I decided it would be worth paying Â£20 each way per person for myself and a companion to ensure that we sat together (Â£80 in total). The first issue I had was that the seats we were given on the flight from Frankfurt to Atlanta and the return leg were not the ones I had booked. We ended up on the very rear row of seats but we were at least sat together. On both flights (10 hours) we were served vegetarian food because apparently Lufthansa only offer chicken to those toward the front of those the plane. To make matters worse, I was later offered a hot dog for lunch, because they had run out of pizza. The hot dog was still completely frozen. I didn't make a fuss, I thought that I would get a refund for the seats and that would be the end of it. The flight itself was comfortable and smooth so I wasn't too unhappy until I spoke with Lufthansa customer services. They told me that the seat booking fee is non refundable and that booking a seat only entitles you to that ""type of seat"" and does not mean you will be sat in the seat that you chose when you made the reservation. So ultimately I have paid for a seat that I didn't get, I had the same type of seat as everyone in economy and yet they refuse to give me the Â£80 back.

In comparison to the mentioned airlines the seating has practically no privacy, the seats and configuration (with an alibi ""privacy wall"" you can use) is similar to Business Class on some airlines. The food was good, the service was something between very good and inattentive. You have to pay for using the internet. LH are not offering free limousine service at start and destination.

The aircraft A321 was clean and tidy. The cabin crew were attentive to passenger needs. Lufthansa service is great. The hot breakfast was very quick and efficient.

Barely a cold apology. We didn't know then that the experience with Lufthansa could even get much worse : our in-bound flight from JFK to FRA was cancelled the day of departure.

2017-05-23,"""great crews, great service""",8,"â Verified Review |  Washington to Birmingham via Frankfurt. This was my first experience with Lufthansa, products I experienced were Economy on the A319-100 and Premium Economy on A340-300. I opted to fly with LH as they offered both the best price for the overall trip and the most favourable times to work with my journey plans. I had initially planned to fly Economy for the entirety of the journey; however, the additional cost for a premium economy seat was so minor that it made sense to elect for the premium option. I made the booking using the LH website initially, which was fine, but then opted to manage my booking using the mobile app. The app I found to be very cumbersome and slow. It took some navigating to make simple amendments like seat choices or adding API/visa data.  I didn't have hold baggage for this journey so my exposure to ground staff was minimal. The first leg of my journey commenced at BHX. The check in process proceeded without issue; however there was a slight delay with boarding, and we departed 30 minutes late. This made me nervous given that I was meeting a connecting flight, however the cabin crew were friendly, informed us of progress and connection plans at all times. I was seated in 10A, and exit row seat with ample leg room. We were offered a basic snack (marble cake) and a juice/coffee. Service was expedient and pleasant; which is how I would describe all of the flight. After landing at FRA I proceeded to my next flight. Unlike many airlines there aren't many ground perks for flying PE with LH. no lounge access, no priority boarding. The enhanced comfort offered on board however is more than worth the cost. The PE seats on the A340 were akin to retro business class seats. Wide, with built in IFE and tray table, with a foot stand (I was in 10A again). I had an end of aisle seat which meant I was not reclined in to. The catering option offered with PE is the same as economy, served on China and with metal cutlery and a glass. It doesn't sound much but it in fact makes the experience considerably more pleasant. We were allowed use of the business class lavatories which was nice given the economy toilets were a good 15 rows back. The cabin crew overall were friendly and helpful. They seemed cheerful and willing to do as much as they could to enhance your experience. For the flight back I elected to pay to use the IAD Lufthansa BC Lounge. It cost a mere $35 and was worth every penny... however, it lacked some of the comfort and grandure usually associated with lounges. As an economy passenger I wasn't particularly fussed but If I was a BC passenger paying a flexi fare (i.e. a lot of money) I'd have found the lounge to be understaffed, A little untidy, and lacking in food options. The return legs were almost identical to the outbound; same aircraft, same seats, same comfort, friendly crew. The food on this occasion was served in tins, but this can be overlooked. Again the crew offered use of the business class lavatories which I appreciated. Overall my first experiences with Lufthansa were good.

2017-05-26,"""see passengers as real people""",9,"â Verified Review |  Budapest to Montreal via Munich. I was going to upgrade to Premium Economy, but reviews said it was pretty much the same seat and food as regular economy; so, I didn't. Online check-in was easy using the booking code, but there was no option to upgrade. To find that out, I had to go to a service counter in Munich. Flight out of Budapest was late, but staff were apologetic about it. Boarding process in Munich was a bit chaotic, since they did not inform passengers about the pre-boarding document check (which seems redundant, since they are not Customs, and we all already went through customs). Staff on the flight were friendly and attentive. They re-arranged seats for a couple with an infant, so that they could use the bassinet in the first row. The woman who gave up her seat got a voucher to use for duty free. These are really nice touches that show they see their passengers as real people with real needs. Alcohol selection was excellent: sparkling wine, wines, beers, liquors, and cognac for after the meal. The meal was fine. I liked the chicken, and the real cutlery. The entertainment system is worth choosing Lufthansa over other airlines that are offering less for within $200 of the the price. There were hundreds of movies to choose from - from many different cultures. The system was really responsive and quick. The screeN is at least 25% bigger than the ones on Air Canada, and it adjusts to more angles. USB plugs were easily accessible, right beside the screen.

I phoned Lufthansa reservations and they told me that I was right and that I absolutely did not require a visa for a 1 hour transit and I should try to check in online instead, which I did sucessfully. However, the Swissport staff at the airport still refused to give me a boarding pass and allow me to board the flight.

Victoria to Vancouver  20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada Jazz used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops; and Munich to Geneva by Air Dolomiti on Embraer E195. Vancouver to Munich on A330-300 aircraft. Air Dolomiti flights had comfortable seating, and featured a couple of different regional Italian wines on each flight. LH Premium Economy seating was 2-3-2 across (instead of 2-4-2 in economy), with an extra four inches of legroom (35-inch pitch). Extra legroom and footrest were welcome but seats were narrower than they ought to have been. Between the window-seat armrests and the fuselage was a 5-cm gap on each side of the plane, and all seats had tray tables in the armrests. The front row of Premium Economy also had IFE screens in the armrests â small screens half the size of those in the other rows. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 1Â½ hours before landing. The meals seemed to be  regular economy meals â chicken or pasta options for the main meal â except that in Premium Economy they were served on porcelain and serving size may have been slightly larger. IFE was good, although films and TV shows were classified in unexpected categories. Outbound connection from YYJ through YVR is always easy because domestic passengers can remain on the secure airside to international flights without a further security screening at YVR. Connection through MUC was better than a year ago because, although you have to go through passport control entering the Schengen area, no extra security screening was required there either. Likewise on the return trip, no further security screening was required through MUC leaving the Schengen area. When entering Canada at YVR you have to go through Canadian Border Services inspection and collect your baggage but even at that point, for passengers connecting to domestic flights, they provide a dedicated area for onward baggage transfer and a dedicated security checkpoint. Despite connection times of only 1 hour to 1Â½ hours at YVR and MUC, both my bags arrived with me at the destination. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone AC to ask for the AC booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.",Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1013,A330,Business,Vancouver to Geneva via Munich,June 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

On route from my home town Munich to the airport of Stuttgart I realized that I had forgotten my passport at home. Unfortunately it was too late to return. I started to panic as I had to catch a connection in Moscow bound for Hong Kong and all tickets, including the Lufthansa ticket to Moscow, were not allowing any changes - meaning I'd lose all tickets worth approx 2000 Euro if I weren't to get a hold of my passport somehow. I called the LH Senator hotline and they were just wonderful - they really went the extra mile in order to help or offer solutions. They even offered to change my non-changable tickets if it was of any help. Same for the ground staff at STR and FRA airport. Everyone envolved cared and showed the best customer care possible. In the end I had a friend fly from MUC to FRA to deliver my passport. With the help and care of LH my problem was solved and I could travel as planned.

2017-09-12,"""beverages were rarely offered""",7,"â Verified Review | Flight from Seattle to Frankfurt, start afternoon in SEA, arrival early morning in FRA, so it was a night flight. Unfortunately, aircraft was a Boeing, thus seats much narrower than in an Airbus. Flight on time and very calm - usual, very good Lufthansa standard. However, cabin staff was not very attentive and sometimes even rude. Beverages were only rarely offered, collection of garbage even more rare. During the night, cabin staff went through the cabin with beverage trays, but did not look carefully if some passengers might be awake and wishing something to drink. About 2 hours before landing, I asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage, i.e. three empty cups. She said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products (which I know) and she had other guests to care for. She would be back later. I asked when as I was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing, and she said ""soon"". I did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept, just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast, whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. Had a flight with Air Canada from Frankfurt to Calgary three weeks earlier, and they offered beverages much more often, and they also collected garbage. It was my first time that I experienced rude Lufthansa cabin staff, but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during long-distance flights, and they also collect garbage more frequently. Breakfast: only savoury, omelette with roasted bacon and onions. I prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of German breakfast on a flight to Germany with a German airline: some bread, butter, jam, maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. I am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers' wishes, but a choice between a Northern American breakfast and a continental (German) breakfast would have been highly appreciated. Why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner (pasta or chicken)? I still recommend and choose LH for short-distance flights within Europe. First because of Lufthansa's safety standards, second because I can cope with some kind of thirst during short flights.

2017-09-14,"""It was impossible to sleep""",1,"â Verified Review |  I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment.  I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11Â½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldnât the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt  I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled. I went to the reception desk and they had no explanation for the cancelled flight and I had been moved to LH918 flying to LHR.

I found out that the flight was canceled for whatever reason and the replacement was not possible because it was Sunday.

I went to the counter, where I was told to wait for an hour until the additional information would be available. When I asked them to re-book my flight, they said that the only option would be to go to Vienna and then to figure out by myself how to get to Graz because most probably the company wouldn't reimburse me the money for the trip from Vienna Airport to Graz. I went back to the gate, got a 10-euro voucher, and was told to come back 45 mins later for the latest updates on my canceled flight. When I came back to the gate, the ground team announced that we were going to be taken to Vienna by a plane provided by a partner company (Austrian) and transported to Graz by bus. This sounded more or less as a solution, but we were then asked to wait until 5pm to get on the plane. I wanted to re-book and to leave to Vienna earlier but found out that the company would only provide one bus at around 6pm and that theoretically I could fly to Vienna earlier and then wait to everyone else.

Tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. Had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly intâl roaming charges for calls. Original gate from ATH-MUN was rather close to our MUN-YVR, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. On arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight.Â Boarding an A330 MUN-YVR was a disaster. Other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. If youâre a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. Passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it.Â Safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go.Â Upon arrival into YVR, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in MUN and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. They were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. Total 40hrs. We wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from Lufthansa.Â It has been 7 days and still no response.Â ",Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,no,1075,A330 / A320,Family Leisure,Athens to Vancouver via Munich,October 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2017-10-18,"""onboard service is above""",4,"â Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Addis Ababa via Frankfurt. The onboard service is above average and the legroom is good. However, I had booked to leave on August 25th. On arrival at Schiphol the flight was canceled. Overbooking on another flight was not possible, everything was full. Other flights to Frankfurt departed that evening. Also on Saturdays there was only place on flights with at least three stops and a journey time which was twice as long as planned. Then only one flight took 2 days (!) Later, which cost me 2 days. Cancellation can happen and the fact that there were no good alternatives was not to blame Lufthansa. Where I can admit that Lufthansa does not wish to pay my claim. They indicate that the flight was canceled by the weather conditions. That's strange if you take into account that this was the only flight that was canceled that night, KLM just left Frankfurt. One could easily leave with a delay of an hour or so. Now, in addition to the lack of working hours, I have to make expenses to get what I am entitled to. So service on board 8.5, handling complaints a 2 - the staff is friendly, average 4.2 so. DUTCH: De service aan boord is bovengemiddeld en de beenruimte is goed. Echter ik had geboekt om op 25 augustus te vertrekken. Bij aankomst op schiphol was de vlucht geannuleerd. Overboeken op een andere vlucht was niet mogelijk, alles zat vol. Andere vluchten naar Frankfurt vertrokken wel die avond. Ook op zaterdag was er enkel plaats op vluchten met minimaal drie stops en een reisduur welke twee keer zo lang was als gepland. Toen maar een vlucht 2 dagen(!) later genomen wat mij 2 dagen werktijd kostte ter plekke. Annuleren kan gebeuren en ook het feit dat men geen goede alternatieven had is Lufthansa niet te verwijten. Waar ik mij wel aan kan ergeren dat Lufthansa niet mijn claim wenst te betalen. Zij geven aan dat de vlucht geannuleerd was door de weercondities. Dat is vreemd als je in ogenschouw neemt dat dit de enigste vlucht was die geannuleerd werd die avond,KLM vertrok gewoon wel naar Frankfurt. Men had dus makkelijk met een vertraging van een uur of zo kunnen vertrekken. Nu moet ik dus naast het gemis van werkuren onkosten maken om te krijgen waar ik recht op heb.

2017-10-18,"""their service was appalling""",1,"â Verified Review |  Newark-Liberty Intl to Munich, LH0413, 18 Sept 2017. I did not expect something elegant or sophisticated from Lufthansa, but their service was appalling. The flight was delayed due to ""late arrival of the plane"". Quite worn out plane, not much of a welcome on board, dim light in the cabin did not make me feel bad in the beginning but definitely was not comforting. I do not mind not smiling FA's if the level of service is high. On this flight, I learned for the first time what means lousy service in business class, definitely not expected from 4-star airline. Frugal menu had one appetizer (salad) with no other choices. I chose fish for the main course which was greasy, overly salty and poorly presented. Everything came on the same tray. During the meal, no drink refills were offered (I had regular coke), so I had to ask for a favor. After I asked for the tray to be taken away, FA took it and asked me to throw the tablecloth and serviette on top of the tray. I expected a dessert would have been offered but was wrong. So again I had to ask for one. Not happy with my request, FA asked what I wanted and finally brought a portion of fruits which was placed on the table without any preparation. After such ""feast"" I tried to sleep but the seat was (though full flat) bumpy and extremely narrow even for me (I am a slim person). So the only comfortable position was lying on my side. Finally, I was able to fall asleep but was awaken soon by the noise from the galley where FAs were loudly talking without lowering their voices. About 1 hour before landing I asked for breakfast. It was not served right away, so the seatbelt sign came on. FA told me that now the breakfast could not be served. No single positive emotion during the whole flight. Extremely lousy service is only memorable thing about Lufthansa. My flight back with United (Polaris business class) was a pleasant surprise â frankly, I expected the opposite for these two carriers. Lesson learned: Lufthansaâs business is an awkward decoration of a comfort+ class with a flatbed (though very uncomfortable). Given the price for the ticket (almost 9 thousand US $), I will choose Lufthansa only if there is absolutely no alternative.",Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,1077,,Business,Newark to Munich,September 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

During the flight we were  told that they had no information about connecting flights and should check the flight boards in the airport. But as soon as we landed and I switched on my phone I had an email stating that I was booked on the later 22:05 flight to Dresden.

One of my biggest complaint is the flow of economy passengers using the front lavatories. On my last flight from Lisbon to Frankfurt there were 6 people queuing up in the aisle waiting for the lavatory making it almost impossible for business pax to use the lavatories. This for some reason is standard procedure on LH. Another problem I have with them is that the crew uses the overhead bins for their own luggage leaving practically no room for their so called âpriority customersâ which are seated on rows 1&2. Food quality and quantity is also on the decline.

2017-12-02,"""will avoid Lufthansa connections""",2,"â Trip Verified | Budapest to Venice via Munich. The first flight from Budapest departed with 20-30 mins of delay. This is ok as delays can occur and the duration was rather short. However, arrival in Munich was also delayed in turn by 20-30 mins. The connection in Munich was known in advance to be short, for which reason it is expected that the airline has foreseen how to manage this flight combination. Instead this connection was managed very poorly. Arrival in Munich airport took place at the gate area K, while the connecting flight (to Venice) was at gate area G. This, according to the screen indication itself, requires 17 mins of transfer time. Upon arrival, I noticed on the screen that the connecting flight was already boarding. After taking the shuttle train (needed for this transfer) and running the rest of the way, I arrived at the gate only to discover that the flight was gone. It seems nobody bothered to advise that there was somebody on the way, and hopefully the plane could wait for a mere 10 mins. Offering a connection implies that it is reasonably managed. In spite of the short connection in this case, it seems the airline makes it even worse by setting flights at different areas and not advising of people in transfer. I would never ask a plane with all passengers to wait for a long time, but I do not believe 10 mins would be an issue for anyone. After the above experience, I went to the service desk for help, where I was told that there is ""fortunately another flight tonight"". That meant at 22:00 vs. the original 15:30 that I missed. To illustrate the staff's further lack of customer service, I was told I am eligible for a voucher since I will spend a long time at the airport. I was given a voucher for 10 euros. After indicating that a 10-euro voucher does not seem exactly a correct response from the airline for the trouble caused, I was told that maybe it was a system error, and after a second check, the staff confirmed that in fact I am eligible for 17 euro. I did not continue the discussion as it would have been a waste of time. The above service gives me an impression that the airline simply does not care. In fact it feels like a joke.

2017-12-19,"""compensation is only 300 EUR """,1,"â Trip Verified | Toronto to Manchester via Frankfurt. The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt. This would involve a 3am start and I would have to pay for a hotel. Was told that this couldn't be done but if I turned up for the flight and checked in the change could be made at check-in. Turned up at 04:00 to be told this isn't possible and I have to phone Lufthansa. Made the call and after an hour and 300 EUR I had the earlier flight. Arrived at Frankfurt and began the delays, 2 hours at the gate, then 4 hours sat on the plane as the de-icer was needed, then it was needed again. So arrived after a 23 hour day still to ensure a 4 hour drive home. So, sent an e-mail and letter to Lufthansa giving them my feedback from my first trip with them, the bad customer service and the great cabin crew. Received a call from the customer service team (located in Manila) with an apology and an offer of 600 EUR compensation. Agreed this and felt that Lufthansa had actually listened to me. 2 hours later receive a call to tell me a mistake has been made and the compensation is only 300 EUR - sorry I say, you made an offer which was accepted and I'm not accepting you changing your mind. They told me they would speak to a manager and call me back. Received an e-mail 20 minutes later to tell me my 'request' for compensation had been rejected and a cheque had been issued for the lower amount. So I called the team and over the next four days received a long line of contradictions - 'The manager will speak to you now, the manager went home whilst you were waiting, we will only talk to a lawyer, we cannot let you speak to a member of Lufthansa, we are a call agency'. Tried social media, tried all the numbers to no avail.

2017-12-29,"""served very professionally by crew""",9,"â Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Mexico. We connected in Frankfurt from a flight coming from Brussels, disembarking this flight we were met by a driver who took us with a Mercedes to the exit nearest to the First Class Terminal. We had to exit the airport and walk about 200 meters; alternatively we could have used a First Class lounge in the airport but we preferred the First Class Terminal. The First Class Terminalwas a good choice as it is just fabulous. I also had sufficient time to take a shower (accompanied with a First Class Terminal duck). About 20 minutes before departure an agent took us to the Mercedes that drove us directly to the plane. With a dedicated elevator we went up close to the first class entrance of the plane. Seating in the nose of the Boeing 747-8i is very spacious and comfortable. The seat converts into a flat bed and you can raise a privacy screen. Soon after takeoff caviar was served which is one of the highlights of a Lufthansa first class flight. Soon some appetizers were served followed by the main course. There were 4 options for the main course; duck (which Iâm not fond of), a beef stew (also not my favourite), a vegetarian option (pappardelle) or fish. Since fish was the only option I was attracted to I took it. The fish was âloup de merâ, presentation was rather uninspired and the taste was extremely salt. Luckily the cheese and dessert trolley had some very good options and all was served very professionally by the crew which was one of the best and most dedicated I ever had. Champagnes and wines were not the most well renowned names as with some other airlines but the quality was extremely good and typical for the regions/varieties. Just before landing the crew came to say us goodbye personally. We landed on time in MEX and were welcomed by a Lufthansa representative holding a board with our names. The representative took us directly to the diplomatic passport immigration desks. Next we went to the luggage belt where our HON labelled luggage was already standing in front of the belt. This was really amazing; from getting out of the aeroplane to getting out of the airport with our luggage took us only a couple of minutes. This was the fastest I ever went through immigration.

The points I mention donÂ´t mean much, but in combination they make you wonder why you spent more than the price of an economy class ticket. Outbound flight MUC-ATH (Jan.13th, 2018): I noticed that the Business Class security fast lane at MUC airport was not open. The food in the business lounge at MUC is fine but the same. When boarding the aircraft you used to be addressed by name, not for me. The A321 business cabins have a fixed tray table across the middle seat which is very awkward for sitting down and getting up when you have a window seat. An economy class passenger stowed his hand luggage in the business class overhead compartment. No welcome drink, and announcements in German and English, no Greek.  The onboard choice of meals consisted of two main courses, the one I chose I found inedible. LH always serves freshly baked bread which is nice but for some reason they forgot me so I had to ask for it. After meal, economy class passengers queued to use the business class toilet. Return flight ATH-MUC the lounge at ATH airport nice with  better food than MUC but no toilets. Staff took the trouble to annouce LH departures personally which was a nice touch. At gate, priority boarding was announced but not enforced. This is one of the most annoying problems with LH business class travel and it happens all the time. On the flight, again no announcements in Greek, food markedly better, but disorganised service.

The TLS-FRA flight arrived late, leading to miss the connecting flight to SIN and causing me to spend the night in FRA. These things happen, and as a frequent traveler working in the aerospace industry, I'm more understanding than most. However, I was not impressed at all by the way the situation was handled:  no information was given by the crew about the delay of the TLS-FRA leg. We were just stuck in the aircraft, doors closed, and not moving. After asking multiple times, I was told by the FA it was because of fog in FRA. When I proceeded to claim compensation, the airline told me it was because of French Air Traffic Control Strike. Remembering the chaos in FRA airport that evening, I have a hard time believing that. No staff was available to provide assistance once arrived in FRA airport. All customer service desks were closed, even though it was obvious that there was a big mess in FRA. It was impossible to reach the hotline to check for alternative flights. I stayed online for 2 times 45 mns, before giving up. So I organized my own hotel, transportation and meals, and in line with EU regulation 261/2004, I asked the airline to pay for the expense incurred. It has now been 4 months, and I have yet to receive the funds. I received a reply 6 weeks ago telling me the payment has been made, but it never reached my bank account. Now, customer relations department is just playing dead. On the onboard experience itself, I would say that the crew is professional, but rather cold. Food is edible, but I thought below average of other full service airlines. The major issue lies with FRA airport, where connections are very long: I had to walk 35 mns and take a train to reach the other terminal. Security was very long, with only 2 lines open, and rude staff at every checkpoint (passport control, security, boarding gates).

2018-02-17,"""leaves a lot to be desired for""",8,"â Trip Verified |  Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",Economy Class,1,1,1,,1,yes,1145,,Business,Frankfurt to Milan,February 2018,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The service was basically an economy service with some enhancements (juice as welcome drink, food was served on china plates, but is the same food as in Economy). The flight attendants were professional as usual on Lufthansa, but the service was nothing exceptional.

But the seat comfort and entertainment on Lufthansa A380 is in my opinion below average.

Security at JFK T1 is always disorganized, with pre check sometimes available and often not. This time, there was  a dedicated lane, I got to pass with shoes on, but, at x ray, the officer suddenly insisted âthere is no precheckâ and sent my bag to be prodded, examined and swabbed. LH owns a quarter of T1 and so would seem to have a at least a quarter of the responsibility to sort out the chronic security mess. The lounge was overcrowded and under catered, worn and unchanged. Pre flight dining is now a standard expectation for C class transatlantic flights, but here for a 10.30 pm departure, the offer is a bowl of canned vegetables, sadly wilting on a steam table, next to Teriyaki chicken. There are also some chicken wraps, just about edible. The wines are basic. Pre flight at TXL is even worse. Mobile boarding passes must be exchanged for paper at the desk - no obvious reason; the lounge is outside security, shabby, with a flair of filth. At 4pm, when you might want a bite to catch up on a missed lunch, catering consists of pretzel and potato salad. The security line is long and slow, inspection excessively manual. When you are on the plane, things improve. The A330 on the route has an F cabin but operates C class only, so the front is partly given away to preferred passengers and partly sold to less preferred ones for Euro 450 per leg. I got an F seat free on the way over and paid for the way back, so had very comfortable flights. Of course the experience is not representative of regular C, which is the 2x2x2 layout.

I regret the decision. The worst feature is the extremely narrow seat. I'm not large but found it to be a tight fit around the shoulders. Also, the seat is on a sideways angle, meaning that it's not a natural position in which to sleep in the bed mode, further complicated by the fact that the footwell is very narrow indeed. This is a 2-2-2 configuration and the seats are far too close to each other and lack any real sense of privacy (nor do they have a privacy screen). I do the same sector frequently and this is by far the worst of the major airlines. The cabin looks great but in practical terms (ie the need to sleep), it is very poor.

The meal was pretty good and rich but we had to wait 1,5 hours to get our first drink and there was no second beverage round as on the outward flight to TLV.

I asked the staff to confirm this information, but she told me that everything was indicated on the ticket, which was not the case since it did not indicate the local time of arrival to Tokyo, so I had to request the information from another staff. Finally, the flight took off later than the scheduled time expected so I was afraid that I could not connect flights on time. In Frankfurt, you can experience some delay while making flight connections.

The benefits were obvious, especially when travelling with a little, impatient child - you'll learn to love the fast lane, the lounge (even though the one in PMI is quite disappointing, but it is run by the airport itself and used for every airline), and the priority luggage service (which I never noticed on business trips, as I only had carry-on luggage). We loved the quiet atmosphere in the well booked business class compartment - our daughter had two seats on her own to take a nap almost throughout the entire flight.

AKG noise cancelling headphones, and adjustable IFE screen. Slight criticisms - the pockets for placing items were not very large, for example, difficult to fit in an iPad, and not many clever storage crannies. Service throughout was efficient but lacking the warmth and friendliness of Asian airlines. Food for dinner was served on departure and the menu looked good. Breakfast before arrival was less impressive; but edible nonetheless.

In the end, delayed by about 30 mins. Boarding was free-for-all, given the delay, but still relatively pleasant. Business seating on this flight was exactly the same as economy, except for the fact that the centre seat is left empty with a ""seat-filler"", that allows you to ""share"" the empty seat space with your other seating partner as a table-rest. Legroom also felt pretty much the same as economy. There was no IFE, other than ""pay-for-service"" wifi, if you wished. The differentiation is the food, obviously - as we were served a full breakfast on this 2 hour hop, with the food being even better than the business class breakfast served on the long-haul LH flight.

This area does not have bassinet fixing positions. The modern seat was as efficient and high-tech as before, really simple to adjust your seat to achieve a variety of positions including lie flat. Service was more friendly this time, though also with a Germanic reserve (none the worse for that!). Dinner was served shortly after departure, and was pleasant enough fare. Overall cabin ambience was good enough to achieve a fairly comfortable sleep, and awoke for breakfast - which was really not deserving of the term, it was the first time I ever managed not to eat scrambled eggs and cheese at 40,000 feet!

2018-06-08,"""definitely recommend Lufthansa""",9,"â Trip Verified |  One of the best airlines I have flown. I started my journey in Seattle and travelled to Zurich via Frankfurt, Germany. I had flown with them a couple of times before, all positive experiences, and I was looking up to my flights. The ground staff were excellent, although I was a little disappointed to find out that Seattle Airport doesnât offer any bag wrapping options. The ground staff was very friendly and helpful. After I checked in my bag, I headed to the lounge. Although it was crowded and not Lufthansaâs own lounge, it was a great lounge. The seats were very comfy, WI-FI was fast, food was good, and the staff was very friendly. Boarding started on time and in the correct order. Boarding went very smooth, and as soon as I boarded, I was welcomed to the purser. The food was great and seat very comfortable. I slept great and enjoyed my meals. Lufthansaâs staff is outstanding. A man sitting next to me was very inpatient and kept complain about the fact that the person behind him got his meal first even though he had a higher status. I would have already stopped serving, but the crew kept smiling and putting up with his moaning. My flight was great and I would definitely recommend it. After I landed in Frankfurt, I had a 4 hour layover until my connection to Zurich, but it went great and very smooth. As I was very tired, I headed to the lounge to rest, but after the lounge staff saw I was almost sleeping in my seat, they offered me a bedroom with a shower. The bed was perfect and the room looked like a 4-star hotel. The shower was outstanding and I was impressed with the service. After my rest, I headed to my connecting flight to Zurich. This flight also went very smooth and the food was great. After I landed, I accidentally forgot my iPhone on the plane, but before I had even noticed I left it, the flight attendant came running through the terminal to give it to me, I was amazed. My bag was the first one to come out in the baggage claim, which was very nice.

2018-06-12,"""turned out to be a nightmare""",1,"â Trip Verified | This is my 3rd bad experience with Lufthansa in the last 3 months and I think I need to share it. I was travelling Business Class from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then to London with a layover in FRA of 1hr 45min. Boarding at ZAG was done without priority boarding. When landing at FRA the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. Not only no separate bus was used for C class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. When I reached Terminal A I had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates B where my flight for LHR was departing from. I have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within Europe, yet Lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. The queue for the security was one of the longest I have ever seen in my life. As a business class passenger and Star Alliance Gold member I attempted to enter the Fast Track. A lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""No"", despite me showing her my C class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. I asked her three times whether Lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""No"". I waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. When I reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. The Lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. There are not a lot of benefits for business class European flights. People pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that Lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. What should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. I have experienced inconsistent and bad service from Lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that I would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.",Business Class,1,1,1,,1,no,1211,CRJ1000 / A320,Business,Zagreb to London via Frankfurt,June 2018,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Unfortunately flying it in economy is just awful. I was seated in row 16, the first row of a mini cabin between club and premium economy, where seats are sold at premium prices. The seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong, not a chance to get comfortable. IFE could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could, so gave up on that. The insult after injury was the main meal: a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo! The German kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. Tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why?

They emailed confirmation of cancellation without any acknowledgement of the refund in writing. 6 weeks, 6 phone calls and an email inquiry later, I am still waiting. It took over a week for someone to respond to my urgent inquiry, with a generic, unhelpful response. The call centre staff have been completely unwilling to take my situation seriously and don't seem to understand the aspect of holding onto funds for which they are not providing a service.

We have arrived to Frankfurt airport, check in, passed security control, and we waiting for boarding. 15 minutes before flight they said that flight is canceled and we have to go to a counter. We went to counter. There was long queue. It was approximately 20 flights canceled, due to bad weather. So after 1.5 hour in the queue we have reached counter. Staff was quite rude, they told us to go to another counter in departure area. We went there. There was several times longer queue. Here we spent approximately 5 hours prior to reaching counter. Here staff was more friendly. They put us on waiting list for 8 a.m. flight and give vouchers to hotel. Next morning we have repeated exercise. In boarding area they told us that it is 40 people on waiting list and only two seats, so we have to go back to counter. I ask, is it possible to talk with manager. Answer was quite rude: go to counter and there will be your manager. We run to counter. This time we reach it in 40 minutes. They rebook us on waiting list of 11:50 flight and told us that at noon air dispatchers strike in Italy will start. There I realized that we may reach Florence by some miracle this evening, otherwise we may not get there even till our train to Verona. We decided to change plans and cancel our flights to Florence and from Verona. They told us that we have to go to different counter on second floor. Another hour waiting and we are again in front of window. They told us that here we can only cancel flight, but to start procedure of returning money I have to go to site and feel up some request. They told us that we may get our luggage in half an hour to one hour. Of cause, it took us 2.5 hours to get it. Mean while I feel up that form. It was not from the first attempt that I was able to submit it. To summarize our experience: of cause there could be different circumstances, like weather conditions, strike etc., but it would be good attitude to send manager to each canceled flight area and talk with passengers, figure out their needs, try to find some solutions. Nothing of this was done. In addition to that normal companies did not canceling flights due to temporary weather conditions, just postponing it.

It would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate! But then I realised from the live departure board that my flight to London has departed. As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me.

Myself and my 15 month old daughter are traveling from Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. When we reached the airport, they checked in the bag and when they checked the passport, they found that my wife cannot travel as there is a new rule that if you have a layover in Frankfurt, we need a valid schengen visa or a US stamped visa. We told Lufthansa that you never told us anything while booking the tickets or even when i called them to pay for the seat allotment as Lufthansa charges person for getting the bassinet seat (Most other airlines provide it free if you book the flight with infant). Lufthansa just want to get the money from you and never provide any information. The person at the check in counter said it is in our website and i asked him to show it, he went and wandered for 15 minutes and said he lost the sheet which had that information. I checked their website and nothing says about the rule. They mention that if you have two layover within Europe you need schengen visa, but not for a single layover within Frankfurt. And the person in the counter said, if you have booked the ticket through Lufthansa, the customer service should provide me alternate route. So, i called the customer service as i booked the flight through Lufthansa.com. When i called Lufthansa customer service, they told me that they cannot do anything apart from cancelling (which i dont get any refund) or postpone the flight to some other day so that i can go and get schengen visa. I am speaking to them saying getting schengen visa takes days and my wife and daughter has to travel within couple of days. The customer service person said they cannot do anything. So, i went back to the check in counter and the person over there called the supervisor who made a call to customer service of Lufthansa and explained the situation. Lufthansa finally said they can put us in another flight with a huge layover everywhere and also it cost us $1500 more as it is considered as one way flight and we need to pay from our pocket. I have been going through all this mess in the airport and took almost 4 hours with the 15 month old baby sitting in the airport. I decided not to fly with Lufthansa as they treated really really bad and went to Qatar Airways and flew with them, who provided excellent care for the baby and myself. But Lufthansa didnt stop there, they charged me extra for missing the flight and also charged me more as my return flight is with Lufthansa. So, i ended by paying more than $3500 for the entire flight from Detroit to Chennai and my return flight. The person in the check in counter said, they see same scenario everyday (at least 2 people every day). Lufthansa is  making free money from 2 people at just one airport and i am imagining how much money they make from all the airport around the world. They charge people when they knew that they cannot fly and also charge them more whey they miss the flight due to Lufthansa mistake. While booking the ticket, why cannot Lufthansa mention this. Lufthansa mention that you need to have a valid schengen visa is there is multiple layover within Europe. If you can say that, why cannot Lufthansa say that if you don't have a valid US visa or a Schengen visa you cannot have a layover in Frankfurt.

2018-06-28,"""Worst A380 layout I have flown""",4,"â Trip Verified |  Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt. Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrÃ©e selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival.

The food was mediocre to bad, the service was, overall (although there were a couple of notable exceptions), mechanical or indifferent (at best), sometimes bordering on downright rude. Once the food was served, on all 4 flights (with the partial exception of FRA-ATH), service was non-existent. We were not proactively offered anything (drink, etc) on flight ATH-MUC, the curtain between Business and Economy was left open for most of the flight, with the result that the Business class lavatory was used by people from Economy. None of the cabin crew tried to stop them. Surely one of the benefits of flying a Business class cabin is to have a dedicated bathroom? The boarding process was chaotic - any notion of priority boarding was a joke. On 1 flight by the time we boarded, other passengers had filled the storage space. Since we were seated at seats 2D and 2F, where we had no option but to store everything in the overhead lockers, I believe that someone should have made sure that people on the other rows stored things under the middle (empty) seats. To his credit, the steward very kindly helped us find a solution - no pre-flight drinks were offered, on one flight no menus were offered. We were offered a choice of ""meat"" or ""paella"".

The first leg of this trip was operated by Lufthansa Air Rail, which is a train service. While Miles&More Senators/HON and Lufthansa Business Class customers are allowed to use the DB Lounge at Cologne Central Station, this service is not provided to Star Alliance Gold customers. Still, I find the 50-minutes train ride from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt a very convenient alternative compared to flying. What I do not like is that there are no check-in agents at Cologne Station anymore â they have been replaced by a check-in machine. So it is not possible to make changes to the ticket: No change of flights, seats, frequent traveller card or APIS when flying to the US. Security at Frankfurt was very quick and I went directly to the lounge closest to my departure gate in the A terminal (A30). It was a business class lounge and had a really good selection of food and I nice tarmac view. It even had showers (which I did not use). I found it better that the Senator Lounges. The flight from FRA to CPH was fully booked in Economy, so no free middle seat. Nice crew, a bite to eat and two drink services (1h15m flight!). All in all a good experience. No obverhead screens or personal device entertainment available on this Lufthansa flight. WiFi was available for a charge. Verdict: Good flight, good airline. Would choose them again.

The food is decent, drinks plentiful, and seats are about as comfortable (uncomfortable) as you would expect. Lots of in-flight entertainment options, which is good. The way back through Munich was a mess. For whatever reason we couldn't check in online. We called and were told we could check in at the airport the next morning at the airport to get our boarding passes, then do the same again once we were in Munich. This went OK for the first short flight, but horrible for the connection. The Lufthansa service desk in Munich wouldn't print our passes and sent us to the gate without alerting anyone. Lufthansa has an extra security check-in before the gate, and those employees didn't want to let us through without a boarding pass. This resulted in about twenty minutes of additional delay with three other confused Lufthansa employees. We finally made it to the gate where we were then reprimanded by another Lufthansa employee for being late for boarding. She refused to sit my husband and I together (?), so we were placed in separate aisles. Once on board the flight, the seat I had been given was in between a woman and her two children. She asked me to move, which I did. The row behind my husband's assigned seat was almost empty, so we ended up sitting there together.

Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1Â¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options â vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes.

The entertainment was massively improved: at least twice as much movies and programs have been added to system, that contains interactive maps. Last but not least, and which is most important was the crew. The crew was not only very professional (which is state of the art @ Lufthansa) but attentive. Even though the level of Singapore Airlines or Emirates is not reached yet but the Lufthansa crew kept taking care of the passengers the whole flight. Lufthansa merits the 5 star rating if all flights would have the same level as I experienced during this one. To be improved is the seat though.

The crew was kind and helpful, they weren't irritated because of the delay and answered our questions. At the Frankfurt hub, the transfer waited for us at the gate, giving it somewhat of a delay, maybe 20 min's or so. The organisation of the hub was average, but the FRA airport is really large, so we had to run several kilometres from the arrival gate to the departure one. There didn't seem to be much organisation either, with gates lying far apart although the nearer gates were vacant. Overall I had a good experience though, even counting the delay. There were Wi-fi, but one had to pay for it, in three different levels of WiFi speed and amount, ranging from approximately 3â¬ up to 7â¬.

The original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes, which is more than enough. However, the boarding time was delayed twice as I was waiting in Basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. So I asked the front desk what should I do in order to catch my second plane, and she  couldn't give a useful answer, saying you should be able to catch it.

However, I have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. This is simply no way for me to speed up. I ran  but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. So I have to go to the service center for the rebook. But the queue is super long. They only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people.  And the officials didn't even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. This isn't my first experience of a tight transfer so I do have some example to compare. I remember when I took a Swiss airline from Beijing to Zurich, the plane was late due to frost for two hours. However, during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew.

At the service desk, the employee was helpful and kind. I was giving a voucher for the hotel, dinner, breakfast, and transportation. They put me on the next flight to Toronto for the next day. This helped alleviate my distress and it showed that Lufthansa strived to do right by their customers when a mistake is made. On the flight, the staff and Lufthansa work hard to make the economy not feel like an economy cabin. We were given hot towels twice, headphones, blankets, snacks, drinks, and food. I've been to other airlines and they don't usually give out that much. It makes the flight bearable and quick.

Unfortunately, there is no Lufthansa employee in the entire Lufthansa check-in is area as it is handled by a third party and they could not help me.

After a delayed flight from Sofia to Frankfurt, I missed my connection back to Florence which in and of itself would not be a problem if I did not have another flight the very next day from Rome to Bangkok, ironically connecting in Frankfurt again. The flight was not on the same booking as I had taken a last minute trip to Bulgaria and felt comfortable giving myself one day in Florence before my flight back to Bangkok. What would have been a few busy days of traveling quickly turned into a nightmare. After a long walk to terminal B to the transfer counter, which I could not find and was not clearly marked, me and hundreds of other frustrated and tired customers got in line. Standing there I realized that I could potentially miss my return flight to Bangkok the next day because of a one hour delay; my best laid plans were ruined. As I inched forward slowly to the front of the line, I could see the agitated groups of people huffing and puffing about their misfortune. I started to feel a tinge of panic too. Standing in the very front I looked at the flashing number and approached the counter. I was greeted with a welcoming smile and cheerful voice. Already an amazing feat as far as I was concerned seeing the amount of verbal abuse that was going on at the counters while I was waiting. This immediately put me more at ease. I explained my predicament: If the earliest flight from Frankfurt to Florence landed at 9:30, I would not get home to get my other bag and drop off the keys to my friend's apartment until at least 10:30, it's a 30 minute walk to the train station and a taxi is not much quicker then I would have to hope there was a train right away. If my some twist of fate I got an 11:15 train, I'd be at Rome central station at 12:45 and then have to hope again there was a coinciding train to the airport just at that moment which would get me there around 1:30pm for a 2:55pm flight and that is if absolutely everything went my way carrying two pieces of luggage in the hot August sun. Maybe some daredevils think that is plenty of time but I'm a traveler that arrives 3 hours early for every flight. Just thinking about that time frame was causing me stress. The friendly woman behind the counter listened and empathized with a smile. She could have just told me that even though both flights were with Lufthansa because they were on different bookings that there was nothing she could do. She could have politely told me that the 8:30am flight was the best she could do or brushed off my concerns and turned her attention to the hundreds of people behind me. But instead she really took my case as a whole, as a human being with a problem that she could help solve.

The check-in staff told me that the first flight was delayed so I would miss the connection. The impression was this was very much my problem and I should speak to the reservations line. Reservations changed me to a flight via Vienna to stay the night in a hotel courtesy of the airline and fly to Zagreb early the next day. I was satisfied with this. I asked the check-in staff whether I should get the hotel voucher from them or from Vienna airport - they were clear that I should collect this from the Austrian Airlines representative at Vienna airport. On arrival at Vienna I was told by the Austrian Airlines representative that Lufthansa had put no information on their system relating to my needing accommodation for the night. They spent 20 minutes trying to contact Lufthansa reservations and were not able to - on speaking to a representative at the Frankfurt Lufthansa headquarters the Austrian Airlines rep was told ""that's not my responsibility"". There was a pop concert on in Vienna - there were no rooms or only rooms with inflated prices available and I could not afford the cost of a taxi to/from the city and a hotel myself. I approached two hotels in walking distance who told me they had rooms only accessible with a voucher. Austrian Airlines would not provide me with a voucher without Lufthansa indicating on their system that this was agreed. The rep apologised for the experience I was having due to Lufthansa but was  unable to act without their ticking a box on the system.  I spent the night on the floor of the airport.

Yet, Lufthansa did nothing to get us on that plane (I assume it was out on the tarmac - the busing around the Frankfurt airport to and from the planes is ridiculous). Instead, we had to go to customer service and were re-booked on a flight the following day. Customer service actually seemed annoyed that they had to deal with us. Then to make matters worse, the customer service rep said they would book us at a nice hotel in center city so we could see Frankfurt. The hotel was no where near center city - we were in some warehouse district that was not walking distance to anything. To get to center city was a walk and two bus rides away or a 40 euro round trip taxi ride. Ridiculous! The extra 24 hours in Frankfurt was awful and I couldn't wait to get out of there.

The inflight entertainment system on the trans-Atlantic flights had a decent selection of movies and music, but my screen kept freezing and crashing, and had to be reset, on both long-haul flights. The food on the EWR-FRA segment was okay, but the chicken meal on the FRA-EWR flight was absolutely horrible. Decent bar service on both long-hauls though. The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful. I just barely made it to the gate a few minutes before they closed the doors. My already short connection was made even shorter due to the fact that the flight from Vienna landed what seemed like several miles from the actual terminal, and we were then treated to a 15-minute bus tour of Frankfurt airport, so I ended up literally having to run all the way to my next gate. Overall, I'd still fly LH again, they're still better than any USA-based airline, as well as better than many European ones, but as a supposed 5-star carrier, they really need to improve the food on long-haul flights, work out the glitches in the entertainment system, and take better care of passengers' luggage.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1286,Boeing 747-800,Solo Leisure,Newark to Kiev Boryspil/Vienna via Frankfurt,August 2018,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

After leaving the A380 - huge masses of people were herding in every direction imaginable and no one from Lufthansa greeted the flight or was there to assist First Class passengers. Over an hour later, I managed to find my way to the First Class lounge where the agents were clueless and acted like I was expecting too much to expect assistance, even after I had asked about it and tried to confirm it would be available.

Online booked at Lufthansa, the flight PEK-CKG was carried out as part of the Star Alliance by Air China with a LH flight number. In Hannover the luggage was labeled to CKG. I asked if the luggage had to be picked up in Beijing and re-boarded to CKG, I did not receive conclusive information in Hanover and at the boarding gate in Munich. The lady at the boarding gate in Munich has looked in the PC, but she was not able to give a conclusive answer. She just gave the advice to ask in Beijing! On my objection that I do not speak Chinese, she said that at the jetway when leaving the plane there are always someone with English language skills. That was not the case. Then, as a precaution, I waited for my suitcase on the luggage belt, which then came. The food of the flight section MUC-PEK can be classified as problematic. The first leg of the return flight, which I took with my wife, was done by Air China. The first leg was delayed by 1:40 hours due to fog in CKG. We had to fear for our connection in Shanghai, because an airport change from Shanghai Hongqiao to Pudong (around 60 km) was necessary. When we made our online booking only a terminal change was indicated for Shanghai. Later it was changed in an airport change. Air China was unable to obtain any assistance because of the delay. Then there was an altercation at the check-in CKG because of the number of luggage (2 pieces each 23 kg per person). Air China wanted to carry only 1 piece with 20 kg/person. Furthermore, it was forgotten to enter the passport number on my wife's boarding pass, as soon as the next trouble occurred at the security checkpoint. On the flight from Shanghai to Munich I had problems with the adjustment of the footrest. The adjustment knob often fell out of its holder, making the operation of the footrest problematic.

My parents could not leave their seats since they were waiting for the wheel chair since they were not sure when they would get the assistance. My repeated enquiries with ground staff did not yield desired results - all they kept saying was be patient for almost 2 hrs. The supervisor said there is nothing they can do and told me there was no formal way for me to leave a written complaint.

However, this young lady despite the challenges held her resolve and âpassed the testâ literally speaking. She was not to be rattled by such behaviour. She went about her duties in methodic manner and executed her service in a timely and professional manner. No running back and forth servicing one passenger at a time, or forgetting this or that.

2018-11-26,"""isn't worth the money we spent""",7,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Munich. First time my son and I decided to try flying in Premium Economy as we were flying with Lufthansa. In short, it isn't worth the money we spent. It was more comfortable than flying in Economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. Differences between Economy and PE are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of Economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. The kit has 'Cerruti 1861' on it not Lufthansa and was just okay. They serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which I think should be varied. The drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. British Airways and Air France serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. The service was fine. We had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. Food was tasty. However, there are just two choices: Meat dish or pasta. And the portions are as small as a frozen meal. Everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. Bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. The flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. However, the choices were either crackers, Lindt chocolates, and juices and water. Seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. I found it problematic to recline. In fact, I could not figure out how to do so. And the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. If I weren't sitting next to my son I'd need to ask my seat mate if I could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. Worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire PE section and they were filthy. Plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. In fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. Sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. Also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. I've flown British Airways and Air France which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. This was a connecting flight between Munich and Rome. Hated that we were not told that upon arrival in Rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. It was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. Would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. All in all, I'd have to think hard if I want to spend another $2K for Lufthansa's PE in future. I just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in Economy.

We arrived back in Toronto and were kept on the plane, there was some confusion as to whether we would be flying out that evening or being rebooked the following day. Through the entire ordeal the stewardesses were fantastic and patient as people were frustrated. They adjusted the problem with the plane and it was decided we would fly out, however, due to the delay many of us missed our connecting flights. When we arrived in Frankfurt we were rescheduled onto another flight to Munich, and then we would fly from Munich to Napoli. They offered us a 40â¬ voucher for lunch at the airport. My children by the end were impatient and tired and all of the staff we encountered were helpful and patient. The children were given toys (my eldest was given Lego on one flight) and colouring books to entertain them throughout the flights. All of the planes were clean and modern. The only downside is children under 2 are not given meals.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1356,,Family Leisure,Toronto to Naples via Frankfurt,November 2018,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

LH MUC-ORD departure thus delayed nearly 2 hours. Long time to sit on the plane. Thus, missed UA ORD-DEN connecton. At LH service desk in ORD, discovered my wife had been booked by MUC LH on LH ORD-LAX, not ORD-DEN. LH ORD told us only choice was to take AA flight next morning to DEN. As that was the only choice that LH offered, we accepted. LH put us up in a distant rather basic hotel. Arrived at AA (Terminal 3) early next morning to check in. Long line. Denied boarding. AA said LH incorrectly booked our AA tickets. We have to go to LH in Terminal 1 to sort it out. Thus missed AA flight. Arrived at LH in Terminal 1 and told they would not open for 8 hours. Went to UA, they tried to help. There was a UA flight at 8.45 to DEN. Why didnt LH book us on that instead of AA. UA called LH to get OK to write the ticket (Hey, Star Alliance, right?). LH agrees but disconnected before transaction completed. UA agent calls again. Starts to tell story, disconnect. Calls again, starts to tell story, disconnect. Finally he is able to tell the story and again request OK to issue ticket. LH says: NO! No? Yes, no. You have to go back to AA (Terminal 3) and ask AA to reissue the ticket to UA. But, wait, there is no valid AA ticket. That is the problem. In any event, if we go back to AA, we will miss the UA flight. So I buy the tickets, and I will ask LH to reimburse. UA prints out receipt and says surely LH will reimburse. After all, if the LH agent in ORD had been paying attention, he would have issued a ticket on UA and not AA in the first place. However, now, LH says no refund. Not even for goodwill. We have received off letters from LH about this. LH says the wait for passengers in MUC, the misbooking of my wife to LAX instead if DEN, the failure by the LH agent in ORD to find to the UA connection to DEN, and the improperly issued AA tickets in ORD were all due to bad weather in Europe. It took us 42 hours to get to DEN. I will try to avoid using LH in the future. The ground staff was incompetent and uncaring.

2019-02-19,"""boarding was a total mess""",5,"â Trip Verified | Miami to Munich. How Lufthansa is a 5 star airline has always baffled me but this time I really got the confirmation. I will not blame them for the 3 hours we spent on the plane before departing on our outwards trip (MUC-MIA), there was heavy snowfall in Munchen and we had to wait for the runways to be cleared and the plane to be deiced. However, during those 3 hours there was no service at all. I wasn't expecting much, but a glass of water would have been nice though. Now, the A380s cabin is seriously outdated. And even though it's clear that the plane we flew on recently underwent a C-check, being repainted in the new livery, the didn't bother retrofitting the cabin, so you get a 10 year old in-flight entertainment system. The touch screen barely works, it's slow to respond and responds only to every 3rd of 4th command. And on the inbound leg (MIA-MUC) the control keys (volume, channel, reading lights) didn't work at all. The IFE also froze and reset several times. On the outbound flight some passengers had the IFE not working at all and although they announced on the PA systems that they reset it several times, it didn't solve the problem. We also landed with the cabin light on (they should have been turned down) due to the same electrical problem. The seats are quite uncomfortable and the pitch in economy is just bearable and there are large metal containers protruding in the leg area. I have flown on low cost airlines which had the same seat pitch. There were no amenity kits provided, which if I'm not mistaken, should be provided by a 5 star airline, even in economy (I have flown on ones that do). The food is also nothing to brag about, it's half decent but certainly expected more from such a prestigious airline. On our backward trip the crew arrived late (but again, not their fault since there was an accident and a traffic jam), however the boarding process was a total mess. People aligned according to their seat numbers, but then they decided to randomly close lanes and just board people wherever. There wasn't even a boarding announcement, just for first and business class. When they started boarding Economy and Economy Premium they just opened two random lanes. This meant that no one really knew what's going on and the random boarding made the boarding time unnecessarily long for such a large plane (people in the back which should have been first ended up waiting for people in the front to sit down, who should have been boarded last). The crew however is pleasant, smiles and does a good job. The pilots also seemed professional and seemed to have everything under control, despite quite rough turbulence at times. At least this time our bags arrived safe, this is a miracle for Lufthansa since they managed to break 2 trolleys on my previous flights. In conclusion, definitely not a 5 star airline and regret choosing them over the other 5 star airline with which I could have flown (despite the fact that my flight time to MIA would have been an hour longer since they operate from a different hub and would have had other connecting flights).",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,1381,A380-800,Couple Leisure,Miami to Munich,February 2019,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The seat back touch screen IFE monitor was easy to operate and had a limited selection of movies, both old and new. The crew although polite and professional were non-engaging, despite there were only eight passengers in the PE cabin. As for the seat itself, a few inches of recline, foot rest and adjustable head rest made the journey very comfortable for the 6 hour flight to Riyadh for a 45 minute stop and onto Bahrain. I thoroughly enjoyed this flight both ways. Even though the trip is longer via Frankfurt, it was much better (and cheaper) than a non-stop PE flight.

I was flying on a rather new Airplane (B747-8) but Lufthansa seems to be using old  seats in this plane. The Infotainment system has tiny screens and is super unresponsive. The touchscreen often registers your tap in a different location. Food: The food quality is ok but below the standard of other airlines. It is obvious that Lufthansa is trying to cut some costs. For example my meal included a salad that only had the leaf in it, no tomato or other vegetables that usually belong in a salad. For my chicken I thought they served me tofu because it was just some white cubes of something dumped into some sauce without even bothering to mix them together. Lastly for breakfast I was served the main dish, a yogurt an a roll. That is alright but I would have wished for some fruit to be served along with it like other airlines do. The service is good but when the staff accidentally bumps into you or spills something they just pretend like nothing happened.

Lufthansa (And Frankfurt airport) in general is a great airline to fly, with good planes, well maintained, great staff, clean, courteous, and efficient operations. The challenge is their digital experience.  For an airline this large, I am shocked at how bad their web sites and APPS are. The speed is so slow that I feel I am back in the days of dial-up service. They seem to have layered so many pages on top of one another, that when you click on a button, you wait 10 to 15 seconds for the next page to load. Then, when you think you have it loaded, some other layer loads on top, and moves the screen so you have to search for what you were just doing. I recently booked a simple flight from Frankfurt to Valencia, and it took me over 30 minutes to book online. I then tried the APP - couldn't eventually book it in the APP because I kept getting kicked out.

It's poorly designed, requires extremely long and awkward walks and transits between terminals, poor signage, massive queues, inadequate staffing, incompetent and rude security and border police personnel.

Sure, there is no PE class on connecting flights, and the distances between gates in FRA are quite long, but I did not see these as major issues. The basic product LH offered really worked for me. The fundamental issue was whether the extra cost for PE is worth it. After seeing that the incremental cost above economy was significant, I would say that it is not worth it. Extra leg room, food served on china, and an amenity kit are, in my book, not worth hundreds of dollars. I realize others may see this differently, but I could not justify the extra cost.

We feel that premium economy is really what ordinary economy should be like â you shouldnât have to jam yourself in to ever tighter spaces, but todayâs aircraft are getting worse in that regard.

The check-in was ok (this time the BUD 2A terminal was totally empty, nobody was at the LH business check-in desk), the fast track security was ok, but the next step, the lounge was not ok. LH uses the Celebi Platinum Lounge at BUD, and the standard is around middle! Food selection is poor, quality is bad, there is no warm food at all, snack and sweet selection is pretty bad too, so I'd say this looks like rather a premium economy level lounge. I don't know if Celebi or LH upgrades or checks this lounge, but it would need a definite upgrade, cause for the business class ticket price, it was a disappointment. The boarding was ok both at BUD and MUC. On board, it is also a bit strange. The seat is not a business seat, it is an economy seat, only the middle seat left empty, but this is the only good thing one can say about LH's biz class seat. No bigger legroom, no bigger recline comparing to economy. The food is ok, there is no warm food, not even for a MUC-OSL route. The dessert was fine though (in fact it was better than the main course), and the tea was served in a ceramic cup. Bread was ok, butter was ok, though there was no hot towel. The pursers on both routes were kind and helpful. The Lufthansa business lounge in MUC was super, that one would have to be copy-pasted to BUD! And of course, it was nice to have the possibility to check-in two baggage (which this time I did) and to go on board with two handbags (which this time I did). All-in-all, nice flights with minor delay in the first leg, professional and efficient crew. If LH keeps on selling business class tickets on these prices, they'll  have to upgrade their services at some segments!

We landed around 2145 in Frankfurt although boarding for my next flight was 2125 (flight at 2210). When I got off the plane I expected there to be ground crew guiding people with connecting flights. But there was none whatsoever and we had to take an airport bus to the terminal. Once we arrived at the terminal no staff to guide us again. We had to run towards our next flight to catch the flight. Once we arrived at the gate for the next flight it was 2221, the guy said was it is closed. I explained I have been delayed by the flight from London. He said you have to exit and get someone to book your hotel and next flight. So we had to walk to the exit again. Once we got outside we were booked a hotel and next flight. We had to wait outside the airport for the shuttle to hotels. It took us 20 mins for the wait. Again no clear instruction which is the right bus. I am not saying it was any of the ground staff's fault as well but I think as a service industry the first thing an employee that represents the whole airline should do is to express empathy. Also the whole process would be made much smoother if only the airline could arrange 1 person at the arrival to say we are not going to make our next flight and it is closed or if we should make a run.

Lufthansa prides themselves to deliver what is called Signature Service in Business Class which means that every Business Class passenger gets assigned a personal flight assistant who is supposed to introduce her/himself to you after boarding. Ours did nothing of that sort. When I asked her, her response was a counter-question whether I would be missing something. Great service attitude indeed. We have been sitting in row 15 on the A380 (upper deck) which is separated by sort of a curtain from rows 10-14 despite all rows are supposed to be Business Class. As a consequence, we were entitled to watch how passengers in rows 10-14 were looked after by their personal flight attendants while we didn't get anything. We felt like being in sort of a second class of Business Class. I don't know whether this is common on LH flights on the A380 but it is unacceptable.  When the service finally started, we found out that other passengers got offered a salad between the started and the main course while we again heard nothing about it.

The kiosk wouldn't accept this number so I went to the Lufthansa desk and they redirected me to check in 320. I walked down to 320 and it was cordoned off by the blue barrier tape. There was a check in line next to 320 and it was Lufthansa economy check in, ok good. I get in this long line and wait. After 30 minutes I realize the sign says ""family check in"". I'm next though, so I thought I will ask the check in lady where to go. The airport is packed and there were no helpers at the kiosk area, I have no idea who else to ask. The check in lady summons me forward and I approach the desk. I ask her how to enter the confirmation number with an asterisk. She ignores my question and asks where my family is. I tell her I'm flying alone, my confirmation number doesn't work at the kiosk, the Lufthansa desk is taped off, and I cannot find any airport helpers to ask. She informs me this is the family line, and ""there are signs everywhere for me to read"". I apologize. I ask again how to enter the confirmation number with an asterisk and she ignores me again.

Firstly at the start of my trip, I almost missed my flight to Denmark from Frankfurt as my flight from Heathrow (Lufthansa) was delayed which made me have to run through the airport to catch the last bus to my flight (I must also add that I have asthma and needed to constantly use my inhaler during the process of running to catch my flight. On my return from Denmark to London I experienced yet another delayed flight except this time it was from Denmark to Frankfurt. By the time we were meant to be boarding the plane, it had only just landed. Once we touched down in Frankfurt it was already time to board my next flight to Heathrow. Other flights had a minibus to take them directly to their next flight, however, Heathrow did not. The gate for Heathrow was announced once we landed which we were told it was B41, this was a gate change from the initial gate which was B20. Once we had finally got off the bus, I and a few others had rushed out following the correct signage. I eventually made it to B41 which I was then told that the gate has moved to B47 which I then had to rush off to. I think that this is extremely unacceptable as this is now the second occurrence in the space of 4 days, and I am sure that this didnât just happen on the 2 days that I experienced it, this is a continuous occurrence and something needs to be done to eliminate or even minimize this issue. Also, the only reason I managed to make it to my flight back to Heathrow was that it was delayed.",Economy Class,1,1,1,,1,no,1455,A320,Business,Billund to Heathrow via Frankfurt,June 2019,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

When I asked for a drink before dinner I was denied with the explanation ""we will be serving drinks shortly"". After food was served, the flight attendants vanished and could not be summoned.

Early check-in was important to us because we wanted to get seats on the first row to be able to leave plane ASAP to catch another flight because we had 50 min between flights. So we were proactive and wanted to do the best. In the airport representative of Turkish airlines was surprised that FB client support were not able to check-in and told us that customer service people can see another booking number which was needed to check in (clients are not able to see). I am not angry that situations like this happens, I am angry that nobody from Turkish Airlines wants to listen customer experience and move even one finger to improve they processes and client service. And day by day everything goes worst. Instead of asking to share feedback and send to responsible people to take a look what is wrong everyone is shaking heads. So my try to share my experience in Istanbul airport was unsuccessful. At least I was able to check in and we got seats in the 8 row. But luggage was sent instead of Poznan to Munich. Probably she had already feeling that we will not reach Poznan tonight? Lucky we saw that on time and we asked them to redirect our luggage to Poznan. And for sure the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Munich was later then planned. We asked flight attendants if they can contact people on the gate and ask to wait. We asked passengers in the plane to let us go first to be faster. When we reached the bus to go to another terminal we asked bus driver if he would be able to contact gate and ask to wait 5 min (because we had to wait 5 min for bus schedule). Answer was no we cant so we had to wait. When reached Terminal number 2 we ran as crazy (maybe somebody could explain me why?). And I came to the gate 6 min late, and plane was still there. I was not allowed in. Now time to look for the hotel in all city (closest Hilton is fully booked), because even this is my responsibility.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,1484,,Couple Leisure,Istanbul to Poznan via Munich,July 2019,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

We put in a damage claim and the staff were very helpful helping us to find a wheelchair repairer ( which we could not despite 5 people searching) Luckily we were staying in a town with one nearby but they could not repair it, so we had huge cost to freight it home and more cost to buy a new one.

2019-07-25,"""would not be my first choice""",2,"â Trip Verified |  Copenhagen to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. I have found Lufthansa becoming more and inconsistent in their performance. On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team. I was for instance able to get off the plane before almost all premium passengers. In conclusion, not Lufthansa's finest day, by far. Would I fly them again?

I have chosen this airline for many years as a family friendly airline and for its reputation. Unfortunately when I traveled this time it was a total disaster leading me to write this review. I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference. I also want to add that in Boston at the check-in I was charged an extra $60 USD for my daughters check-in baggage.

The 'chef d'Escale' in Marseille told us that we could not board our flight even just to Munich and that she could not offer any other alternative solution. Lufthansa made us miss our flight letting us stranded in Marseille. We had no other option than to cancel our flight and book a last minute flight with another airline since that was not an option from Lufthansa. As a result we had to stay in Marseille for another 24 hours, rent a new car for the 24hours and arrange to stay another night for the 5 of us in Marseille.",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,1519,,Family Leisure,Marseille to Hong Kong via Munich,August 2019,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Transfer between flights was an stressful experience even travelling on business, despite knowing we were late no assistance was provided to facilitate the transfer; I was taken to the terminal by bus to find my way through immigration (thankfully e-gates were working) and to reach the boarding gate just on time to board the second and final bus (in cramped condition). Hardly time to visit the toilet and certainly not opportunity to go into the Lounge. At the boarding gate I asked about my luggage and I was reassured by the staff, after checking the computer, that it had been transferred successfully to the second plane. After boarding the plane, lunch time, we were informed that there was no catering service at all due to the recurrent issue that they have had .. for over 2 months now. But being served just a wafer is totally unacceptable, they didn't make even the effort to get us a sandwich despite departing from their main hub. Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid. I had to beg then for having it express delivered on that night (only Senators and HON members are entitled to such privilege) despite being Star Alliance Gold and Lufthansa Frequent Flyer. Fortunately the staff took pity of me and they managed to get it approved by Lufthansa. Needless to say that I sent the feedback form to customer services on the very same night. I requested for someone to call me as soon as possible. Instead, I have today (6 days later) the standard sympathetic email with the meaningless apology and the 'great' news that they will credit me with 10K miles and hope to see me on board again.

Now, before I took this flight with my dog I made sure the flight will be the most comfortable as possible for her. The rules are that dogs can fly in cabin as long as they are secured in their carrier during take off and landing and when the seatbelt light goes off the dog is allowed to sit in your lap. I asked the rules several times before traveling because she hates being in a carrier and goes crazy barking and crying. I even got her tranquilizers from the vet just for her to be able to deal with those few minutes she has to be in the carrier. This is the way we traveled to Europe a few weeks ago. Nice and smooth she made it thru.  Lufthansa banned me from flying their airline because my dog, who came out of her carrier by poking her head out, mid flight and was barking! This pilot demanded At the beginning of the flight to keep her in the carrier the whole flight and told me that that is the rules. My poor dog hates being in the carrier, I probably wouldâve not brought her if that was really the rule because she barks and cries when sheâs in the carrier. I asked the pilot why he would not use his own discretion with his rules, for my dog will make the whole plane crazy by barking while being locked in a small box. Itâs the rules.  I did what he told me anyway and my dog barked for 25 minutes straight while I apologized to the other passengers. So we landed in Frankfurt to catch our connecting flight to Miami and the stewardess told me that we cannot board the plane.

LH appears to be losing its discipline when it comes to on time boarding and departures. On board, the hard product offered decent space for oneâs belongings but the fact that not every seat has direct aisle access remains a downside for LH business class. The seat offers limited privacy and the fact that it is angled towards the neighbour, makes it quite awkward in the fully flat position as a mere 1 inch divider separates the respective foot wells. The seat was narrow compared to business class seats found on other carriers. It was not particularly comfortable in the lie flat position. The service was in typical LH fashion, efficient but lacking warmth. The food and wine offerings were quite good however, the salad consisted of limp mesclun greens and was sort of thrown onto the tray. The snack served prior to landing was actually better tasting than the lunch offering consisting of a delicious soup and very tasty prawns. The IFE had a good selection and I especially enjoyed the cameras showing the exterior of the aircraft. The toilets were kept in immaculate condition throughout the flight.

2019-10-10,"""Senator Lounge is in free fall""",6,"â Trip Verified | I flew from Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt on 6 October in Business Class. The Senator Lounge in Berlin is in free fall. There was a lot of talk about the new Senator Lounge. In the end, the new one is worse than the old one. The choice of food and drinks is very limited. For breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. The croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. There is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. Shame on Lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the German capital. The departure from Berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. However, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. As I was in a good position overlooking the apron, I knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in Frankfurt. The aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. In Business Class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. For me, there was enough connecting time in Frankfurt, as I knew exactly how I could get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 quickly. I spent some 20 minutes in the Senator Lounge. It was quite empty for that time of day. The food served reflected the fact that the Oktoberfest in Munich had started. It was all very Bavarian â the same you get in the Munich lounges all year round. Within the 50 minutes I was in Frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from B30 to B20 to B27 and finally to B28. The flight from Frankfurt to Tivat was the real disappointment. The flight was more than twice as long as the inner-German flight from Berlin to Frankfurt, but the food served on board to Tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. I mean how is this possible? How can it be that Lufthansa â a so-called 5-star airline â offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? Frankfurt is Lufthansaâs main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. Is that the impression Lufthansa tries to leave? Austrian, a Lufthansa-group member, is able to serve a hot meal on all international flights no matter how long it is. Why is the parent company, Lufthansa, not able (or willing?) to do the same?",Business Class,1,1,1,,1,yes,1551,A320/A319,Couple Leisure,Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt,October 2019,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

When we arrived at the check in they said they had overbooked and if we could volunteer to go on another flight (KLM) leaving at the same time. I figured no harm so I ran to the other side of the airport only to be told by KLM that we had not been booked on that flight and that the gate was closed. So we had to run back all the way to Lufthansa to then be told they could get us on our original flight. In form of âcompensationâ they offered us â¬250 each and put us up in a hotel with a shuttle bus from the airport. But like the previous promise of another flight, the shuttle was non existent so we ended up paying for taxis out of pocket. Next day when we arrived early to follow the given instructions about the compensation once again, no one knew anything and everything they told us was wrong. The only thing we could do was file a claim online. Of course this is a very convenient way of not dealing with customers. I called and was told if I wanted to make a reservation of course I could talk to someone, but if I have a complaint that can only be done online, nice way of avoiding responsibility and not facing your many unhappy passengers. We filed the claims, I sent all the required emails and have received no reply. I am very frustrated with what I consider to be lies and lack of responsibility. Why should I have to miss my flight and pay â¬70 because they overbooked? So claims filed, and still no reply.

To be short, the service was terrible. Stewards never offered to warm bottles, never bothered to check or ask how we were doing and when we did ask for some hot water it was given very abruptly. After only 2.5hrs of a 9.5 hour flight the cabin lights were turned off completely. This was not a red eye flight so I have no idea why this was done. When I got up to stretch and stand I was told within 2 minutes to go and sit down by the rudest stewardess I have ever encountered. She also badgered other passengers throughout the flight. There was also no safety briefing at the start of the flight and all the announcements were so garbled you couldnât understand what they were saying, in German or English. There was no offer of assistance while de-planing and no offer of assistance in regards to where we go next for our next flight. Once we arrived in Frankfurt we were almost run over (literally) by a golf cart doing at least 15-20mph! We had to walk almost 2km to get to out next gate and when we went to the Lufthansa service desk for directions there was no one around (of course).

Over an hour after landing, we had missed our flight. The girl on the customer service desk arranged for us to get our luggage back and  gave us a cursory apology for any inconvenience.

Soon after take off, unlike some other European airlines, a pastry snack and drink was swiftly served. Service, was formal, non-engaging, but quite adequate. However, on landing we had to be moved to a far away parking slot and it incurred a long bus ride, and further rail ride to the actual allocated terminal area.

Once the bar service was opened, I opted for a scotch on ice, but with a half litre bottle opened, I got a very small drink served! That was followed by a tasty lunch, wine, and I settled down to watch a movie on the IFE. The choice here is a very limited (compared to the likes of Emirates). On my return flight, which was late night, the service started with drinks and a delicious beef sandwich. 90 minutes before arrival a bland breakfast was served consisting of omelet and cold items. The seating on Premium Economy is very comfortable (2x3x2). The usual water bottle and small amenity kit was also provided. But as I was at a window seat, stepping out to use the toilet was difficult, especially as the passenger in the front seat had his seat reclining.

As it was a midday flight, a cold lunch/snack and warm bread was served, along with drinks. Comfort wise, there is no difference between Economy and Business seats. The seat pitch is the same, and though the empty middle seat offers more space, considering this is just an hour flight, it did not make any difference.

I started to call the Lufthansa customer service with no success, and I have proceeded to call the Austrian air. I ended up calling the Senator Lufthansa service, due to the status of my uncle, hoping to get some help from their side. After approx. 1h 30min on the phone I finally got connected to an English-speaking gentleman who apparently decided to help me. IÂ´ve asked him what the solution would have been and he didnÂ´t have any information regarding it, therefore as I had to go back to Vienna due to work business I asked him to rebook me to any flight within the star alliance airlines, and he mentioned just the possibility to fly via Brussels, although there was still a spare place via Zurich with SWISS. I received an Email confirmation with my flight to Belgium with Brussels airlines and proceeding with an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna. I wanted to check- in online but on Brussels airlines it was not possible, but for the flight with AUA yes. I was a bit concerned, but I thought due to the strike this could have been normal. I arrived a bit earlier to the airport and at the check-in counter by giving them my documents their answer was âwe donÂ´t have any flight booked under your nameâ I was very furious as it was looking like there would have not been any solution to fly back on that day. I had to talk to other three people, until someone could have started helping me out for it, the only supervisor for five star alliance in an international airportâ¦ ridiculous, and neither from the airline but from the group S.A.V.E., company operating in Venice airport. They had to call several times, many Lufthansa desks until they told me they would have had to rebook me on a flight via Zurich (the one IÂ´ve seen the day before, but which was never offered to meâ¦) It was a kind of realizing news they gave me, although I was stuck at the airport for about 4 hours as it was way much earlier my scheduled flight to Brussels.

They donât think itâs their problem that we donât have our luggage. Reminder that weâre not just in a foreign country, but in Egypt. We have a body guard assigned to us from the Egyptian government to escort us whenever we leave our hotels. âGo buy some essentials and weâll refund you 50% of the cost.â First off, even refunding me 100% of the cost is not enough to even begin to cover this inconvenience. Thereâs clothes, snacks, and other items in my luggage that I bought specifically for this trip that Iâve now bought in vain because I will never use them.  I saved up money, which is precious right now during the pandemic, to come here and enjoy myself! If my luggage was delivered to me in a timely fashion, I wouldnât have been able to relax and enjoy myself rather than almost have a breakdown.

There was also a family who wore masks so evidently inadequate (they looked like gaiters for the neck) that a flight attendant offered them surgical ones, but they were allowed to refuse these masks and continue on board! Lufthansa has to do much, much better if they really are committed to protecting their customers (and their employees!). I know it is difficult for the crew to control everything that goes on during a flight, but to be blunt, it is their responsibility and they failed their costumers who followed the rules (doing everything to avoid infecting and getting infected) miserably.

This when the exchange between us got heated and and there was raising of voices despite the fact that there were other customers in the queue. Eventually she told me that there is nothing she can do and waved me off.

2021-06-12,"""I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect""",3,"â Trip Verified | This is the first time I flew with Lufthansa with family. I chose Lufthansa for a number of reasons, mainly reputation, route, price, and recommendations by others. I must say I was extremely disappointed. Terrible infotainment system - slow and clunky. Terrible economy seats - they recline but the seat pad does not move forward like others airlines such as Emirates, Turkish, Ethiopian, etc. Many rude flight attendants. Unsurprising given most are German, but still, should be more pleasant. No meal choices. Every other airline I have ever flown has offered at least some food choice ~ meat, chicken, fish, etc. Not Lufthansa! It was pasta with tomato sauce and wasn't even tasty. I sent emails to the Lufthansa customer relations department. Here is the context of my email. We traveled from Frankfurt to Johannesburg on flight LH572, departing on June 3 at 22.05, which lasted approximately 10 Â½ hours. During this time, we experienced disrespect, rudeness, and overall unpleasant attitudes and service by some of your flight attendants. We were seated in row 32, seats G, H and K. I understand that food is limited, however, when we inquired if our daughter could have an alternate meal, the female flight attendant blurted out âEveryone has the same thing! If you wanted a special meal, you should have requested it before the flight.â Thatâs fine, but the insensitive and rude behavior of this flight attendant was not acceptable, by any culture! When the plane pulled into the gate at Johannesburg, the fasten seat belt sign was turned off. I stood up to stretch my legs as I am tall and my knees hurt. Again, this flight attendant shouted at me to âsit down until you are told to get up!â Is this the type of behavior that is tolerated by your airline? Based on reactions from other passengers on this flight, I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect, almost disdain, by some of your flight attendants, as I was not the only passenger she yelled at. Received only a ""canned"" response to my inquiry.

The day before the flight on July 24th, I went online to do my check in and just want to make sure everything is okay then I noticed Lufthansa had cancelled my flight without booking me another flight back to the US, meanwhile, I paid for round trip. So I spent last day of my vacation 4 hours on the phone trying to solve this issue. First, itâs so hard to find a valid number to call Lufthansa for customer service. When we finally found a number to call, then it says they only work Monday to Friday. Long story short, I finally was able to rebook my flight for July 25th at 9.10AM. Boarding is so slow and inefficient. We were supposed to leave at 9.10AM but we did not leave until 9.40AM due to slow boarding. I originally paid/ booked premium economy seat, while they rebook me they downgrade my seat to regular economy. Then I have a connection flight from frankfurter to JFK at 11.00AM. While in the air I asked a crew member that I have connection flight if I can still make it and she said yes, if I ran. I ran through the immigration and I asked the guy who worked at the immigration again if he thinks I can make it then he told me he doesnât think so because of the gate is very far, the farthest gate itâll take me about 10+ mins if I run (Z68). When I finally ran to the gate, airline employees told me the boarding has closed. I missed my flight while my other fellow American who ran with me said while they were told this connection flight will wait for us. Then we were told there is no more flight out to NY JFK anymore for the day. We can either wait until tomorrow or go to Newark NJ. (But my car is parked at JFK long term parking). Then we have to go to another gate (Z12) to the counter in order to rebook our flight. Anyway, so I took that flight at 1:20PM (again they put me in regular economy while I paid for premium economy). Because of the whole chaos that Lufthansa put me through now I end up in Newark. So I have to figure out an Uber home or arrange pick up by friends while I have my own car parked at JFK where I booked my final destination to.

The first passport control (8 minutes away) line had about 4 windows open with about 30 people in each line. I asked one of the staff that I have a flight leaving very soon and I will miss it, is there anyway I can get to the front of the line, she said you have to wait.

I waited in line for about 5 minutes and then was allowed through. I ran to my gate and arrived at 8:50am. I handed the lady at the gate desk my boarding pass and she simply said..

My wife and I bought tickets for a 10 Day trip to Scotland this year in June to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We originally booked with British Airways. Due to the COVID 19 outbreaks, the trip was canceled by the travel company. British Airways promptly refund our money because we cannot get into the country. The trip company off to rebook us again in August, and because of limited routes, we booked the second air trip with Lufthansa instead. Unfortunately, Scotland did not open this August either. I made numerous attempts to contact Customer Service at Lufthansa, but to no avail. I was force to cancel my tickets online, but they only refunded a small portion of the taxes despite the fact they cannot even take me to Scotland.  I am currently out over $7,000 dollars because these were business class tickets that we saved up to purchase. I will never take this airline again.

However, Lufthansa does not allow rebooking online if your flight gets cancelled or there are complications due to coronavirus. Moreover, if there is a government-imposed travel ban, they will not allow you to have refund (only rebooking, usually at a very high price because the last-minute booking is usually twice or three times the price of the original ticket). Other flight companies allow for refund, but Lufthansa is instructing their call service to deny the refunds and rebooking cannot be done online. To rebook, you need to call their call service, which is a nightmare. I tried to rebook 3 times. First time I was on hold for about an hour. Then, I explained the situation, was put on hold, and after 1 hour of waiting was disconnected from the line. This same thing happened 3 times.

After the trip I had contacted Lufthansa about 25 times over the phone and just about as many through their email and social media. I requested a refund back in may and was told I will receive money back in 7-10 days. I called back 3 weeks after and they was no idea what refund I was talking about, they stated that there was no ticket for a refund on my account. It took me 3 hours and 4 attempts to get a hold of a live person, since the first 3 either hung up, or put me on a 30 min hold and then hung up, the representative that work for this company have zero respect for customers time and money. I always asked very politely to not disconnect the call and to call me in case we get disconnected. Not a singe Lufthansa representative called me back after hanging up on me.

The A320 to Frankfurt was new and spotless. The crew went around handing out a single alcohol towelette to each passenger in a great display of hygiene/safety precautions (other airlines give you masks, gel, wipes, etc). Each passenger was given an individual bottle of mineral water  and Swiss-style chocolates. That was it, for an early evening flight. On the FRA-HKG leg, there was no choice of dish for dinner or the usual apology of ""sorry, we have run out of"" -  some penne in tomato sauce. Breakfast was very skimpish and un-German (picture).

The adventure began already in the night before the flight when I tried to check-in my daughter electronically. This was not successful, because electronic check-in of LH asks whether or not a visa is available. In an exchange program, there is no visa, however, but an ""application approval"" and the visa is issued at the local airport upon arrival. Such a possibility is, unfortunately, not available within the electronic check-in at LH and electronic check-in could, therefore, not be performed. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. As soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. However, only an electronic check-in was possible there. This check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. Therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. After a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. Although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. When she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. Despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines I have experience with close their gates just before departure, LH refused to accept my daughter. Lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also LH has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. Not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of LH. All in all, I consider this procedure unacceptable. Two days before departure, I wanted to clarify one more point with LH and called LH's information desk at 23:00. According to the information on LHÂ´s website, the support line is open until midnight. The announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. Since the clarification was important to me, I decided to wait. After waiting until 23.50, I hung up.

The queue was endless and moving in the slowest possible pace. Things looked quite scary, so I opted to go directly to business class check in with my Turkish frequent flyer card (unsure whether eligible for that). After some 25 min of wait (at business class line folks) I was checked in and given tags for my carry-on.  Boarding was a mess. Calling passengers by groups (to lessen physical contact I guess) gate agents then asked everyone to form a standing queue near the gate door within a small space providing close physical contact. Then the gate door opened, so people were able to board, and without airline staff guidance things got back to normal. Onboard it was ok. The seat back recline has been eliminated since new A320NEO came to fleet, so seat comfort is now not on par with low cost carriers. A bottle of water and wet napkins were handed out. We took off and landed on time. Disembarkation in Munich also went by groups. It slowed things down, but not badly. Then boarding flight to Kyiv was another stupid quest. Without any announcement all the passengers were re-directed to another gate. There instead of boarding we had to get our boarding passes stamped. But with stamped boarding passes instead of boarding the plane we were diverted to the initial gate where they were trying to enforce boarding by groups ignoring the fact that stamping passports was not done by groups, so they were finally able to form quite a big disorganized crowd. Boarding took forever and some more covid infection was spread in this interesting way. Onboard it was uneventful.

On short flights it were often just a few bites very nicely presented which gave you the feeling to be a well treated guest by them (and you also always paid the high price for it). On the most recent short haul flights I took with Lufthansa I was shocked the food served in business class has been downgraded while ticket prices are as high or even higher as ever before. The food served on my business class flights were uninspired tasteless sandwiches. They looked similar to the sandwiches Lufthansa used to serve in Economy until a few months ago. If this is their strategy to attract full fare paying guests in Business they really got it wrong. Itâs an absolute disgrace for people paying so much money expecting a standard above average. If this is the new Lufthansa I may as well consider flying low cost for my next flights and just pay for food sold on board.

The free flight change would only cover flights to the same destination within 7 days of the initial booking dates. If I would like to reschedule for January onwards, I would have to pay 1100 Euro per passenger.

2021-11-08,"""overhead bin filled up quickly"" ",5,"Not Verified |Â Â The first leg BER-FRA was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft. The flight is completely full and the boarding was chaotic without much prioritisation of the Group number. Most passengers brought along huge cabin luggage. The gate staff announced to encourage passengers to check their bags free of charge, but they didnât go out of their way to pick some obviously large and oversized bags. Once onboard, the overhead bin filled up quickly. Cabin crew were standoff-ish, saying that it was not their job to facilitate the space arrangement.  The flight was further delayed because passengers continued to run up and down the aisle to find space. Once arrived in Frankfurt, there was nobody at the gate to facilitate connecting passengers, so everyone ran for themselves. My second flight FRA-LHR was also further delayed for unknown reasons. Upon boarding, I was told to go to another gate staff to have my documents checked for COVID & locator form etc. The other staff  refused to do it because it wasnât her duty, whilst the one holding that duty was nowhere to be found. Once onboard, again, similar situation with the overhead bin space reoccurred, but this time the male steward were slightly more hands-on than the previous flight, but they still could do more. This trip wasnât the first time I encountered LH cabin crew staffâs attitude towards assistance with the overhead bin space. Since before COVID, Iâve gradually switched from BA to LH as my preferred full-service airline, but the LH cabin crew attitude is making me think twice on my future flights, especially LH has now scaled down the inflight catering whilst BA started to offer some free stuff

On 13-14th of July, 2021 my family and I had to fly Lufthansa Miami - Frankfurt - Kyiv with 2 month old baby, but our flight from Miami delayed for 2+ hours because of weather conditions, we missed our next flight, so, in Frankfurt we asked to give us any flight even through other Germany city, just to get home faster at the same day, so, we've got such a flight with extra city. We were so much tired, with a so little baby, so many and hard flights. At that (third) city (i don't remember which exactly, it was just for transition), we were already exhausted. We forgot my small bag at the airplane with my phone, documents, bank cards, money ut already couldn't return for it. I was in panic, cause in 1.5h we had another flight, to Kyiv. I, with a little baby on my hands, saw an airport crew guy - Mr Lenz, told him about my trouble. Truth be said I didn't think he can help, i thought he sends me to the special service for finding things  as most are doing.. But he said: don't worry, take care of your kids, I will get it for you. I was very happy. The airplane already wasn't at the place, Cristian did real magic and found that my bag before our next flight. I appreciate it so much! I even don't know what we would do, especially with 2 month old baby, who was already very tired. I'm so grateful this Person for His heart and willing to help.

Coffee and probably some snacks you can buy from them - thatâs how it works now. In general, food service is a disgrace and the flight attendants are polite but very abrupt. With their masks on, they are like robots - gone is all the niceness and kindness and good humour. All they care about is that your mask is covering your nose properly at all times.

From what I can see on the Lufthansa tracking on their site the baggage was sent on 28.12.2021 from Vienna to Malta, and then for some unknown reason from Malta to Frankfurt - however, Malta Airport is reporting the luggage never even landed in Malta. Since then I have had to contact Lufthansa who claims there is no report even made, I have called Frankfurt Airport, Vienna Airport, and Copenhagen Airport to try and get some assistance, I have been passed around and have to communicate with Central Baggage Services and World Tracker â this is beyond infuriating and also just simply unfair as Lufthansa should be able to at the very least guide me in what to do and see where the error happened.

I had a long argument with the agent who nearly refused to issue my boarding passes although I had all the necessary documents with me (and no problem at all at immigration in Dubai later). Flight from Berlin to Munich on time, but otherwise nothing to praise about it. Lufthansa has introduced a buy on board service on domestic and European flights, but they didn't offer anything on this flight, so even if I had wanted, I couldn't get a coffee or snack. Munich airport is very easy to transfer, but repeated document checks at the gate resulted in a delayed departure. First time flying in Lufthansa's premium economy, and while I liked the seat comfort and additional space, it's disappointing that the service has been reduced to exactly the same as in regular economy, apart from a tiny glass of juice after boarding. They also cut the nuts or crackers with the first drink round, and they now serve coffee or tea together with the meal. That doesn't make any sense as your coffee will be cold once you have finished the meal.

On a long-haul flight of about 13.5 hours from Singapore to Frankfurt, only one proper meal was served with no option of any kind of dish having meat in it. A bland vegetable penne pasta with a 1.5 x 1.5-inch sized piece of brownie and that is pretty much it. They did not serve any kind of mid-meal snacks as they did not have any in the first place and the air-hostess stated this upfront that ""we do not serve any kind of snacks on this flight"".

Over the years I have traveled numerous times on Lufthansa and Iâm sad to say that this time around, Lufthansa did not live up to its reputation of being Europeâs 5 star airline. The meal choice was poor (only veggie pasta on both legs) and the service of the crew left much to be desired. It seems like the lack of customer service just gets blamed on Covid. Worst of all was the terrible spacing/leg room in economy class. It is big enough for a 10 year old kid but not for a normal size adult. It really felt like the airline wanted to cramp in more passengers to make up for the losses incurred during the pandemic without any regard to the comfort of passengers. On the second leg of our journey we even wanted to upgrade to premium economy or business class but turns out since the FRA-JHB route is so busy, both flights were fully booked. As a Miles and More member I was deeply disappointed. I usually donât complain about airlines and Iâm not pleased I even had to write this one. However, comparing the passenger comfort and the customer service of Lufthansa to that of the middle eastern airlines, or even other European airlines, it really makes me question whether I should fly Lufthansa ever again.

What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime. Almost any other full service airline would have provided some sort of food service. It is already low cost carrier like to only have paid food services.

Late departure, cramped seats, underseat storage was only 3 half-size slots for 4 people (not big enough for a regular size backpack), none of our bags fit, the entertainment system was exceedingly slow and crashed 5 times leading to a blank screen. The flight attendants ignored the call button, I rang it 4 times in 30 minutes and they never peaked out from behind the curtain, I could hear them chatting on the other side, there were numerous other call lights illuminated in the cabin - all went unattended. When I arrived at the transfer airport, they shuttled us all onto our new flight only to wait several hours on the tarmac before telling us that the flight was cancelled. When we were returned to the terminal, the line to speak to customer service was about 500 people long. I waited in line for an hour before an airline employee came and told a large group of us that there was another service desk on the other side of the terminal with no line. He led us all the way across the terminal only to find that the line was easily twice as long. I ended up waiting in the new line for another 2 hours. When I finally got to the front, I was told there was only 1 seat left on any flight on any airline to my destination within 48 hrs, it left 31 hours after my original flight and I had to take it now or leave it.

We initially tried to book through Air Canada with this flight, but were informed that as we are travelling with a pet we need to call Lufthansa directly. Everything seemed fine and I gave my debit card details to the operator and was told I'd receive my booking confirmation within 72hrs. After 1 week I didn't receive anything, so I called again and this operation took my card information as if he was booking me another ticket, again I was assured I will receive the booking confirmation within 72hrs. Another week passes and I've received nothing (we can all see the pattern here!), so I call again. This operator told me that the payment couldn't go through as it was a Visa Debit card, so my partner gave her credit card and the payment went through in the time frame or so we thought! We still haven't received a confirmation for our pet in cabin. We call again (several times) to get a confirmation that our pet would be joining us on the flight, we were given 4 different responses, but always promised the confirmation will arrive by tomorrow or 48hrs or 72hrs (depending on who we spoke to). One month passes by and we give up and decide to leave it up to chance arriving with our pet at the airport with the hopes we can take him. But it doesn't end there, about 1.5 months after booking our flights I receive another booking confirmation email for the same flight and the price was taken from my account. So I call and cancel that flight and received a refund of the full amount. I know what your thinking ""It must end here!"", think again. On the day I received my refund I had two more transactions taken from my account, totaling the amount that I was just refunded! In our preparation to move to another continent, I had missed these transactions coming from my account. So the night before my flight, as I was checking in, I noticed and I called explaining my story to the operator, she was no help at all as we were trying to figure out this issue. The call then dropped. Calling back again I got another operator and at this point I wanted to speak to someone with more knowledge, so I asked for the manager. He told me this isn't possible and that he can help me, I expressed that I have called about a dozen times to simply get a flight for 2 people and a pet, I've been booked on the same flight twice and charged three times. At this point I just wanted to speak to someone with a bit more experience. I was put on hold and told it wasn't possible for him to do that, but he did direct me to their website to request a refund, (I mean come on, that's the best you can do, submit a refund for a flight that I've already cancelled?). I thank him for and submit the form, but there was nowhere to upload the documents. So I called again, explained the situation to another person and I was giving an email to send my bank statements to and now I wait!

The first meal consisted of a salad of carrot, squash and aubergine, a roll, a cake with raisins, and a dry pasta with some tomato sauce. Initially, I thought that as the plane was full and I was at the back of the plane that this was the left over option. It transpires that there is only one option and it is vegetarian which doesn't bother me but might others. The pasta was pretty horrible and really felt like something a student might make. Just past and a bit of tomato sauce. the salad was small and bland. The roll and cake were fine. The second meal (breakfast) was a yoghurt a cereal bar and a dry sandwich (also vegetarian). Beer and wine are complimentary but spirits are not and come in at about 7 euros. No snacks or nuts with the drink service though you can buy them. The seat was fine, the entertainment system was difficult to use and had an average selection. The second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda which was around 15 hours due to closed Russian airspace was in airbus. The plane was new and clean and the entertainment system was easier to operate. However the food and drink situation was the same. In fact the same nasty pasta was served this time accompanied by a couple of chopped up lettuce leaves. breakfast was the same too. I really felt that for 15 hours on a plane there wasn't much food.

The flight was delayed by a total of 1 hour, leading to a missed connection in Frankfurt. When boarding commenced in Oslo, no dedicated priority boarding was given, there were also no announcements for preboarding disabled flyers or families with small children. Once onboard, staff did not greet us, but directly inquired about the seat row. We found the seat area in business class poorly cleaned and with visible traces of spilled drinks from the previous flight. No welcome drink was served, as is usually the case on Lufthansa. Once airborne, we were served a sausage salad, which was one of the most appalling airline meals Iâve ever had. As dessert we were offered an apple in a paper bag, which we declined. Drinks were served out of synch with the food - here as well the service standards were poor, as all drinks were served lukewarm (including the sparkling wine).

For drinks they offered some juices, water, wine. The morning omelette was more or less ok, tomato near raw and cold, piece of bread was hard to bite. Also staff were very rude to me.

They just cancelled my ticket without notifying me. Of course, they would not hear anything or try to find a solution. ""We're sorry"" was all they could say. The return flight from Rennes to Frankfurt on June 18th? Also cancelled. The worst is yet to come: the client service is incredibly bad. No one can give me a precise answer or find a solution. No rebooking or refund is being made. They told me the ""no-show"" is automatically cancelling the other flights, but why not put it clearly somewhere? Why not send an email?

The app is also not of assistance. If you want to upgrade your seats, the service desk is not able to assist or they claim everything is sold out but ask people to keep an eye for availabilities. We naturally did this, and last minute upgraded our seats, only to realize that they sell it nearly for free in the airport - this to advise that we tried to upgrade to business via phone but was told that it was sold out. In the airport they sold business cheaper than we had bought premium economy seats at the day before. Business was nearly empty on the flight and we were not allowed to upgrade in the airport, despite wanting to pay for same, as you can only upgrade once. When boarding we were shocked to see the seats, as the pictures of the class on their web is absolutely not picturing what you actually get. On the return flight, we again wanted to upgrade, as one of the ticket holders got injured and upgraded to business by the insurance company. We managed to upgrade the rest of us to prem eco only to find out, than in 3 weeks they had removed the ""all incl"" in the prem eco, hence limited avails of the drinks (both soft and alch). This wasn't even mentioned while being upgraded. Entertainment on board is very limited or not working. Very few movies, games platform not working at any of the flights and the wifi was not working on any of the flights. The food back from Mexico was not edible - and we are really not having high thoughts for food on board a flight - but when you pay a fortune to get food on board, then you should at least be served food which is being well cooked in order to eat it. Pancakes served for breakfast was not even fried enough to be able to eat it.

However, once we got there after waiting in a 35 minute line for customer service, we were simply told this is the wrong line and to walk âthat wayâ toward the double doors. In an airport that big, you think they could give better directions but no. Then once again, we asked for more directions and their ambiguity of directions appalled me. However, after searching for the âcorrectâ customer service for half an hour, with little to no help from anyone we found it. They were very accommodating and put us up in a hotel 20 min away from the hotel free of charge. However, we asked if we could get our luggage so we could have our change of clothes, our toiletries, etc, and they werenât able to do anything because âthey were already headed to our final destinationâ which I would have understood. However, as I landed in New York this morning I received a text message that my bag couldnât be loaded on schedule, which leaves the question as to why I couldnât get it in the first place. I was flying home for a surgery for a fractured jaw so I thought Lufthansa would be a bit more accommodating due to that fact, but no. Not at all. So I am now left with no contacts, no toiletries, no clothes and the hassle of having to reschedule doctor appointments and surgery.

2022-06-19,"""I would not wish this kind of stress on my worst enemy""",1,"Not Verified |  Just 4 short years ago I flew on Lufthansa.

I checked in no problem and well you got me to my point of destination with relative ease, my my my, how that has changed. This airline has made my life living hell in just 24 hours. They have screwed me not once, not twice, but about a million times over. Let's break it down. I am going to start with their website. The website is absolutely appalling in terms of navigation, to find any information on the website, you must navigate the entire website dictionary. Not to mention the pages upon pages of useless code (meaning the pages don't work). I will save you some time by giving you a few pages that don't work - The Baggage Calculator, The COVID 19 Related Documents Uploading Page, The login and Sign Up pages, and a ton of the characters and typography. All I can say is whoever is doing the code for the Lufthansa website needs to fired. Let's move on to baggage. For a long-haul flight, I feel like a personal item (a purse or backpack), a carry-on item (a small bag), and a checked bag are acceptable, especially considering the flight was $1,500 USD. But no. Not on Lufthansa, you have to shove everything you need for a 10-hour flight into a single carry-on bag that must weigh under 8kg. I work with technology for a living and what I need for my job alone weighs 8kg. Unfortunately, I will not be able to pack everything I need for the next 2 years into two bags, so I looked for how much it will cost to take 3 bags. There is not a dang thing on the website on how much it costs to check another bag. So I call Lufthansa. Nothing. So I call again. I could not get a hold of any operator or person even within the business hours, nor would they let me wait on the phone for someone. No contact, how convenient Lufthansa. Website flaw, maybe, customer service flaw, absolutely. It is now just 22 hours away from my flight. I currently live 2 hours away from the airport and can I check in for my flight online...nope, I have to check-in at the airport conveniently located nowhere near me. Oh and just so you are aware, the Lufthansa check-in page doesn't work either. All in all, I would not wish this kind of stress on my worst enemy and lord do I hope that you the customer are not flying on Lufthansa because you won't even be able to check-in for your flight.

I will not review the short haul flight between Germany-Czech, because there is nothing to report. I will review the long haul flight Munich-Bangkok. The same review applies also to flight Bangkok Munich, but I lost the boarding pass already. First of all, check ins and boarding were sufficient and good even though the shortage of staff was visible. My main positives is the seat comfort and less noise in the aircraft. The seat was great to spend time in that long and the noise of the aircraft is much lower and therefore I enjoyed the journey very much. Staff attitude was ok. I was little surprised that have to pay for spirits, but I can understand this due to the current economic climate in the world. Mainly because i know that I paid far little money for the tickets then others. The main negative was the food. Please make sure that you eat well before travelling, because what you will get inside the plane is absolutely horrible. Overall experience is that it seems that Lufthansa became sort of a sausage factory.  Basically, get in the plane, smile couple times, get food, sleep and when landed get out.

We were then escorted to a lift/elevator by Lufthansa staff and into the departure lounge which was only about to board when we arrived. We all felt like VIP's but we were only traveling economy class, and I have never encountered this high level of efficiency and slickness on any other airline.

Already a long flight, it was delayed by over an hour to start. Staff were nice and efficient enough, but this plane is =lacking in amenities=. The touch screens were horribly slow and old, and staff said they were =out of wired earbuds. Meaning any of us with airpods were out of luck for the nine hour flight if you wanted to watch a movie. Meals were okay, but the cold sandwich (cheese and veggies) was not good. Our flight ended up being over 11 hours due to a detour in Philly because of thunderstorms. We had to sit on the tarmac while the plane was refueled. They did an okay job of keeping us updated, but none of us appreciated being alerted to the detour literally ten minutes before the detoured landing. All in all, this was a pretty miserable experience.

Seated in front of exit row. No window and no recline seat. Good thing it was only a 1 hour flight. Frankfurt Airport was horrid. Bussed us from remote pad to A terminal. Then had to walk 3/4 mile through A to C terminal, but required to exit secure zone when left terminal A. There was two separate B terminal security lines which were at least 200 yards long. Figured lots of people would miss flights in that terminal The line for C terminal security took around 45 minutes. Although we had a connection time of 1.5 hours we barely made it through security to the C15 gate in time. When going through the boarding ticket scan I was told I had to pay for baggage which I had already paid on check in at Basel. Gate agent had no record of us paying for baggage which would have cost us another $100. I finally reasoned with gate agent that we had already checked bags in Basel and paid the fee in Basel so they finally waived the extra baggage fee. we boarded the plane exhausted and dehydrated from the walk. After walking as fast as we could From A to C, we did not have time to purchase any water because it would be discarded at security in C terminal. we were thinking we would get a bottle of water on the plane. Sat on ground after boarding for another 1/2 hour. No beverage service for at least 30 minutes after take off. No bottle of water, only a half full 6 oz plastic cup. And no ice. Servers skipped us twice during flight and only offered drink service 30 minutes after takeoff, during the meal two hours into flight and two additional times before the ""snack"" during the 11 hour flight. The snack before landing was two pieces of bread and a slice of white cheese. I had to ask the servers for some water twice after being skipped. Seats and legroom seemed smaller than those on Delta.

I have purchased the tickets Vilnius - Frankfurt-am-Main - Halifax with an 8 hours stop at Frankfurt Airport aiming to meet up with friends there and travel further to Canada. Though I checked-in 24 hours before departure it turned out that the flight LH889 was overbooked and app. 20 passengers incl. me were left behind. The airport personnel first asked us to proceed to the gate and wait until departure probably hoping (!) that some places will reveal themselves. But the miracle was not there and 20 unhappy passengers were asked to go to the airport workers to rebook their flights. After 1.5 hour waiting, fortunately, a Vilnius airport employee found a solution for me and managed to rebook the flight to Frankfurt via Amsterdam. So I had to stop at one more airport and spent in the air 2.5 + 1.5 hours (Vilnius - Amsterdam - Frankfurt / Main) instead of around 1 hour 10 min (Vilnius - Frankfurt/Main). I was acceptable as long as I was on time for my connecting flight to Halifax. But the next ""surprise"" was waiting for me in Halifax. My luggage did not arrive. I immediately filed a report at the airport and waited patiently a week as it was agreed with the lost&found service. Since then I regularly write complaints and emails to airports and Lufthansa and receive no feedback at all! Nobody answers the phone either. On top of all these circumstances I had to cancel my fully refundable return ticket due to personal reasons and was shocked by the refunded 80 USD instead of 611 USD.

Upon our plane landing in Munich, the pilot and flight attendant staff instructed us that there are no more flights until tomorrow and to go straight to the Lufthansa service desk to assist us due to our circumstances and missing connections. Once we exited the plane and got into the airport, the Lufthansa Munich service desk immediately made an intercom announcement stating that they are closing their service desk (regardless of a plane full of people just arriving off of a Lufthansa flight with nowhere to go) and told us that there are no hotel rooms available for us, no transportation, no meals and to sleep in the airport.

When I searched on the Lufthansa website to try and book a one way flight back home, I saw that they clearly had multiple flights back home with plenty of seats still available. However, the agent said that those flights were not accessible for me to rebook. At this point it was clear that Lufthansa did not respect me at all.

The staff at the check in counter were unable to help me and I was again told to line up at the rebooking counter. There, after another 4-5 hour wait, I was told that my entire booking had been canceled by the computer system because it had considered me missing my initial connecting flights as a âno showâ. In addition to canceling my booking the computer system had also surrendered the seats I had been rebooked on and these were now unavailable.

Lufthansa had bad communication and customer service during my journey to and from Berlin. When flying to Berlin, my second flight from Munich, Germany to Berlin was cancelled. I was never informed by Lufthansa that my flight was cancelled. A friend that I was traveling with told me that my flight was cancelled. The interesting is that his flight was automatically rebooked and mines wasnât. I had to call customer service and get them to rebook my flight. Traveling to Washington, DC My friend and I found out when we were checking into our flights that we couldnât check in because our flight could potentially be canceled. We later found out that it was cancelled due to employees striking. Once again, when they officially cancelled my friend flight, he was rebooked automatically with another airline. Lufthansa never rebooked my flight or contacted me to tell me my flight was cancelled. After trying to contact them all day, I finally got through and was only able to get my flight rebooked for two days after I was suppose to leave. So, I had to pay for a hotel room and stay in Berlin for an additional two days that I didnât plan too. When flying back my flight from Frankfurt to Washington was delayed due to staff shortages. Once I finally get home I later find out that I can not be compensated or reimbursed for my hotel or food for the extra two days that I had to stay in Berlin.

I originally booked in mid June to fly with Lufthansa to fly from LHR to LJU via FRA on Friday 8th July in Business Class. On 6th July they cancelled my flight from FRA to LJU. After many hours struggling with Lufthansa customer service and their useless chat-bot I finally managed to rearrange my flights for Saturday, arriving in Ljubljana at lunchtime. This meant I would miss part of the Congress itinerary, but the formal start wasn't until Monday. Then when I went to check in online on Friday my whole outward trip to LJU vanished! More hours on hold for LH customer services, including one memorable 2.5hr hold. Finally the managed to find flights for me on Saturday evening to Frankfurt arriving at 11pm and then onto Ljubljana at 9.00am the next day getting me at lunchtime. This meant that I would now miss two days. I got the flight at LHR, checking in two piece of hold baggage. I arrived at FRA and went to the hotel desk only to be told that the hotel I had been allocated was on the other side of Frankfurt. When I finally got there it turned out LH had sent lots of people there and the poor hotel staff were having difficulty checking so many people in near midnight. By the time I checked in it was midnight and the bar and the only food facility had closed. The next morning I returned to FRA to continue my flight. When I got on board I asked the flight attendant if she could check that my luggage had been loaded as there had been such a long delay between flights. She told me that the Load Master assured her it was. When I finally arrived in Ljubljana there was no sign of my luggage. I filled in the Property Irregularity Report and left for my hotel in Ljubljana. This was the Sunday and my luggage arrived on Wednesday evening at 11pm!

Price was outrageous, around 6,700 EURO / person, so 21,000 EUR altogether. Service for that price was completely inadequate. Seating: I'm tall but not super tall (6 ft 5''). Did not fit while sleeping into the narrow seat on the A330-300 Business Class, thus couldn't sleep at all. Used to fly a lot between NYC and FRA on the 747-800 (Business Class). That is a completely different size of seat, so it feels like they are trying to fit more seats into Business Class by shrinking the comfort.  Not enough Meals: We were 3 persons on that flight, each person getting their menu at the beginning of the flight. Turns out, they couldn't serve us what we wanted as they did not have enough meals on board. Compare that against the ticket price of 6,700 EURO per person. Also cabin service overall was mediocre ... this is a 9 h 30 min flight and there was close to zero service between meals. You had to actively get up and ask for anything you wanted. Can understand if you try to minimize disturbing sleep of the passengers, but no service is not the answer to that. Lastly, I have gold status (Senator) at LH and was asking at check in if they could connect that flight with my miles account which they said they did ('Are you sure?' Yes!). Turns out, this is not the case. Other than that, check in was nice and helpful. So overall after that experience in combination with that premium price, I would say LH are on the way to serve the market with premium marketing and price, but mediocre performance.

After several calls one operator was able to re-book another flight, two days later the re-booked flight for an extra cost of 654.34 EUR. While all the previous operators were unprepared and useless giving me more expansive options or wrong information about US visas and flights. I am writing all this from LA, an unwanted stop over, where my luggage got lost and while my partner is already back in New Zealand, flying alone, since her ticket (same as mine) was processed regularly.

The second leg from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv was rather odd. We had a connection of 2.5 hours. When we landed in Frankfurt on time the screens showed us the flight was already boarding, which we found to be very weird. We sprinted to the gate, through connection security and passport control, and were devastated to discover that apparently, Israel has special travel regulations that make all flights landing to Israel go through a special process. Our gate was separated from all other gates, it had extra security and when we passed it we saw there is no plane even at the gate. So after security we were essentially locked in a gate that had only one super-over-priced store selling basic literature and food. We waited for 90 minutes until boarding started. When we sat in the plane the pilot announced that our plane ""has the wrong wheels"" and that it would take us 3 hours to replace all the wheels of the aircraft. All passengers were angry. After 40 minutes the captain announced that we will be brought back to the gate, and transferred to a different aircraft. After an hour buses were organized to the new airplane, same model, A321. Once we arrived there were a few dramas involving passengers that were mad that because the configuration was a bit different in the new plane, couldn't seat next to their loved ones. After an intervention of the German police we took off. The crew was excellent, especially A Stadelmann, who although being very tired as we did, did her best and gave an excellent service. At turbulence when I panicked she noticed and calmed me, we had a quick chat and all in all she was very welcoming, using words like ""dear"" to make me feel warm and welcome aboard the plane. The flight was regular, there was no entertainment, and complimentary soft drinks and disgusting sandwiches were given.

We called the booking agent who said our tickets were still all confirmed from their end. Then we called the Lufthansa customer support representative who we had talked with earlier.

2022-09-24,"""no desire to travel again with Lufthansa""",2,"â Trip Verified |  Not a good experience all round with Lufthansa. I thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in Munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of Star Alliance. First, the positives. They automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in Frankfurt. Also our baggage did not get lost. So they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. So, what went wrong? Inconveniently, there was not a single member of Lufthansa staff available at the airport in Munich. Thankfully we had downloaded the Lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. Customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or SMS communication. EU passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. However, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". We took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to Frankfurt departed. Having to spend a night in Munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. The food that Lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. Crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into Munich. All the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. Lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. The designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. There were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. Perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of Lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. The next morning we boarded our new flight to Frankfurt at 6am. On arrival, I searched out the Lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. Most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of Lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. They did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for Muscat, so that meant spending an extra â¬17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. No further dramas onward to Muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. It has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from Lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law.

We flew it coming here because my husband is European and he believed Lufthansa was a good airline. We first took it from SFO and the first problem was they made us pay for luggage even though I showed the agent that our ticket included 1 checked luggage. I always pay for luggage beforehand because itâs a lot cheaper than what they make you pay at the airport. He made us pay $75 anyways. This rubbed me the wrong way but I went on with the vacation. Of course my husband wanted to use them going back to SFO so we did. First, they left late so the plane was delayed and we missed our connection. We tried to run and make it but were held up in Germany because the lady was upset that she couldnât find a stamp in my passport even though I kept telling her I have a residency card for Italy so I don't get a stamp. We missed our connection and then had to deal with customer service from hell at Lufthansa. They guy was unbelievably rude. I first asked him if there was another, earlier flight he could put us on so that we wouldnât have to sit at the airport for like 5 hours. He said no. I asked him if there was a customer service centre and I guess that made him mad because from there he became rude.

I was then rebooked for another flight 6 hours later from Munich to Singapore with a 7 hour layover to Seoul. The reason I booked Lufthansa in the first place was to get the direct flight from Europe. But apparently there was not even one seat available on the direct route the day after. I could have stayed at an airport hotel and Lufthansa could have at least guaranteed me a somewhat comfortable sleep as compensation for their delay, but instead I get to spend the night on my way to Singapore and a day at the airport, already tired from the long extra wait, not even to mention missing my meetings in Seoul that I had planned. When I booked my original ticket I had paid extra for window seats, but as the window seats were already fully booked I got an aisle seat and when I asked if I could at least be upgraded for the inconvenience I was told that it would be on my own expense. As I will be almost 24 hours delayed I thought as it states on the Lufthansa website, that I would get the necessary care during the redirecting, but all I got was a 15 euro voucher (which had to be spent all at once) in one of the airport restaurants. Sadly most meals start at 20 euros so it should rather be called a modest meal contribution instead.

She selected seats in a row that was about halfway between the mid and rear toilet areas. (Around row 40) When we arrived at the departure lounge at Munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. The Lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in Business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. The clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. The suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. After some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. When we got on board, I got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that I had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. I hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. When I got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what I thought was mine or my wife's seat. A short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. Some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. The seats my wife and I endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. The seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. There was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. We noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to Singapore. Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. We had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. So, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. We received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. My wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. When we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat. The parents did their best but the crying and continuous getting up and down to silence the baby made sleep impossible for anyone nearby. Cabin staff were noticeably absent in assisting the parents.

While the seating arrangement in 2-2-2 is not the latest standard for business class, I found the seat comfortable enough for 11 hours.

Schedule changes feel very much the norm in today's travel however, I would have hoped the passenger log for my flight would have been correct. Shortly after take off the lead member of the cabin crew took his time to introduce himself to some of the passengers with some polite chat. At this point it became apparent, despite checking in 12 hrs earlier the passenger log had no idea who I was. Asked if I was someone I wasn't, an accusing ""have you changed seats"" was delivered followed by the non reassuring ""oh, no don't worry"" and a clear tone of 'your not at a high enough loyalty member to warrant my time' was delivered in a closing remark. It should be easy for the cabin crew to tell the truth, so when during the second meal service I was informed that the first option was no longer available I was surprised to see the opposite row still able to order and receive, with the polite question asking if option 1 was actually available my original meal choice was found. I can't help thinking Lufthansa have stripped all customer service out of their operation, several attempts to contact the team before the flight were ignored, the only engagement came when they cancelled a section of the journey and asked me to call them, nice touch that their automatic email pretends they have tried to contact me. A small connection flight cancellation was apparently enough to confuse the booking system and the many people in the call centre.  It took six hours of my time reviewing the Lufthansa schedule and and their ticketing availability to find a route that the 'system' would allow. To rub salt into the wound, at HND I was approached by an agent for Lufthansa and asked if I would like to change flights,  for one of the routes I had been denied and that had always shown availability.

This month (October), I finally received a compensation of 250â¬ per person. (3 persons in total) with excuses for a cancelled flight. Since we traveled in Economy class, we bought awesome fresh ground coffee, a sandwich and Poke bowl, together for 20â¬.

I think Lufthansa offers outstanding quality when it comes to meals. Ecology and sustainability in Lufthansa catering are a big  highlight to me compared to other airlines.

The flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was in an old worn out airplane, with very little leg room. My seat was broken and very uncomfortable. The best they could do was to give me some thick blanket to put under. That made it better, but still not comfortable. The food was the worst I even had on a long flight. First meal was vegetarian ravioli and there was no other choice. When I commented that I am not vegetarian, the flight attendant was very rude, stating that she can only give me what she had.

From Frankfurt I had a 1 hour - 40 minute stop over to reach my connecting flight to HK. An hour before the flight was due to depart I received an email advising me that my Geneva tÅ Frankfurt flight was going to be 15 minutes late. 30 minutes later, I received another email advising that the flight would now be an hour delayed. A Lufthansa representative eventually advised the delay due to a âtechnicalâ problem, and that ground staff would at Frankfurt would be on hand to help all passengers with late or missed connecting flights. While waiting for our plane to land in Geneva we were told the replacement plane was smaller than the original intended plane, as such, our hand carry luggage would have to be surrendered upon boarding, This created even more delays. 40 minutes into the flight, the pilot announced that due to bad weather, the flight would be now diverted to Nuremberg. At the Nuremberg tarmac, we were given little information. Hours later we were told we would be bussed to Frankfurt, however we were waiting for a bus to arrive, and also, there were no ground crew to help disembark the luggage. Later, we were told to collect our luggage and wait for the bus. No specific area was designated. Eventually an airport representative came out and advised the bus would be arriving in 10 minutes The bus ride would take approximately 2 and a half hours. During this entire 6-7 hour Geneva to Frankfurt ordeal, passengers were not fed nor given time to use the bathroom. During the bus ride I received emails from Lufthansa advising me they had, without consulting me, rebooked the remainder of my trip home. This rebooking meant an entirely different route, and it would also mean I would arrive back in New Zealand a whole day later than I had intended. At Frankfurt we disembarked at a bus stop. No Lufthansa representative was there to greet or advise us. The bus driver simply drive away with no instructions. A majority of the passengers stood around lost and confused. Using my phone Google maps, I began walking terminal 1 at Frankfurt airport. At the terminal, we discovered it largely deserted. Not surprisingly as it was well after midnight. Most check-in counters were closed. Eventually we found some staff who handed every passenger vouchers for 1 night stay at a hotel and two taxi vouchers and told us we had to sort out our problems in the morning. Weather problems aside, if there were no technical problem with Lufthansa's plane to begin with, we would have landed in Frankfurt on schedule and avoided the airport closure due to âbad weatherâ and I would have made my flight to Hong Kong. Even after the bad weather and plane diversion issue, the lack of support and help from Lufthansa made the bad experience worse. There was no attempt by Lufthansa to help or guide us from Nuremberg to Frankfurt, and there was no help at all once we arrived at Frankfurt.

We waited approximately 45 minutes on the shuttle in front of the plane before being told, with zero explanation, that we were being taken back to the gate we had just left.  We were then told that our gate was moved from z54 to B23, which is quiet the hike in the airport. This is on top of sleep deprivation and zero real food. I began researching Lufthansa customer rights and found that we are supposed to be provided with a meal voucher to be used at participating restaurants within the airport and that it is built into the bar code of the boarding pass. When we went to use it, the lady at the restaurant said it was something they honor and use but when she scanned the code, she said it hadnât been activated by the airline yet. When we came back to the counter to see about having it activated, we were told they couldnât activate it and a manager had to. It is now 408pm local time.

We were now stranded with no one to help us. We were told to go to the customer service desk where we initially checked in for the flight. The rep recommended that we travel to another airport and book a flight out on a different carrier. We did this at great expense to us. We have since asked Lufthansa to reimburse us for the Lufthansa flight that we never took because it was cancelled by Lufthansa. They refused. I never want to fly this airline again.

The most horrendous customer service, full of misleading information, and no result, in over 6 months! Needed to rebook parents' flights due to my father's medical emergency back in June... called a zillion times, phones constantly disconnecting, three times spoke to a different rep who rebooked for me, three times supposedly booking was confirmed, but then the booking code disappeared from the LH website... I'm beyond appalled!!! What a scam this airline has become!! I kept calling 1800 645 3880, the USA phone number. For weeks, even months, the voice message would say that the lines were busy and to call later. I finally got my call answered in November. I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. I tried the second time. The second rep assisted, I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. Five times in a row! This cannot be normal. At one point, I asked the rep whether they were having issues with phones, and she responded yes, but they are being worked on. But I called on other days, too, and it was the same. I got disconnected every time I got a rep on the phone. Is this a tactic by Lufthansa to keep customers away? Basically you can't get anything solved, since you get disconnected every time!! And I repeat, EVERY TIME!!! Over a span of two weeks, I called the US phone number about 10 times, and got disconnected every time, after I explained to the rep what I needed. So I called the German phone number +49 - 69 - 86 799 799, on December 5, 2022. The rep reviewed the files and offered to rebook my parents' tickets. We spend over an hour on the phone (and got a message from AT&T phone company that I just got charged $200 for the long distance call). The rep gives me a new booking code. She took my credit card number and said I would be charged $41.23 for tax, and $150 for rebooking, for either of my parents. I agreed to these terms. The rep gave me the new booking code. I checked on the website, and the code was on the LH booking site. Two days later I checked again, and the code was no longer there. I called +49 - 69 - 86 799 799 again. Asked a different rep why the code disappeared from the LH website. The rep checked, and said it was because those flights were no longer available (nobody let me know that! Imagine my parents going to the airport on the day of, and find no seats on the plane!). She offered to rebook to âavailableâ dates. Took my credit card information, told me that I would be charged $41.27 for either parent, the booking code would stay the same, and now weâre supposedly confirmed. I received an email from Lufthansa with confirmation. However, the email also said to âPlease call back your Lufthansa Service Centerâ. I smelled a problem again!

In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind âunable to provide you with the excellent service you expectâ - this was well below âdoes not meet expectationsâ. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether weâd make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as Iâm writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. Weâre going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are. I can only hope they uphold THEIR side of the agreement and get us to our destination.

No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge! To make things worse it was outside in the snow, and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers, as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this, as previously mentioned, the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away, but that was a task for tomorrow.

That was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items, jackets, etc. I informed a flight attendant about this, she apologetically told me ""I know but now it is difficult to fix this"", an attitude I respected although the problem was not fixed. A bit later, another flight attendant tried to ""help"" me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag. Then, I told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit. He just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage, claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg (which is a cheap lie according to the official website of Lufthansa) and everyone has done the same here. That is rudeness at a different level, I've never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically (1st time flying with Lufthansa though, maybe that's the problem here). He also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat, that sounded so ridiculous. All in all, instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort (without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight), the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft! I have NEVER seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights I've been present. To the contrary, all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting.

I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: âYou can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receiptâ. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information. Six weeks later, I received another email requesting my ticket information and address. I sent the information back again with the message about a third time After two more months I received a final email: âThank you for your feedback We sincerely apologize for the unintentional delay in responding to you.

2023-05-11,"""horrible April Fools trick""",1,"â Trip Verified |  
My family and I were so excited to visit Venice for the first time, and booked an April 1 departure flight from Hong Kong though Frankfurt with Lufthansa.  Firstly, they canceled my outbound flight just a few days before without automatically rebooking me on an equivalent flight (incredibly, they just removed the segment from my itinerary), with just a discrete email sent to me. I felt myself lucky that I checked my email a day before going to the airport and realized what had happened. As their on-line rebooking system was completely useless (ie. they had simply removed the cancel flight segment without a trace from my itinerary, and so the on-line system could not even find it to rebook.). After 30 minutes of frustration with their useless chatbot, I called into their customer service line, and then the next 90 minutes of pain really started. I tried both their local HK and German hot lines, with a reasonable wait each time, but each time a few minutes into the call, the line would simply cut off. This happened whenever they put me on hold, and sometimes at other random times also. After trying both mobile and land lines at my end, I realized this was probably Lufthansa's IT system issue which the agents seem obvious to. In the next calls, I had to beg the agent to call me back if the line dropped so that they could complete the rebooking transaction. None did for about 10 tries! The Asia-line call center was particularly horrible, as the agent was incredibly rude and evasive, trying to argue immediately that Lufthansa had no responsibility to handle the case as the original ticket as booked through an on-line agent (I booked through Booking.com, whom I had already call. They indicated the Airline was the only one who could make the booking change). Incredibly the agent spent about 3 minutes tried to find every opportunity to evade instead of just solving the problem, and eventually the line dropped (or perhaps he just hung up on me!). Incredible that Lufthansa hires people like this for customer service.  That night, after nearly 90 minutes of trying, I finally got someone on the German call center who was kind enough to call be back after the system dropped the call. She said she rebooked me on a KLM flight that departed half a day earlier and despite the horrible experience, I thought I was saved! Next day, a Friday, my family (4 of us) rushed to the airport to catch the new flight. We had to pull both of our kids out of school a few hours early, and I left work early as the new flight departed mid-day Friday, instead of the original we booked which was early AM Saturday, just after midnight. We didn't realized the horrible April Fools trick Lufthansa has played on us until we reached the KLM check in counter. With 2 hours before flight departure, the counter agent informed us that Lufthansa has incorrectly rebooked the flight with wrong ticket numbers and we could not get on the flight.",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,2205,A340,Family Leisure,Hong Kong to Venice via Frankfurt,April 2023,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2023-05-11,"""I expected much better treatment""",1,"â Trip Verified |  
I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline's customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem, we received no information about the status of our bags, and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully, a service agent who overheard our conversation, and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore, Lufthansa's reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100% of the toiletry items and 50% of the clothing, we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th, we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts, which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise, two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead, we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions. Although the flight attendants offered to compensate us for the damaged seat, they changed their minds three times,  For the high price of a business class ticket, I expected much better treatment and a more comfortable experience.

2023-05-26,"""they have practised cost cutting""",2,"â Trip Verified |  Lufthansa used to be a very good airline but in recent years they have practised cost cutting to a level that impacted customer experience, food and service quality and is simply not acceptable anymore for a flag carrier. I had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so Lufthansa flights. There seem to be barely any LH flights that leave and arrive on time. In the last week, I took five LH flights and every single one of them was delayed. At this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. So, we finally took off 40 mins late. I specifically booked a seat in the first row because I have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that LH changed my seat and I was bumped back a few rows. As there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more âimportantâ than I which is not a good feeling. (I would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) So much about recognising loyalty which doesnât seem to have a significant role in Lufthansaâs playbook anymore. Food portions were so small that I thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. Over the last years the food at LH got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. The food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). Being German myself, I do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but I just donât see why people of cultural backgrounds other the German would eat this. I suppose the food in Business was not worth more than about 3 Euros. There is no free food or drink service in Economy at all, The only thing Lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). So, hereâs the âverdictâ: With Lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. There is no free food or drink service in Exonomy Class Loyalty recognition is non-existent. Food is terrible and comes in âappetiserâ portions only. I canât see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)",Business Class,1,1,1,,1,no,2220,A321-200,Business,Munich to Catania,May 2023,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
