2011-01-01,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Copenhagen - Moscow - Havana. First flight an A319 seats quite comfortable with good legroom and delicious dinner. Moscow-Havana new A330-200 seats good although they don't recline were much. The biggest drawback was that IFE offered a very limited amount of movies and TV shows no where near main competitors.,Economy Class,1,yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-05,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,London-Moscow-Bangkok price way cheaper than competitors when we booked planes seemed pretty new decent choice of films music games etc so-so - food. Staff extremely unfriendly no alcohol in economy 3 hours in Moscow. Would always have to be way cheaper than better alternatives such as Thai Etihad Emirates for me to use them again. However much better than Royal Jordanian who we used to BKK last Christmas - they were truly appalling.,Economy Class,1,no,2,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-09,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,4,Bangkok-Moscow-Prague and return. I tried Aeroflot again and my decision was made on the basis of the facts that they use new A330 on their longhaul which is a big step forward compared to their Il96 Russian aircraft and Aerflot flights and Skyteam partners moved to the newly opened Terminal E and D in Sheremetyovo which is supposed to shelter the passengers from the horrors of what is now called Terminal F. The flight from BKK was okay check in was problem free the boarding process was chaotic as usual and staff completely uninterested to help. To my horror we parked at the older terminal and it was the same story all over again. Horrible terminal with sad staff barking at passengers overcrowded old terminal with people sitting on the ground. I consider it as false advertising and clearly the airline lied as my reservations stated all flights were to fly to/from the new terminal. The A330 new and still clean onboard entertainment limited but okay a small number of films and a very limited music choice. The food was good and portions sufficient only one drink then totally zero cabin presence. After the meal the crew hid for at least 8 hours at the back of the plane and ignored many calls for service. They shamelessly kept hauling business class food for what it seems as their own private party at the back galley. Toilets filthy as no one checks on them. The same thing at the return flight. Beware that Aeroflot Bangkok flights are predominantly family oriented so there will be a large % of infants on board which can get very tricky with a plethora of babies yelling all through the red eye flight in unison. Aeroflot's greatest weakness is in its crew - sad robotic and no eye contact whatsoever. Thanks for the flight but I guess Ill give someone else my business until I see a considerable move forward from Aeroflot.,Economy Class,1,no,3,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-09,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,10,Athens to Moscow Sheremyetevo return. New A320 polite staff good food. Price was cheap. I would fly again with Aeroflot.,Economy Class,1,yes,4,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-11,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Amsterdam to Bangkok via Moscow Sheremetyevo. Amsterdam to Moscow can be compared to a flight with any European airline you get even a warm meal. Moscow to Bangkok was excellent service was good even though the crew did not speak good English. Announcements in English were very difficult to understand. You get a warm meal twice and in between drinks and snacks. The selection of drinks is awfully poor for a long haul flight. Aeroflot does not serve any alcohol on flights to Bangkok but they also have not replaced those alcohol drinks with anything else. You are served only Cola Fanta Sprite water tomato juice apple juice or orange juice tea and coffee. Inflight entertainment was excellent with many films and games as well as music. The only negative thing we could find was the fact that Russian passengers do not take safety matters very seriously. We heard mobile phones ringing and passengers going to use the toilet during approach! Apart from the routine announcements and checking seat belts the crew was not interested in telling passengers to behave.,Economy Class,1,yes,5,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-14,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,,I expected to fly from Moscow to Stockholm on December 26 2010 but the flight was first delayed several times and then cancelled. As a result I reached Stockholm on December 28 - after waiting in Sheremetyevo for more than 2 days and nights without any information food or lodging. The electronic screens displayed misleading information about many flights that were delayed or cancelled. I found out that my flight was about to depart merely by chance from my fellow travellers. After registration it was impossible to find any representative of Aeroflot in the international terminal D - they were just afraid to get out to the angry crowd and when they finally ventured they could not answer any questions and would not give their supervisors names. The new beautiful terminal is a mess without those who are responsible for customer service. I felt trapped and betrayed.,Economy Class,1,no,6,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-19,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,"Oslo - Moscow - St Petersburg return. Fine crew meals and planes. Boarding in A319 in Oslo took some 40 minutes most of which were spent inside the aircraft waiting for other passengers to take their seats - thanks to lack of management and guidance from the cabin crew. Due to this arrived to Sheremetyevo D with a 35 minutes delay cutting my connection time down to 40 minutes. Passport control /customs very fast. Waited for luggage about 15 minutes. Ran to the transfer desk where two of the three staff said they can offer re-booking for a later flight to LED. However the third representative was extremely helpful did few phone calls to warn the gate that I am coming and basically ran with me through the corridors carrying my luggage to the LED flight gate. Unfortunately the flight to LED was delayed people were standing at the gate for 40 minutes hearing no info but only ""5 more minutes!"". Finally the gate personal announced cancellation of the flight and we were rescheduled for the flight departing in 2 hours. On the way back from St Petersburg everything went smoothly I even did not need to pick up my luggage at Sheremetyevo for customs clearance. Service and flights were just great. Aeroflot does change for the better but has to put more effort into ground staff training and customer service. English training for the crew is necessary as well. As for lack of smiles - I guess this is simply a cultural feature - Russians generally reserve smiles for situations of fun and/or pleasure and apparently Aeroflot staff do not feel much of either at work.",Economy Class,1,yes,7,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-21,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,It seems the common thread with most fliers on Aeroflot is that planes and flight service is good but the Airport in Moscow is no where near international standards. I agree! I flew one way from Yerevan Armenia to Moscow and on to Los Angeles. New Airbus planes good leg room and above average meals. The flight crew seemed like they would rather be elsewhere and were not very interested to assist when someone had taken my seat. I had to stand for a while and then took matters into my own hands and found another seat.,Economy Class,1,yes,8,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-22,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,JFK-Moscow-Kiev. Food and drink were free unlike many American carriers and found the food to be quite good. I did experience a horrible lack of organization and enforcement of the rules. No one would take their seat and flight attendants would not intervene to get things moving faster. Thus my flight from JFK was 20 minutes late taking off. Other than that the service was professional. Dinner was served quickly along with several rounds of drinks none of which were alcoholic. During landing I experienced the same disorganization and lack of enforcement of rules. When were on final approach to Moscow a woman entered the bathroom and would not leave. There was some attempt at removing her but not nearly enough. The flight to Kiev was more of the same passengers refused to take their seats until the plane was actually moving. There as little to no attempt by the crew to seat them. Our flight was delayed over a half hour because of this. Inflight service was good perhaps better than the flight between JFK to Moscow. Despite the short flight a meal was served and drinks came frequently. Overall my complaint was the lack of effort to get the passengers seated. The flight attendants knew enough English to make ordering food and drinks easy despite me not knowing a word of Russian.,Economy Class,1,yes,9,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-01-23,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,,My first experience with Aeroflot has been really awful. December 26th Moscow Sheremetyevo to Beijing but due to the bad weather many flights including mine are cancelled. Aeroflot is unable to cope with the passengers requests for clarification and the assistant who manages the Transit office is only able to say that she cannot tell anything to anybody and that passengers should just hear the announcements and watch the displays. Needless to say the announcements are barely audible and spoken in a language which hardly resembles English and the displays report incorrect information. We happen to discover by chance that Aeroflot dispenses meal vouchers which passengers are able to receive only after long and exhausting queues. The worst part is when the flight Moscow-Beijing is actually announced at 1630 on December 27th. No information is given as to who is allowed to access the airplane and this causes chaos at the gate. After some time rumors spread that only passengers with a ticket for Dec 27th flight will be admitted as well as some people with the ticket for the Dec 26th flight. After a couple of hours in wait at the gate an announcement of an Air China flight to Beijing has the result to disperse part of the crowd mostly Chinese but when we go to the gate joining the others we notice that the monitor at the gate reports a flight to Antalya. Therefore we go back to the Moscow-Beijing gate and after pushing and shoving we are admitted into the airplane with no apparent logic while other passengers are left behind. What has happened is really beyond comprehension and I discourage anyone from flying Aeroflot which is the worst company that I have used in my entire life.,Economy Class,1,no,10,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-02-02,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,Moscow to Seoul with Aeroflot. I had trouble at Moscow Sheremetyevo airport at check-in on 27th January my seat booking could not be found even though I had rung the day before and was assured I had a confirmed seat. I was sent to Domestic terminal D to a Korean Air office that did not exist - I rang the airline and again was told my seat was booked and confirmed and after going to the service desk at Terminal D being yelled at by a charming girl I did receive help and a man from Aeroflot escorted me back to Terminal F. I had 4 attendants then check me in and one was waiting at the gate to see that I was OK and to tell me to checkin again at Seoul for my flight to Sydney. The flight was fine food was good and the service was fine. Russian airports are very difficult at the best of times I only speak a little Russian but I have travelled with Russians and it is also difficult when there are problems for them as customer service is terrible one. Russia is not a country where it is easy to travel - at airports there is often no trolleys no one who speaks English and rude service.,Business Class,1,yes,11,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-02-06,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,Kiev-Moscow-JFK. Experienced more of the same disorganization that I saw on my previous flights. I have found that flight attendants to not enforce the rules because they are half the size of their very pushy customers. Flight smooth except for passengers attempting to remove heavy bags and dragging every other object out of the overhead with it. Upon landing in JFK we were delayed getting to our gate. While we were stopped passengers got up and got their bags and raced for the exit. There was no effort made to stop them because of the size difference with the FA's. Plane was new and seats were reasonably comfortable. I feel sorry for Aeroflot staff having to deal with stubborn and highly combative passengers. Aeroflot tickets are cheap enough to entice me to fly with them again even if the passengers act like a mob.,Economy Class,1,no,12,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-02-11,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,,Beijing- Moscow. The customer service is appalling! Unfriendly unhelpful and rude staff! Tried to call service helpdesk in Moscow and no one would answer the phone or speak sufficient English. They have a long way to go to improve customer experience.,Economy Class,1,no,13,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-02-14,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,2,Moscow to Vladivostok. The worst flight I ever had  chose economy as biz class is a rip off for domestic flight - service is terrible. I called many time the hostess for a glass of water during the night - no one came. No need to talk about food it was terrible. Service is like the food. My last experience with this airline (beside the one hour flight to St Petersburg I do regularly) I don't understand how they can be SkyTeam member.,Economy Class,1,no,14,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-02-15,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,2,At Beijing we had about 2 hours of delay boarding an aged B767. After another 45 minutes captain said sorry today we do not fly: the plane is broken. By about 0430 in the morning the Aeroflot airport staff said to me that I must spend my night with an unknown other traveller. After having been sent to the miserable hotel at about 1330 next day I was able to leave Beijing to Moscow with a better A332 aircraft. Staff is incompetent and very rude. They just don't know a word of English and if you have a problem it remain a your problem. They have to learn a lot.,Economy Class,1,no,15,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-02-28,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,BKK to Madrid via Moscow. Except for a bottleneck at Moscow airport the return flights were okay - good food limited inflight entertainment reasonably pleasant cabin staff. I would fly with them again if they continue to offer their low prices. The bottleneck at Moscow - transit passengers had to go through one security machine - completely inadequate for the number of passengers.,Economy Class,1,yes,16,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-03-04,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,KBP-SVO and consider it the best option between Kiev and Moscow. I was promised 500 miles for online check in which didn't work. Airport check in a breeze. Boarding was chaotic A321 spotless with good seat pitch. Fast baggage delivery. Onboard experience was somewhat spoilt with inedible breakfast snack and young crew members who looked lost and helpless. English announcements were hard to comprehend.,Economy Class,1,yes,17,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-03-06,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,4,Bangkok to Budapest through Moscow. The plane leg room and food were ok nothing too great but adequate. Entertainment is rather limited especially when you are offered the same films on the way back. Passengers were sober and quiet but they did not react security calls and moved around cabins in a random manner. A huge queue to go through a single transit desk in Moscow. One machine - a real embarrassment. Airport is a 19th Century with coffee costing £5. We needed some help with finding a gate. I approached 6 airport staff - all were abrupt rude and unhelpful (I am bi-lingual and tried both languages). Staff in the plane were polite but still no smiles as in other airlines. There were numerous delays in all locations. I have to say that the price was very good so will go again. Please smile more and show more films.,Economy Class,1,yes,18,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-03-10,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,BKK-SVO-CDG. Long lines slow and chaotic check-in at BKK. Planes spotless and economy seats reasonably comfortable. Crew did not stop passengers from standing up and opening the overhead compartment while taxiing. Onboard service was minimal. BKK-SVO crew performed their duty but without smiles. SU does not serve alcohol on economy class for the BKK-SVO route. Onboard food has nothing special to mention about. Limited drinks and entertainment choices. SVO transit security checks extremely slow since there was only one counter. SVO has been renovated since I last passed through this airport. I did not expect much and the ticket was the cheapest!,Economy Class,1,yes,19,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-03-23,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Brussels-Moscow-Beijing and back. Arrived in Moscow 15 minutes late but departure to Beijing was one hour late. Reason (de-icing of the aircraft) was announced. A320 on the Brussels- Moscow stretch older B767 on the Moscow-Beijing stretch. Service onboard was correct and friendly and meals of decent quality. I feel that good quality was offered given the very low fare.,Economy Class,1,yes,20,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-03-24,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Amsterdam-Moscow-Beijing and back. Friendly staff good meals and good seats. Only in the flights from Amsterdam to Moscow and back is no inflight entertainment. IFE Moscow - Beijing good and a lot of choices of music movies. We had friendly staff even smiles sometime. Meals good different and good quality. A few little delays but nothing more then a few minutes. One problem is that we fly on the old terminal F the people are rude and unhelpful but the new terminals are better.,Economy Class,1,yes,21,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-04-03,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Geneva to HK via Moscow. Aeroflot was good for the given price. The customer service was up to the mark (eg. I didnt confirm veg meal while booking but attendant once informed remembered to bring me veg meal with a smile). I found it to be a cultural thing with the russians which you should be open enough to accept it. Things can be little chaotic at Moscow airport. Check which airplanes they are flying on given routes and make booking accordingly - Airbus they had were new.,Economy Class,1,yes,22,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-04-10,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,,The service at SVO airport is horrible. I flew to Copenhagen by SAS flight 8700 operated by Aeroflot. The agent wanted to charge me for the excess baggage. I tried to explain to her that on a code sharing flights I am governed by the rules of SAS not by Aeroflot rules. But she did not want to listen repeating again and again that she knew the rules. Eventually after a long verbal exchange she called the authorities and found out that I was right. In the Aeroflot lounge - which I was entitled to use in lieu of SAS lounge - the employee on duty refused to let me in. She sent me to the other end of the airport where the people sent me to another lounge and each refused to let me in. The employees of the Aeroflot as it turned out did not know their own airport: they did not know any telephones to call nor they had any directories at and they did not know even the telephone of their own lounges in different part of the airport nor were they able to provide any reasonable assistance. Eventually at my insistence one of the supervisors after calling around for 10-15 minutes found out that I was indeed eligible to get into the very first lounge. The same girl who did not allow me in eventually had to call and find out that she was wrong. She never apologized. In fact all the personnel there turned out to be so rude and incompetent.,Economy Class,1,no,23,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-05-14,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,2,Hamburg to Tashkent via Moscow and not impressed with Aeroflot. Plane interior was old and not very clean. Entertainment not existing on both flights. Inflight magazine only in Russian. Food was tasteless and choice of drinks is very limited (one drink on 3-4 hour flight and only choice between orange and tomato-juice and Cola or sprite. No alcoholic drinks served or sold. All in all a very disappointing experience!,Economy Class,1,no,24,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-06-03,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,Moscow SVO-Astrakhan ASF-Moscow SVO outward by Aeroflot inward by Nordavia. Access to SVO is tiresome but airport is first class : easy clean and helpful. Both flights on time. Aeroflot a new Airbus Nordavia an old 737. Pilot information good cabin service impeccable light food dull but adequate.,Economy Class,1,yes,25,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-06-05,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,10,I use Aeroflot pretty often on my flights from Los Angeles to Moscow and domestic flights to Russian Far East. Food is great new A330-200 entertainment systems are very good with a big choice of movies. I am loyal to SkyTeam and was forced to used Delta a few times on my journeys to Russian. I realize that Aeroflot staff do not smile always but other things compensate for it. I'd rather not be hungry and bored with okay staff then be hungry and bored onboard of Delta planes.,Economy Class,1,yes,26,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-06-19,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,SVO-HKG (return) in April 2011. I decided to take this trip because Aeroflot recently replaced old fleet on this route with new Airbus A330 and because ticket was quite cheap. The plane is really good food and service are good too. On both legs boarding was efficient and flights arrived on time. The drawback is departing from old terminal F while most Aeroflot flights depart from new terminal D. Check-in and security are much easier in D.,Economy Class,1,yes,27,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-06-26,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,FRA-SVO-OVB. New and spotless A320 plane. Comfortable seats and decent food on both legs. Colleagues had warned me about SVO but found Terminal D in SVO to be first class: very efficient good signage good services. Both planes late by 30 mins but that's about the only negative thing I can say. All in all a good value for money.,Economy Class,1,yes,28,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-07-11,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,1,"New York-Moscow to Delhi return. On our way to Moscow we found the flight attendants to be rude and unhelpful (and of course not smiling). During the 7 hr layover we became concerned about the mere 1 hr layover on our return trip. It sounded good when we booked it but realizing that we would have to run through security and the length of the airport to get to our flight we didn't think it would be possible. We stopped to ask a woman behind a customer service desk and she said ""yes not enough time"" waved her hand at us and we were dismissed. Getting onto the plane to Delhi we realized our seats were not together. We once again tried to get an answer and was ignored. Very unhelpful and rude. For the return flight we had to change flights in the office in Delhi. Come to find out that there was another flight out of Moscow with a 3 hour layover. We switched to that flight. The office workers in Delhi were also cold and rude. As it turns out by the time we landed from Delhi in Moscow and got to the terminal to fly out that 1 hour layover flight had already left. We would have been stranded in Moscow for who know how long because nobody would have acknowledged our existence let alone get us onto a flight. Oh and did I mention I had ordered veg. meals? On the way to Delhi I did receive delicious meals on the return flights no such luck. I had bread.",Economy Class,1,no,29,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-07-18,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,SVO-BKK in Business Class and was quite surprised. Flight attendants are 40+ ladies but cool and friendly food was very good even though it was a low calorie pre-order meal. The plane was without individual IFE but we received portable movie players with a decent selection. Overall on-board experience was great while airport experience was so-so. Business lounge at Sheremetyevo airport was awful with plastic forks almost no food available no A/C. Aeroflot Business Class is a very good value for money.,Business Class,1,yes,30,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-07-27,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Omsk-Moscow-St Petersburg. Small problems with check-in at Omsk and only received one boarding pass. Breakfast was good and the service leisurely for a 3 hrs plus flight. Plane was full and the flight left and landed on time. Was surprised that they had an English language paper on board. This is an improvement on previous internal flights. Moscow-St Petersburg is a short 80 min flight and received a quick and light second breakfast which was just adequate for this flight. Again the flight left and landed on time.,Economy Class,1,yes,31,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-07-28,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,10,I flew Moscow SVO to Helsinki with Aeroflot I'm very happy with the service very helpful staff. Spacious Economy Class and a very good value for more than an hour flight. No delays on time.,Economy Class,1,yes,32,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-07-28,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,10,Moscow-Volgograd round trip on new and clean 737 & Airbus 330 planes. Check-in and inflight service was excellent in spite of our very limited Russian skills. Good inflight meals at no charge. We had switched our overseas flight from Aeroflot to Delta because of poor Aeroflot reviews (should not have done that). The return Moscow-JFK Delta flight was 3 hrs late causing many on the plane to miss connections at JFK while two Aeroflot planes left on time and made their connections. SVO terminal was beautifully clean modern and bilingual with efficient service in stark contrast to the poor arrival image given by JFK.,Economy Class,1,yes,33,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-07-31,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,6,Aeroflot are not a bad airline though I do feel that for the most part it's fleet and it's service offerings are several years behind those of the competition. I flew Barcelona - Moscow and was swayed by the price. The first leg was in a fairly new airbus A319 with comfortable seats and a clean interior. The only thing of note was the general demeanour of the crew who did nothing to make me feel welcome and were almost hostile in their dealing with the passengers. The pre-flight safety demonstration was multi-language and clear and I found most of the crew spoke English with no problem. In flight refreshments offered were a variety of fruit juices only. Alcoholic drinks are not available though after almost pleading I did get a diet coke. The meal was among the worst I have tasted in my many years of flying. The second leg Moscow-Shanghai was a real eye opener. The Aeroflot website shows that this flight is operated using one of its newer A330 aircraft with in seat entertainment but checking the entertainment listings I found that they been updated for 4 months. Not important of course but an indication of the haphazard approach to service. When I actually boarded I found that the flight is actually operated by (and has always been) by one of the airlines older Boeing 767 aircraft. Aeroflot Boeing 767's are much older than the rest of their fleet and come with little in the way of comfort or amenities. None of our seats or others around us would recline more than 2 or 3 cms. Walking up and down it was clear that no seats offered any noticeable ability to recline. They also had no adjustable headrests. All in all it was a very uncomfortable 11 hour flight. Added to the discomfort was the fact that there was no personal entertainment offered. The aircraft used the old system of large screens placed above the seats around every 10 rows. There were movies played - in Russian often with English subtitles however the quality of the screens and the placement made it an unpleasant experience. Once again the refreshments and food were very disappointing. The omelette breakfast was the only edible thing I had all other food was very poor. The staff on this second flight were more attentive than those previously. My return journey was merely a reverse of the outbound - equally as uncomfortable and equally poor food. The only significant difference was that I had coffee poured over me by one of the cabin crew who gave me a towel to dry my now soaking trousers but still failed to apologize or help in any other way and finally they lost my luggage and once located failed to get it to me for almost a week.,Economy Class,1,no,34,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-08-02,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,Hong-Kong-Moscow and Moscow-Shanghai. I have to say out of all international airlines I've flown Aeroflot is the most out of date with their entertainment technology. The seats while old were leather and soft and I slept for the first time on a flight. Hong-Kong to Moscow was 1.5 hrs late due to winter storms. Trip to Shanghai was on time and the plane almost empty so every passenger could occupy an entire row. The food was average and the staff do not smile but that's just the culture. I would fly with them again one of the better airlines in the cheaper price bracket.,Economy Class,1,yes,35,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-08-21,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,Paris CDG to Beijing Capital via Moscow Shemereteyevo. All flights were on time with good service on board.

2011-09-06,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,1,Delhi-Barcelona. I could not check-in online so called up the airlines to find my flight was re-scheduled. My connecting flight had been rescheduled so that my transit took 24 hrs and they wouldn't provide any sort of accommodation. Moscow airport contains narrow corridors with duty free shops food must be paid with Russian money. There was free Internet but only in a few places with low wifi signal. Plane food was bland and mediocre. Average service.,Economy Class,,no,38,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-09-07,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,,Heathrow to Shanghai via Moscow. London-Moscow flight was pleasant on a modern plane with plenty of leg room and as a short haul flight works well. However from landing in Moscow to reaching Shanghai was awful. Transit through Moscow is embarrassing - one desk with rude and unpleasant staff. I advise you to run off your plane if you have a quick connection because I have no doubt that they don't co-ordinate transit passengers and the plane would leave without you no effort made to fast-track those with short connections. One desk one security machine. The plane from Moscow to Shanghai was late and outdated with less legroom than the short haul flight from London no entertainment and food that was awful. Unfriendly cabin crew. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. Yes it is cheap but there is a reason why it is cheap.,Economy Class,,no,39,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-09-10,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,Istanbul-Moscow-Tokyo (Narita) Economy. Was not expecting much when I purchased the cheapest one way ticket I could find. Check-in at Istanbul despite having a 20 mins wait was friendly and easy. Flight to Moscow delayed 30 mins but the cabin interior was clean and brand new if a bit spartan (no inflight entertainment). Still the seats were comfy and the flight attendants courteous. Moscow-Tokyo leg was great. The seats were comfortable flight attendants friendly and everything went smoothly. My only real complaint is that the choices on the inflight entertainment on this leg were slim but at least it was there.,Economy Class,,no,40,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-09-18,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,LHR-Moscow. On arrival asked if possible to have an exit row seat. Was advised of a €45 charge which was then waived which was a nice start. Aircraft then boarded one hour late and one hour taxi/waiting to take off which made it 2 hrs delayed. Cabin crew efficient but poor command of English.

2011-09-25,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Seoul-Moscow-Warsaw return. Great fare (just 845USD roundtrip) great food onboard. Some delays on both legs but that didn't bother me much. Good news is that Moscow airport has been renewed Wi-Fi and clean air (smoking allowed only in special cabins).

2011-09-25,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,10,I just returned from a tradeshow in the Ukraine. Aeroflot offered the best fare and connections from Nice (via Moscow) so I took a chance - begrudgingly. Brand-new airbus aircraft smiling cabin crew leather seats and plenty of legroom. The crew came and greeted me to thank me for flying them - a nice touch. The food was good - even in Economy. Shrimp smoked salmon a lovely cod dish - very unexpected.,Economy Class,,no,44,,,,,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-10-13,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,Moscow DME to Saint Petersburg. Check in was easy. Friendly smiling cabin staff who could communicate at a basic level in English.

2011-10-16,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,BRU-SVO-LED PEK-SVO-BRU. Short haul flights with A320. Lots of legroom new planes. Long haul flight with new A330-300 legroom ok but bad seats who got pretty painful after a while good IFE with pretty good selection of movies. General comments : staff is good but not too enthusiastic. Food average. You have to pay for alcoholic drinks on long haul flights (alcohol banned on some flights).,Economy Class,1,yes,46,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-10-19,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,4,I booked a London to Tokyo flight via Moscow as it was the cheapest fare and the journey time was good. We booked vegetarian meals and confirmed these via the booking agent Opodo. However when checking in it became apparent we had no vegetarian meal. The stewards on the first leg were great and rustled up a vegetarian meal for us they were good and I started to wonder what all the bad reviews were about. However during the next leg it was obvious - the staff never smiled and were not helpful with our vegetarian request. The inflight entertainment was not great a few new movies - it was a laugh to see movies from the 70's though. The return leg was not great we didn't even bother asking about the vegetarian meal as I couldn't face the stern expression on the steward. It was not a pleasant journey. Aeroflot is much cheaper than other airline and I would recommend it as it did the trick we arrived safely. So if you are happy to forego smiling staff have a passion for old Russian films and do not want vegetarian food you will love Aeroflot!,Economy Class,1,yes,47,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-10-22,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,"Peking-Munich in Business. A good experience. New A330/A 319 planes clean and good seats. New lie-flat seat on 330 wasn't really flat but perfectly fine for a daytime flight. The real surprise was the 319 which has ""proper"" business class seats even on this short three-hour flight (i.e. four seats in a row rather than the usual six seats with the middle seat kept free). Good selection of food and drinks. Plenty of IFE (about 50 movies to choose from and on-demand even on the short-haul sector). Most staff didn't speak too much English but perfectly fine to get the job done. The only letdown was Moscow airport. Yes the terminal building has been refurbished to international standards but the many uniformed people barking at you in Russian and the organisational chaos are still a nuisance. No customer service culture there. I chose Aeroflot on price and got very good value for money.",Business Class,1,yes,48,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Travelling with my wife it was convenient to have the seats to ourselves without someone else next to us. A320 Paris-Moscow just okay nothing extraordinary but not bad (3x3 seating LCD screens in the row). Personal IFE with good selection of movies in Russian and English on JFK-SVO. They served a hot meal with alcoholic beverages plus usual assortment of soft drinks even on flight Moscow to Paris. As someone who'd flown Aeroflot over the past 20 years they have changed for the better over the last couple of years - and are by far the cheapest option to fly from NY to Moscow.,Economy Class,1,yes,50,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2011-11-07,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,Return flight London Heathrow to Moscow Sheremetyevo. The outward flight started off good. We left on time and the plane was new and comfortable. The food is of a good standard. However once we landed at Sheremetyevo it was a whole other story. Due to weather we had to wait just yards away from our gate because there was ice on the ground. The plane was very stuffy and I think it took an extra half an hour until we finally stopped at our taxi gate. On the inward flight it was much better. Very quick and comfortable.,Economy Class,1,yes,51,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Sheveremeteyvo Airport Terminals DE and F now interlinked though website states still bus link. B767's are old and on boarding it was noticeable that the interior had not been refurbished. Once airborne the service and food excellent. The seats were comfortable and the overhead TV had some good films. Return flight from Beijing on new Airbus A330-300 very pleasant and comfortable. Good personal seatback entertainment system with very wide screens for economy class. Lots of choice though some movies not up to date. Food good again.

Moscow-Shanghai on Airbus 330-200 good inflight entertainment best row is 24 with more leg space. The seats on the side are more expensive but the ones in the middle are free of charge.

Service onboard was plain and overall very correct. I have low interest in IFE though the little I tried seemed quite correct. We were served dinner and breakfast the former with wine. We arrived on time. The transfer went smoothly and the second leg was as pleasant as the other. The fare was 30-40% cheaper than on other airlines doing the route.

The meals throughout the flights were good with all hot meals. No entertainment (even music) available on A320. No individual monitor available on B767. Seat and cabin interior definitely need refurbishment. Even though seat on B767 was very tired it had deeper reclining and was softer than some of other airlines. The cabin crews were friendly.

The transfer at Sheremetyevo is not the most pleasant - old-fashioned counters rude staff with poor English skills. Onboard everything gets better - seat width and food is not that bad but you better bring music and books with you as entertainment is zero.

On each flight served a ""lunch box"" style snack with a croissant or sandwich and a carton of apple juice in addition to a full bar service. Punctual flights and quick baggage reclaim. I am a member of KLM's Flying Blue frequent flyer programme and the miles for these flights were added quickly within a few days of travel.

A new airbus with comfortable seats helpful and smiling staff full bar service and good food. No flight entertainment. Transfer at SVO was ok. Moscow-Tokyo was not delayed. While food and onboard staff were nice the plane a Boeing 767 was falling apart. Flight entertainment was a Russian dubbed copy of Home Alone in one of the few screens that would pop out here and there. The second leg was a brand new A330 with new seats individual screens more than 50 films to choose from full bar service and great food. Staff were friendly and English speaking.

The seats were of average comfort for economy and the inflight entertainment was great with a choice of films and games. The only drawback to this flight is the lack of alcohol (and the choice of drinks is indeed rather limited). However that was the only issue I found and it wasn't too much of a problem.

On arriving in Moscow we thought we still had time to catch our next flight to London Heathrow only to be told the flight had already left. When we arrived at the desk we were given tickets for the next day and told we would be in a Hotel for the night.

They put me on an alternate flight on the same route that departed several hours later and included a 12 hour stop in Moscow rather than a 3 hour one. I requested a Vegetarian meal and had this verified prior to the initial cancellation of my flight. No one at Aeroflot bothered to transfer this request to the replacement flight and that flight didn't carry any vegetarian meals. I received some meal tokens to spend in the airport however the value of the tokens was pathetic by any measure. The only eatery open was TGI Fridays and the only vegetarian option there was soup which I ordered with a glass of orange juice. These two meagre items not only came to more than the amount I had in tokens but required me to pay several Euros too!

We received no communication no new boarding pass and service is lacking. We're not even allowed to leave our hotel room. No sign of Aeroflot within the last 36 hours! The hotel guard explains that lost passengers arrive here every day and that this is very common. The whole service is horrible but the worst part is that really nobody cares!

At check-in I asked if I could request an aisle seat or one with extra legroom (I'm 6ft 7ins) I was told I had to pay 50 pounds if I wanted it. Of course this made the journey very uncomfortable straight away as on both flights I was sat in between passengers. Both aircraft's were very old especially for the long haul Moscow to Shanghai. Entertainment consisted of a projector and white screen at the front of the cabin - the worst entertainment I've ever endured on a 9 hour flight. Staff seemed slow and unresponsive at times however did serve regular drinks and the food was nice. In future I would rather pay a bit extra with other airlines.

2012-06-07,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,Usually I'm flying Economy for business purposes and Business class for leisure. When flying Economy Aeroflot is very good for short haul flights to EU. When flying Business quality issues arise. Lounges sometimes are packed both in terminals D and F especially in the morning or late in the evening. Secondly onboard quality service is unsustainable: sometimes attendants are nice and helpful sometimes rude and evasive. Aeroflot always forgets about its Business class passengers and priority Boarding especially in terminal F for long haul flights. However the major problem is the home airport of Sheremetyevo. In most cases people are spending an awful long time just to leave the airport area. Queuing in a traffic jam next to the airport for an hour on Saturday night after a 2 week vacation and Business Class experience crosses everything out about the Aeroflot flight. So my recommendation to use Aeroflot would pretty much depend on the route time and class.,Business Class,1,yes,91,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2012-06-13,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,JFK to Moscow. Check-in went smoothly. From JFK-SVO the seats were as comfortable as could be. Flight attendants were friendly the food very good: served drinks dinner tea/coffee drinks breakfast tea/coffee. I felt comfortable asking for additional drinks. Inflight entertainment had a very good selection. Once I arrived in Moscow my bags needed to be collected and checked in again. When I came back to the airport 9 hours later I was surprised to find that check-in was easy with no long lines. Once onboard I was surprised to find the airplane in such good condition. There was no inflight entertainment on a 5.5 hour flight but the crew were friendly. The food was my only real disappointment. I'll definitely be flying Aeroflot in the future.,Economy Class,1,yes,92,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2012-07-03,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,I flew May 3rd NYC-MOSCOW connection MOSCOW-KIEV $1500 2 adult tickets. The flight was great! On time and arrived early in Moscow on a nice Airbus A330. The plane was fairly new. The seats bathrooms and interior of the plane was excellent. The food on the transatlantic flight there and back were both great. Chicken or fish with veggies bread and chocolate. The only complaint I would make is they serve the drinks and wait too long to serve the food. They served the drinks 15 mins before the food was served so by the time I got my food I had no drink. The service was 7 of 10. The flight from Moscow to Kiev was excellent as well. 1hr and 15mins on time. Overall Aeroflot is a good airline I would fly with them again!,Economy Class,1,yes,93,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2012-07-09,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,4,8 July flew SVO-DEL in economy class. Unfortunately A330 was unavailable for this trip (despite being advertised on the website) and instead we boarded a Soviet era IL96's. Flight left at least an hour late many of the seats failed to recline and there was no onboard entertainment system in economy. No apologies were offered for this bait-and-switch move by the airline. A glance at the business class section revealed two rows of slightly oversize seats separated by a curtain across the entire width of the cabin. If I were a business class passenger I would be furious . Other than that the flight was relatively smooth and uneventful. My advice would be to avoid this airline on flights over 3 hours and go with the competition instead.,Economy Class,1,no,94,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Flight boarded on time it was a A321 instead of the scheduled A320 due to high volume booking as elite plus we were lucky to be upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. Welcome drink amenity set and a 2x2 configuration. After take off received a nice hot lunch and a drink but the remaining 2 hours no service quite odd. For business seats for European business good service should be better. DIGI player was good for a 3.5 hr flight.,Business Class,1,yes,95,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Instead we had to spend the whole 6.5 hours at the IGI T3. Supposed to board an A330-200 which was unfortunately unavailable so we boarded a A330-300 with wide and comfortable seats and on-board entertainment facility! An hour after take off came the drinks. Then the main- course followed by a delicious cake and a cup of tea or coffee. All flights were smooth and flight staff courteous. In all my experience was very good.,Economy Class,1,yes,96,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2012-08-16,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,PVG-SVO-AMS. Got the lowest price available by a long way so wasn't expecting too much. The flight from PVG-SVO was at 1.40am - the new planes apparently are on the earlier route so the plane was very spartan with shared TVs which showed one film throughout the whole journey. Staff were so serious that it was quite comical (does it hurt to smile?). SVO-AMS was again on a very basic plane this time with no TVs at all but at least the staff were nicer despite very poor English. Acceptable for a very cheap flight but I wouldn't choose them if there were other airlines at a similar price.,Economy Class,1,no,97,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

The level of English was more than adequate. The hand held entertainment systems between Bangkok and Moscow were rather dated and substandard for a business class cabin. There was no entertainment on the shorter Moscow - Simferopol sector. From Bangkok to Moscow the cabin was almost full but service standards were maintained. Food was good.

2012-09-03,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,2,Odessa to Moscow and Moscow to Mineralnye Vody (code share with Don Avia). The flights were like chalk and cheese. The early flight from Odessa was on time efficient check in and an adequate breakfast. Seats OK and no in flight entertainment. Cabin crew polite and efficient. Second flight was originally delayed by 90 minutes and then by another 5 hours and another 2 hours after that. Meal voucher was given (inadequate for a reasonable meal given airport prices) but no real apology and explanations in English lacking. Soon after takeoff I moved seats and slept so no comments possible about staff - they seemed not to speak much English. My rating of the flights reflects very much the impact of the delay on the Moscow - Mineralnye Vody sector.,Economy Class,1,yes,100,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

2012-09-23,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,1,LHR-SVO-ULN return. I have flown this route 6 times over the last couple of months. This is by far the fastest way to Mongolia from London but am fed up by the last of customer service and inability to transit luggage through SVO. The planes from LHR to SVO are generally new and clean. Onward from Moscow the planes are ancient although the business class seats recline flat. The food is always the same - just about edible in business class. Out of my last 4 journeys my luggage has been lost 3 times. Going to give up with Aeroflot and fly Korean air via Seoul now. Via Moscow might be quick but the total lack of customer service wears very thin after a while.,Business Class,1,no,104,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2012-09-27,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,My flight with Aeroflot was really a pleasant one. I flew with them from Amsterdam to Moscow and then on to St Petersburg. Flights departed before the scheduled departure time (all flights) and they landed before the scheduled arrival time. Flights were on their very comfortable Airbus A319 and A320's. The legroom was sufficient for someone of my height (I am 1.81 meters) and the inflight service the food was excellent. Hot meals and alcohol were standard. Cabin crew could have been a bit more cheerful (they didn't smile at all) however they were okay in their politeness and they did their job fine. All in all great flights and I would definitely use them again.,Economy Class,1,yes,105,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

I was worried about the transfer at the SVO but it went smoothly at both passport control and security. The SVO terminals which I used ie Terminal D (for long flights) and F (inter European flights) were connected and seemed to be walking through miles of duty free shops with little seats. Will try again in economy class as far as business class is concerned I think their product is at the same level of most European big companies such as KLM and SAS and definitely superior to US carriers.,Business Class,1,yes,106,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2012-10-11,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,Boarded Aeroflot in Amsterdam for flight to Moscow. Just prior to departing the gate there was a loud commotion in the rear of the plane - it seems we were traveling with a restrained reluctant prisoner. We checked in for our return flight in St. Petersburg for Amsterdam. We requested that we and our luggage be booked thru to Detroit. the attendant assured us that it was done. Upon arrival in Amsterdam we were informed by KLM that they did not receive confirmation of our flight from Amsterdam to Detroit and our seats had been resold. 10 hours later we were aboard a Delta flight on the way home. The issue was not in translation because our request had been relayed by our Russian Tour director and our luggage was booked thru to Detroit. Never again.,Business Class,1,no,107,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2012-10-11,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,3,AMS-KJA-AMS. Boarding in Amsterdam was the horror - more than half an hour at the business class check in and total mess in the departure area. AMS-SVO was okay. Old B767 clean but worn no entertainment nice food the crew unengaged and strangely non-relaxed. Transfer in SVO had slightly improved since the last time but the same one has to get all the luggage travel with it about 1 km and check in again. The navigation system in the terminal is confusing but manageable. Business lounge in the domestic departure terminal D is small heavily smelling with tobacco and a strange selection of food - basically only rolls and cookies. A bit more food is available from the bar for extra pay. SVO-KJA a new A321; the seats were standard economy class with standard pitch which was a bit painful in the overnight flight food good the crew was slightly more attentive to passenger needs. The return flight was the same with the only comment that business lounge in the Terminal F is way worse than in the Terminal D - not clean even stronger tobacco smell and no food at all but Terminal F is terrible in itself so no big surprise. It is a recommendation for this route but only because this is the only option available.,Business Class,1,yes,108,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Inflight entertainment system very good however mine was broken after 4 hours on flight to Havana. Restarting the system helped but then the handset stopped working as well so the system was useless. Cabin crew polite and helpful. Big minus for the food which was awful. Beverages were good although there was no alcohol on this route. Very difficult to understand the ""Russian"" English during the announcements.

Staff efficient but not overly friendly - which is to be expected. Head FA did ask me how I should be addressed and stuck to that preference. Food was fair and there was certainly plenty (6 courses). Drink selection good. AVOD was average - not the greatest selection but enough to please. Transfer at SVO was very easy. Lounge at SVO was average - ok food drinks and good wifi. SVO-TXL on an A320. Immaculate condition of plane and the staff/inflight meals were excellent for a 2.5 hour flights. FAs handed out portable players for flight which is great. Very impressive short-haul service.

2012-12-05,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,10,HAM-SVO-HAM first time with AFL-Business class. Check In at Hamburg very quick. Shared Lounge with acceptable refreshments. Boarding well organized. The big surprise was the C Class cabin. It is a separated cabin with wall and real C Class seats and seat pitch. After seated the FA offered a glass of champagne or orange juice and handed over the lunch menu (3 choices). After take off the purser came and greeted every passenger personally and handed over the portable IFE Digiplayer. Digiplayer offered limited IFE but more than okay for a 3 hrs flight. Lunch was very tasty. Arrival at Moscow Sheremetyevo newest Terminal D. SVO- HAM also at Terminal D - quick Check-In / AFL own lounge without window but offers better quality and quantity of refreshments than Hamburg lounge. Return flight with same great experience.

2013-01-02,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,2,From CDG to BKK via SVO 26/27 Dec 2012. Firstly the plane from Moscow to Paris arrived late causing us to have a delay our original transfer time between Terminals at Moscow was due to be 1hr 55mins but with this delay it was about 30 minutes now. Eventually boarded and was a nice trip. Arrived Moscow through Passport Control and Security then a long fast walk to Terminal F told to go to gate 46 arrived there no passengers around then told to go to another gate arrived there to find the flight was delayed for technical reasons original boarding was at 20.00hrs but told to come back to the gate at 21.05hrs. At the new time were let through to go onto the Air Bridge instead of an aircraft at the end of the bridge was a metal staircase and buses got on the bus doors wide open minus 20 outside. Eventually doors closed bussed to far end of airport and held in the bus 50metres from the aircraft a wait of 20 minutes and we were let onto the plane after our brisk 50m walk. Passengers boarded then 2.5 hrs after original take off time we eventually got into position. Flight okay food edible. Upon arrival at BKK just after landing and heading towards the Air Bridge passengers rushing to get to the door the plane had not even left the taxiing area.

2013-02-15,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,1,Moscow - Hong Kong A330-300. Both flights delayed (40 minutes and almost 2 hours respectively) which might have been a problem if I had transit. The seats are atrocious and some of them were broken. Mine were broken on both flights (headrest wouldn't stay and the tray table was squeaky and uneven). The service is more or less ok quite a lot of smiles although crew disappeared right after the meal for 8 hours. They answered the calls quickly so not really a problem. The meal was mediocre quality hit or miss catering from Hong Kong significantly better than from Moscow. They ran out of meal options on both flights pretty quickly. IFE screen was malfunctioning on both flights although after they restarted it it worked flawlessly. The system is pretty slow but I liked the movie selection. Aeroflot misinformed us twice on the gate we were arriving to which made it hard to greet us at the right terminal. They also decided that the bus is good enough to deliver the huge crowd of 300+ passengers to the terminal. Overall the experience was poor especially because of the seat pitch problem and broken seats. I must say Aeroflot is quite good on short- haul and medium-haul European flights but I would never take a long-haul with them again - the seats the delays and overall service leaves a lot to be desired and the overall feel is Aeroflot doesn't care about its customers at all.,Economy Class,1,no,121,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Separate check-in for business class disturbed by allowing economy class pax using the biz-class check-in counter. However correct check in though a bit stressful as the airport and particularly the flight to Moscow was crowded. Flight HAN-SVO overbooked and roughly 20 of 34 seats in business were economy pax being upgraded to business. FA managed to accommodate all additional pax. Access to lounges in HAN SVO and VIE went smoothly. Invitation cards issues at check in and at transfer desk in SVO. In SVO you are free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board.

2013-04-03,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,"PRG-SVO-BKK. A smooth flight to SVO on a newish A320. Seats are proper business class seats (2-2 config) but they do look and feel a bit outdated already. Nevertheless still comfortable and there's plenty of space. Cabin crew were polite and effective. The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered. IFE system with proper wide screens offers sufficient amount of entertainment apart from the choice in music. All in all a very positive experience with Aeroflot. Would certainly fly Aeroflot again.",Business Class,1,yes,131,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2013-04-04,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Hamburg-Moscow-Shanghai. HAM-SVO on A320 smooth check-In with 2 boarding passes (HAM-SVO and SVO- PVG). C-lounge with basic refreshment. HAM-SVO C class cabin seat and service were excellent. Arrival at SVO new Terminal D quick and easy transit at both passport/security. SVO-PVG departed from Terminal F very long walkway from D to F. Terminal F awful old/dark/busy. Lounge at Terminal F was difficult to find. I was refused entry because I did not have the invitation card. Had to go to transit desk. After entering I noted the lounge was full no seat available. Flight to Shanghai on time with new and clean A330. Seats 2-2-2 not full flat but comfortable to sleep. Good onboard service greeting by purser/crews with good English skill. Foods (3 choices) very tasty. AVOD with 500 programs. Return: quick check-in with 2 boarding passes good spacious lounge. Flight PVG-SVO at 1.30 am. Old/tired B767 seat 2-2-2 narrow and less comfortable than A330 portable IFE with DVD-player same good onboard service. Landed at Terminal F and lesson learned went to transit desk asking for C-Lounge Access card. SVO-HAM A320 left Terminal D on time with best European C Class cabin I have flown. Good products with following minus points: No priority boarding on all legs no priority handling of baggage chaotic handling at SVO Airport.,Business Class,1,yes,132,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2013-04-14,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,Overall: You get what you pay for. Cheap flight from IAD to IST via SVO. Flight was delayed from DC. No reason given or even boarding announcement. Strange things: inflight safety video on old 767 was set to techno music first in-flight movie on overhead screens was a 1940s black-and-white Soviet film with English subtitles and they serve drinks about 20 minutes before meals so you're thirsty again by the time you eat. Food was bad except for breakfast pancakes which were really good. Bring own food and entertainment.,Economy Class,1,yes,133,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

2013-06-04,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,Sydney to Moscow and return in May 2013. Hong Kong to Moscow and return was in business class with Aeroflot. Very impressed. Seats on flight to Moscow were of an older type of business class seat but did everything I needed and all ancillary services (entertainment etc.) available. Seafood meal was probably the best airline meal I have ever had. (Expectations high but I think reasonable). On return flight had more recent capsule seats. Airbus planes looked new and counter service very good. Had domestic Aeroflot connection in Moscow to St Petersburg.

Recognized Skyteam gold status and granted lounge access in Saigon as well as in SVO. Galaktika lounge in SVO had to inquire lounge card at transfer desk. Could choose any of 5(?) lounges. Flight SGN to SVO on Airbus 330-200. Approx. only 60% load was lucky to get some sleep as I needed it though day flight. News for international Aeroflot: they (again) serve wine (free) at economy-class though of limited quality! Good food 2 hot dishes offered at lunch at my seat (behind) only one choice left namely fish which however always is my first choice. Starter was mayonnaise marinated potatoes with red fish meat. Main dish was rice/catfish (white fish meat). Fantastic films on IFE! Small screens but easy to operate and good selection of films including some Russian movies of high quality. Staff nice and caring especially when speaking loud slow clear and polite English to them as their English is at times limited. Stewardesses were appealing dressed in neat smart orange-coloured summer uniforms! SVO-CPH in smaller Sukhoi jet which is nice similar to Airbus 319. Eventless trip soft drinks snack served (3 hours flight). Everything functioned OK.

2013-07-29,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,CPH-SVO-DXB-NBO. Smooth check in all flights briefly on time and connections smooth. Lounge access given at all concerned airports as being Skyteam Gold (though AF). CPH-SVO on Airbus 321. Flight basically full. Service fine but sparse. Alcoholic drinks for sale only. A cold lunch tray given quality acceptable. Seat good was given a spacious emergency seat. Bus to terminals in SVO. SVO-DXB on Airbus 319. No IFE but who cares. 16 seats left in economy I volunteered to give up seat 7C to the back row next to toilets as it allowed for stretching. Service devoted. Alcohol charged as only free on intercontinental flights. I would assume that SVO-DXB is pretty much intercontinental? Service excellent though by sitting on last row one is left with no food options but the ones left (clalf-meat) was good. English poor-very poor. Staff charming young and in excellent mood. DXB-NBO operated by Kenya Airways. Overbooked on business class 1 person was downgraded. I got one of the very last seats in the middle of an 2-3-2 configuration. But the staff were good hard-working in a sparkling mood and attentive. Ordered 2 drinks and was given 2 of each (as to make up for busy FAs and few rounds of service). This happened to everybody who cared but only at the first service - IFE on large plenum screen worked surprisingly well. Good information from captain and purser. Luggage delivery at the belts in Nairobi stressful and confusing. Monitors were not properly working.,Economy Class,1,yes,143,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

The service was incredible (actually as usual on Aeroflot long haul flights in business class compared to short haul it is better). Our plane was delayed but we arrived only 7 minutes later than it was proposed). Cabin was originally designed for EgyptAir and it was very good. Entertainment system has a big variety of films and all films can be watched in either Russian or English.

Bus stopped about a hundred metres from the steps to the aircraft as the heavens opened. 50 people ran at once to try to escape the deluge. Utter chaos and appalling management by Aeroflot. Cabin crew were singularly unhelpful saying to a passenger who complained ""it's not our decision"". It took a good half hour from when the door was closed to take off which added to the frustration of the delay. But once airborne things took a turn for the better. The Cain crew were personable and efficient. Dinner was served promptly and was tasty. Impressive too was the nutritional information next to each dish - calories protein carbohydrates. The Italian red wine was more drinkable than many I've had elsewhere. IFE was via individual players that were handed out after a polite request. Reasonable selection of films. Spent a further frustrating 30 minutes in the hold before landing 90 minutes late. Luggage took another 20 or so - definitely not treated as priority.

The actual flights were OK. I received my preferred seats on both flights and quite good English spoken by cabin staff. Reasonable meals were served on both flights evening though the Omsk sector started at 1.40 am. Both sectors were fairly well on time although departing Krasnodar was a little late (because of the problems with checking in.

The plane an Airbus 300 as I recall was clean and in good condition. The entertainment system gave free movies (free ear buds handed out) music and TV. The luggage arrived with us. The connection in Moscow was easy. I have only good things to say about my experience with Aeroflot.

Food was great I asked for an extra meal on both flights and they gave it to me. The offered wine for free in economy class. FA also friendly. The only concern is the delays. When I flew there the delay was 40 min on the way back the washroom broke down in the aircraft so the delay was 4 hours.

I have been travelling Aeroflot for many years but I have never had such an uncomfortable seat in my life. Seems like the seats were designed by Gestapo for torturing passengers for 10 hours. Short narrow leaned forward! I will never understand the purpose of the head piece which makes your head protrude forward even more unless you are more than 2 meters tall. I felt very uncomfortable and tired. It was especially bothersome due to slow food service (it took the flight attendants about 2 hours to serve lunch and tidy up).,Economy Class,1,yes,156,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2013-10-02,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,Our flight going over from JFK to Moscow was good as well as the food. However on the way back home from St. Petersburg is where all the problems started. Our original flight was delayed 12 hours which meant missing all our connections. We stood in line for 5 hours. The service at the airport was horrible. No one would help us get a flight. After many hours different lines talking to many representatives we made a call to our Travel Agent and the Emergency help number that we had. Only after these calls were we able to get another reservation home. The flight was fine but the on ground service is far from good or caring.,Economy Class,1,yes,157,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

We were booked on a 6.30 am flight to Moscow and were finally rebooked for a 2.40 pm flight. We were at the airport at 4 am and the plane left at 3 pm - that's 11 hrs in the airport.

2013-10-07,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,Moscow-Hong Kong flight was well below my expectations. Terminal F has been revamped with too many shops and not enough seats. Passengers camped on the stairs and the floor. As there were other flights to China departing from nearby gates almost at the same time one can only imagine the pushing shouting and queue-jumping. Allocating more space to people and less to shops would help address the problem. We boarded on time but some passengers had so many duty-free shopping bags that overhead storage soon reached maximum capacity. Tempers flared departure was delayed. I had to keep my backpack under the seat thus reducing that precious little space. After takeoff we were told that the entertainment system was out of order. No films no music no games. nothing. I had ordered a vegetarian meal at the time of buying the ticket online 6 months earlier and this is usually a very tasty Asian- style hot meal. This time my name didn't appear on the flight attendants' list despite being clearly indicated in the electronic ticket in my possession. Flight attendants ignored the issue and just apologized for the mistake. The best they could offer was a normal tray with two small salads instead of one. A few hours later when they served breakfast I realised that 2 out of 3 standard options were ok for vegetarians. Why wasn't a breakfast tray offered to me at dinner time? Flight attendants started serving tea and coffee. Due to turbulence they had to stop serving hot drinks and at least 100 passengers were left without any hot beverages to accompany their breakfast. The turbulence ended but serving hot beverages was never resumed. All in all not the best experience.,Economy Class,1,yes,159,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2013-10-09,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,Roundtrip from Dulles International Airport to the Czech Republic stopping in Moscow. Dissatisfaction is the word that came to mind repeatedly during these series of flights. The food was excellent. Served on time and hot on each of these flights. Very consistent. The cost was excellent compared to other airlines offering the same trip. It was downhill from there. Of the total 4 flights required to make this trip zero were on time. Every single flight left late. This is clearly a normal practice for this Airline based on my experience. The initial flight to Moscow from Dulles (10 hours or so) had no working video displays for entertainment. There was working music but the headphone connector on the seat was shorted and would barley play sound in mono and only if held in a certain position. After landing and proceeding to the terminal in Moscow there was complete chaos. The airport appeared to be clean and new with lots of English signage however some of the people working in the terminal seemed to be avoiding anything that resembled being helpful. Most seemed to have attitudes for some reason. Russian passengers herded like cattle to the tiniest security checkpoint area that I have ever seen. There were 4 lanes for 300 people. The return flight was worse. After I reached Moscow from the Czech Republic there was more herding to the security checkpoint. This time a customs representative sat at a desk near by reading a book as a few hundred people waited in lines that barley moved. I asked the person reading the book if I was standing in a special line or something since the signs were not in English she responded that I should find another line in a tone that indicated the I was disturbing her. I eventually wasted an hour before I discovered that I was in the area of customs for domestic flights and not international. The International flight area took 3 minutes to process. This theme of herding and poor manners played out at every airport except for the final destination back in the US. I will never fly Aeroflot again. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.,Economy Class,1,no,160,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

The airplanes are good however the transit service is really poor this might be because of the airport it is hard to figure out your flight gate and it is complicated to get information from the staff. Waiting hours are awful I expected to get some sort of cabin or something upon arrival but sleeping on the floor buying your own drinks is about it.

From Moscow there are no direct gates so you have to take a bus to board the plane. Waited 10 minutes inside the bus while it was right under the plane already. Another one and a half hour inside the plane before they drive us back to the airport and gave us 400RUB (gets you a coffee). Overall the flight was late by almost 6 hours on a 4 hours route. From Tel Aviv the flight was late by about half an hour. Upon landing had to board the bus again. It drove for about 20 minutes to the terminal.

Terminal F at SVO is crowded and inconvenient. Cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food was served twice good choice tasty meals. Entertainment system is very good. Blankets and earphones were given to all the passengers. Seat comfort was very poor to me. Seats are narrow with surprisingly little legroom. When you recline your seat the bottom part goes forward it makes the legroom smaller. Not the best experience ever but I would fly them again if the price is fair.,Economy Class,1,yes,171,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-01-16,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,1,We traveled with them over this past summer and had a day delay and then when we finally got to Moscow the connecting flight was difficult to find. They changed the gate at the last minute and didn't make an announcement. We unfortunately missed our flight because of this and they weren't sympathetic at all. Mind you we had a toddler with us and I was 7 months pregnant. It was awful. We had to pay for a new flight and didn't give us many options. I will not be flying with them again.,Economy Class,1,no,172,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-01-20,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,Flew JFK-SVO-BEY-SVO-JFK. The price of ticket was 200$-300$ cheaper than the price of a ticket with other airlines. All flights were ok. If not on time either late by a couple of minutes or early by a couple of minutes. IFE great. Staff OK. One of the things I didn't like is the food. It is edible but it is always beef or chicken with a salad or cheese with ham (on all flights) the meals are not diversified. I didn't like the seats. I'm 190cm so it was really uncomfortable for me to sit in this seat for a flight of 9-10hrs but it shouldn't be the same problem for someone shorter. Airport is good. Staff is friendly. Terminal D and E are new and spacious but terminal F is over crowded and there is a lot of stores and not a lot of places to sit. Overall the experience was good. Will take them again and recommend them to someone if price is good.,Economy Class,1,yes,173,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-01-20,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,1,SU106 SVO-LAX Jan 11 2014 on A330-300. This was some older version airplane I was seated in row 16 in a broken seat and virtually with virtually no legroom. Comfort absolutely inadequate for a 13 hrs flight. After takeoff we were told that we had to land in Oslo to refuel. This turned out to be a 2.5 hrs stopover since no one was informed about our landing and need for fuel. In fact Aeroflot used the opportunity to change the crew so it is very possible that this was the actual cause for the unplanned stopover. All together we spent 16 hrs in that plane and of course missed the connecting flight on DL airlines.,Economy Class,1,no,174,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

We bought two ticket going from BKK to Arlanda round-trip Aeroflot was about 750$ cheaper than the rest. At the airport we got upgraded to premium economy for free. Good food good service and some of the air stewardesses even smiled. Others were not so happy but they where attentive. Of course my upgrade affects my review the only complaint I might have is that the check in was to slow but what do you expect when the plane is full and many get upgraded.,Premium Economy,1,yes,176,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-02-25,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,4,AMS-SVO-KJA-SVO-AMS. Economy Feb 15/23 2014 the only one-stop option on this route. AMS-SVO on Feb 15 was OK A321 clean and relatively new. The biggest problem here was the handling agent in Schiphol apparently Aeroflot took the cheapest option out of available and all the issues such as slow poorly trained staff and poor co- ordination with airport services - everything is delayed all the time and every time (I took over 10 Aeroflot flights from AMS during the last two years). No entertainment system. SVO-KJA on the same day was served by a brand new B777. A decent entertainment system but not much space in the economy cabin. KJA-SVO-AMS was served by A319 and 320 - everything described for the A321 on the AMS-SVO route applies here as well. Business-class check- in in KJA was a very strange procedure but in does not have to do with Aeroflot I guess (although my experience with their KJA agents was thoroughly unpleasant so probably they just do not care to check how those procedure work). Safety training of the crew seems to be a very big issue. They just could not care less. Their usual passengers are not very disciplined in general but the crew just does not act on this at all. Food was good on all the legs although the beverages were a bit below average though - juice and wines were really bad (alcohol only on international legs). Transfer in SVO from Terminal F international to terminal D domestic (and especially back) is still a big problem. Poor information little help from staff. When you are transferring from D to F you really shall look around carefully at each turn (there lots of them) - once you skip a little half-hidden pointer - you are running into a wrong spot and getting through security control (double!) all over again. No SkyPriority service in the Terminal F except business class check-in counters and a VERY poor tiny and shabby business lounge.,Economy Class,1,yes,177,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-02-26,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,HKG-SVO-MAD and return from BCN. Flight crews on all 4 sectors were very professional and made every effort to make the flights as smooth as possible. Food very impressive both in terms of quality and quantity. Seats and Inflight Entertainment were not among the best but still met the average standards you would expect for long-haul flights. The real drawback for Aeroflot is the transfer at SVO in addition to all those comments already made we encountered extra problems as we only had about an hour transfer time on our return journey. A staff member called all passengers to HKG at passport control we were guided through Terminal D and E to the boarding gate at F - all by running there were no trolleys so we had to take all carry on luggage by hand - that's 20 minutes running. Our checked in baggage was left behind only arrived the next day according to Aeroflot's ground agent at HKG this is a daily recurring problem to this flight.,Economy Class,1,yes,178,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-03-10,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,My wife and I flew from PEK-LHR with a tight 50 minute connection at SVO. Having to connect at SVO was the only downside to an otherwise comfortable and pleasant trip. Anyone who knows SVO terminal knows that it is overburdened chaotic and in dire need of an overhaul. We made our connecting flight (no thanks to the indifferent Aeroflot ground personnel) only because the aircraft was late arriving in Moscow. That said we still had to run through the terminal. Flights on SU were surprisingly good with comfortable seating choice of well catered meals and cabin attendants who were very professional and friendly. This airline has really upped their game on long haul international flights. In fact I dare say there are equal to if not better than many of their European competitors. And price wise they are way ahead of the game. It's a shame they use SVO as their hub however.,Business Class,1,yes,179,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

2014-03-17,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,Moscow-Bangkok-Moscow. Departure from old and dark Terminal F in Moscow. Boarding started about 50 people went to the jetty when they stopped everything due to broken galley on board. We were strangled inside the jetway for over 30 mins with no info at all. Couldn't get on board and they closed gate doors so we couldn't comeback to the gate. Horrible service. Flight itself was ok nice 777 but 10 seats abreast is too much on such a long flight - too cramped and not comfortable. Crew were very young tried to smile few times and be nice. IFE was good. Food acceptable but very small portions. No alcohol was served at all. Return flight without any boarding problems. Food much better than from Moscow but no choices were given at all. Young crew didn't smile even once quite poor English female FAs looked very nice and groomed but male FAs looked like some cheap bar workers - all ties untied buttons of shirts were left opened really bad view. Not impressed at all. Generally I wouldn't recommend Aeroflot for longhaul flights as service is quite poor crew inattentive and very cramped cabin but they offer the quickest connection from Western Europe and day flights which saves a lot of time.,Economy Class,1,no,181,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

The return overnight flight had a flat bed and I had sufficient rest to be able to rent a car on arrival in Bangkok the following morning.

2014-05-15,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,6,SVO to MUC and back. Two-hour delay of the flight from Moscow due to military parade and air space closure - no fault of the airline. But the boarding process could and should have been organized in a better way. Wonder why the jetbridge hasn't been used. No such problems on the return flight. Both flights on A320 pretty comfortable seats decent space. Training of the staff should clearly be improved first and foremost the language skills and attitude towards passengers. At the same time a young flight assistant on the return flight at least tried to be friendly and attentive. The food was inedible on the first flight and acceptable on the way back. Entertainment should be enhanced ie. by installation of individual multimedia sets in short and medium-haul aircrafts. All in all the general experience is pretty average. The ticket price was actually quite low compared to other offers for these dates considering the flexibility in the choice of flights and the level of seat comfort is pretty good but the main thing is that Aeroflot should be training the staff harder if they want to improve their international profile. Also basing on my experience of traveling with this airline I can say that the quality of in-flight service can differ dramatically on different flights so it is sometimes really a matter of luck.,Economy Class,1,yes,185,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-05-26,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,LHR-SVO return. Both flights on new and clean A330-300 though seats a bit hard and less comfortable than their A320/321 fleet. Chicken curry on flight to SVO and lamb on return flight and both quite nice. Flight attendants did not smile a lot but were professional. IFE very good with dozens of latest films and music. One thing that could be improved and that's the headphones : they do not give ear cushions and so wearing headphones is very uncomfortable even painful to ears sometimes. The sound quality is also terrible. Quite a pleasant experience on both flights and I will use Aeroflot again. For 250 which is an almost EasyJet price you get a full service package IFE and SkyPriority for a 3 hour flight.,Economy Class,1,yes,186,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

2014-06-01,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,TLV-SVO and SVO-RIX. TLV-SVO was on a new A330. As is typical of the former USSR the boarding announcement was met by a scrum of people rushing the boarding gate. No attempt made by the crew to regulate boarding and as a result it took nearly an hour. Once onboard the flight attendants were generally sour and the food was stale and lukewarm. In-flight entertainment was surprisingly good but still a step down from Delta and similar airlines. Despite TLV-SVO being an overnight flight the cabin lights were never dimmed and the service was staggered in a way that essentially prevented all sleeping. Could not figure this out. SVO was pleasant enough and SVO-RIX was an easy short-hop on a new 737. No service and no complaints. Would take Aeroflot again only if the price was significantly less than other European carriers.,Economy Class,1,yes,189,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-06-04,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,First-time with Aeroflot. Stuttgart/STR to St. Petersburg/LED via Moscow-Sheremetyevo/SVO. Both on-time. From STR to SVO the plane was an A320 and from SVO to LED the plane was A321. The seats were very comfortable and the leg room was impressive! I am 178cm/5'10 and after sat down there was about 15cm/6in in front of my knees. In fact you can put one leg on the other without any problems. I often fly Lufthansa from Germany to Russia and in Lufthansa's A320/321 economy cabin you definitely do not see this much leg space. The food was fine. STR-SVO includes a full lunch and two rounds of drink service and SVO-LED includes a teriyaki chicken sandwich and drinks. The staffs were professional and spoke adequate amount of English. The captains of the flights each made 3 announcements in English (welcome in-flight update and a final goodbye after landing) which were quite impressive. Overall I found the trip very pleasant and Aeroflot's has exceeded my expectations! I can see clearly Aeroflot wants to improve and they are making a good effort!,Economy Class,1,yes,190,1,1,1,N/A,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Both flights perfectly on-time. New aircraft fresh IFE (movies TV shows games - lots to choose from) friendly staff. Legroom could be an inch better but it seems that the rows to the back of the aircraft are worse. Food was unimaginative but edible.

2014-06-09,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,LED-SVO-STR. Very good experience overall. Both flights were on-time and comfortable. The planes were very clean and the cabin crews were very friendly and professional. 1) On LED-SVO I put the sandwich in my bag as I was not hungry at that time. The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty! Overall from my 4 flights with Aeroflot within two weeks I have to say the level of service is quite good and consistent. I think it is really time to change the stereotype that many of us had for the Russian national carrier for many years!,Economy Class,1,yes,192,1,1,1,N/A,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

2014-07-06,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,6,Flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo Narita via SVO and back. First flight from AMS to SVO on codeshare flight with KLM on B738. Flight was OK. Transit on SVO from terminal E to D was a breeze. There were no lines at immigration or security check. As we had a stopover for 6 hours we used the capsule hotel which was accessible from terminal D and E on airside (63 Euros for 4 hours). Flight from SVO to NRT was on an A333. Nice and new aircraft with good seats and complete IFE. We had 4 seats in a row for the two of us as the aircraft was about half full. Crew was attentive and quitte friendy. With one hour delay we arrived at NRT. The flight from NRT back to SVO gave us however some mixed emotions. on an A333 but with a crew that wasn't as friendly as the flight to NRT. We got the feeling we were bothering them even with some basic requests for drinks. Toilets were very dirty on this flight not only the fault of the crew as well as fellow passengers. Transit from terminal D to E on SVO was a mess. At immigration and security check there were long lines with a lot of people cutting lines. Flight from SVO to AMS on an A320 was better than the flight from NRT. Aircraft was however in a bit of a run down state and also quite dirty. Toilet was also in a poor state. The crew however was extremely friendly and flight arrived on time. In the end Aeroflot gave us mixed feelings. If you don't have many expectations for the price you pay for the flight the airline is OK. At SVO you need either luck or a lot of patience concerning transits of flights. If we would fly again with this airline really depends on the price of the flights they offer.,Economy Class,1,yes,196,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-07-06,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,"I flew Aeroflot 4 times over the last 15 days. From HK to Moscow Moscow to UK UK to Moscow Moscow home. The first leg was ""bearable"" if a little short on snacks and food options - so much so that the first thing I did was to buy a little bag of peanuts to go in my carry on. The second leg was uncomfortable due to the shell seats which are nothing sort of a torture device. Two weeks pass before the third leg which was same seats same limited choice of movies and even the same food. The fourth leg - the entertainment system took around an hour to load. Same movies even though it was a different month! But the real issue for me was the meal. With almost every meal they serve 2 pieces of bread. The white ""loaf"" is always icy cold and hard. The little brown slice was also cold and hard. There was not enough butter for both. Given the price I paid for my ticket I didn't expect gourmet food but the piece of salmon was literately the size of a teaspoon. The chicken was barely warm. Usually the food is served piping hot and even if the bread is not heated if you leave your roll on top of your main meal you can get a bit of heat and steam into it. No such luck. The dessert - there was nothing to eat it with in the utensil pack was exactly what it looked like tasteless overly sweet faux cream. Breakfast I chose the pancakes which I was unable to eat they were far too sweet. I was pretty hungry by the time we landed.",Economy Class,1,yes,197,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-07-06,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,6,RIX-SVO-PVG and back. From RIX to SVO it was a partner flight with Air Baltic. Then came the horror of SVO-PVG. I had no option to choose seats. I was asked in RIX while checking in for seat preference and I said aisle. I did get one for RIX-SVO and for SVO-PVG I got a 28th row which on their A330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. The seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. The food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. The bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. The dessert was surprisingly good though I had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. And now for the best part the service. Apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop / bad cop principle as in both aisles we've seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. So imagine my surprise when on the return flight from Shanghai to Moscow I was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff (still not smiling) got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 3-4-3 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. The short flight SVO-RIX was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. To sum it all I'd say its a real hit and miss thing with Aeroflot. Stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 they're great. If you're unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. The food probably depends on where they get it. The entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies TV shows and music. Do not expect a good polite service on every flight. Other than that flights were on time with great connections and very reasonably priced.,Economy Class,1,yes,198,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Seats and leg room are OK. They offer Space + seats located in the emergency exists and prices are reasonable. Cabin crew no friendly enough from my point of view if I compare with other airlines to flight to China like BA Finnair or AF. The main difference is that they provide slippers and eye masks no offered by other airlines. Cabin and toilets are clean enough. Moscow airport is awful and really boring.

Also the flight stats are throughout the whole flight very nicely displayed - including nearest towns at what direction and distance - never saw that with our airlines.

2014-09-22,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,2,Me my wife and our daughter were flying Sweden-Kiev-Bangkok with Aeroflot. I have really nothing positive to say except the low price. Of course we understood that we would not get much because of that low price. However we did not see the crew at all during all the flights only when the food was ready which was at really strange times we and many others on the plane were very hungry. We were served lunch and dinner on the first flight then breakfast on the second. The food was horrible. The food we got for lunch and breakfast was exactly the same and we did not had anything to choose from. The tv-screens at all seats were not working but that was not a big deal for us. We will never fly with Aeroflot again.,Economy Class,1,no,205,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-10-08,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,St Petersburg - Moscow. Ticket purchased at last minute and check in a bit confusing directed to about three different counters but each without a large queue. Flight was comfortable and only a few minutes late arriving in Moscow. No IFE but it was only a little more than a hour long flight. Cabin crew were friendly and responsive and spoke reasonable English. It was like a shuttle flight and perfectly adequate. Leg room was adequate.,Economy Class,1,yes,206,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-10-28,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,5,I traveled with my two daughters 18 and 13 years old respectively from Dulles International Airport to Moscow with Athens as our final destination. Getting there was a bit stressful because the flight connection was too close for comfort and we had to run to make the Athens flight. The crew was rather parochial. They did not speak much English and their manners were not the best. Food was poor but not horrible. Movie choices pretty decent and the actual flights were very smooth. The pilots were quite good judging by the take offs and landings. The price was unbeatable and though this was not stellar service I would choose again if their prices remained low.,Economy Class,1,yes,207,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-10-28,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,I traveled from Tel Aviv to Toronto via Moscow.

2014-10-28,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,The thought of spending a total of 17 hours on Aeroflot and 10 hours in SVO between flights was somewhat frightening.

Flight attendants polite but lacked professionalism as they forgot about handing out wet towels and two or three of them were sleeping in the last row of business class during this very early morning hour departure.

2014-12-22,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,"I flew HKG-SVO-LED and back in the past week. The seats were really comfortable on both legs; however legroom could be improved (I'm 5""8) and it was pretty cramped in the A330-300 however on the A320 the legroom was sufficient. Food was really good compared with other airlines and I was quite satisfied with Aeroflot's service. On the last flight from SVO-HKG that I took today all economy passengers received medium-haul amenity kits from Business class which was surprising as there was only a pair of slippers and eye-shades on the first leg. Overall I really enjoyed the flight and I'll definitely be taking Aeroflot again in the near future!",Economy Class,1,yes,212,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2014-12-22,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,10,I flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo with a stop-over en Moscow SVO. It was a very positive experience. Aeroflot has gone through a large modernization programme in the recent years and it was very evident when I travelled with them. Most of their fleet now consists of modern airliners such as the A320 the A330 and the Boeing 777. I flew on their A320 from CPH to SVO. For a short-haul flight the onboard service was extremely good compared to most European airlines. The food consisted of fresh bread cheese beef and a delicious cake and the cabin crew were serving cold and hot drinks throughout the whole flight. The crew was extremely friendly. Since the plane was only half full many of the passengers were lying down across the seats. The cabin crew immediately offered them blankets and pillows to make them more comfortable. This is the first time I have experienced this on a European flight. The transfer at SVO was smooth and easy. The airport has been renovated and now offers an easy access between the terminals without having to go outside the airport. The passport and security check took less than 10 minutes much to my surprise and I was now standing in Terminal D which had a wide selection of restaurants shops as well as free WiFi. The flight to Tokyo was on an A330. The interior felt fresh and new and the seats were very comfortable although for a tall guy such as myself the legroom left much to be desired but that is not the fault of the airline. The cabin crew on this flight were fluent in English and Japanese. Again very friendly people. There was a passenger in front of me who seemed rather anxious about flying and kept calling the crew throughout the whole flight. They never ignored his calls or talked bad to him. They kept smiling and did what they could to make him feel comfortable. The food was again very tasty and the menu offered both Russian and Japanese dishes and despite the rather cramped space I had a very comfortable flight to Tokyo. I have read many negative reviews about Aeroflot and I will not deny that people might have had some bad experiences but my opinion on Aeroflot is that it is a modern airline that offers some of the cheapest tickets in the world while maintaining a high standard in customer service. I have already booked my next flight with Aeroflot and I will continue to fly with them whenever possible.,Economy Class,1,yes,213,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2015-01-11,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,I took a flight from Netherlands to New Delhi via Moscow airport dated 16th December. I read all the reviews and statistics to check the possibility of any flight cancellation. Most of the reviews were negative but the stats were sound showing there were not significant delays. I was primarily hoping for 2 things 1). On time flight 2). Safe arrival of luggage. The flight from Amsterdam airport to Moscow (2 hours time) didn't had inflight entertainment. The other flight from Moscow to New Delhi (6 hours 20 minutes duration) had good inflight entertainment system. The quality of food was OK was not at its best. There were no delays in the connecting flights. I had to board from Terminal E to Terminal F which was nearby some 700 meters walking distance. However there were some issues with Moscow Airport - i). To my wonder the security staff was missing and the passengers had to wait for odd 20 minutes. They came scanned the handbags and put stamp on 'boarding pass' ii). the mini trolleys which are otherwise freely available on Amsterdam airport were simply unavailable. The passengers carrying hand bags had to face difficulty in rushing between terminals iii). The sign boards in Moscow airport are not mountedpositioned at appropriate locations. The travelers sometimes have to take U turn to go the correct direction.,Economy Class,1,yes,214,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Very smart looking attractive cabin crew. Good English so all announcements were understandable ( quite rare with Aeroflot). Cons: service downgraded rapidly since last month's flight I took with them. This time only small sandwich and water/coffee/tea offered - nothing else (last time was tray with meal cake and whole selection of soft drinks). EU restrictions I suppose. Cabin crew very official and robotic absolutely no personal touch no interaction - beautifully groomed but cold and serious. Inflight magazine thick and full of good articles but in Russian only (literally last 4 pages were in English only) which is pity as it looks very interesting.,Economy Class,1,yes,217,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

Friendly staff flights on time online check in and seat reservation a breeze at Bangkok you can check in at self service terminal - saves a lot of queuing. Very convenient print boarding card fast bag drop new planes and great prices the food served was not big portion sizes but was tasty standard economy airline food no alcohol served on the BKK to Moscow leg but plenty of soft drinks - water juices etc which came round every hr or so. Moscow airport: I read loads of negative reviews terminal F is old and not great but D & E where most international flights depart from are modern Burger king TGI Fridays etc loads of retail outlets prices same as all airports. I also read its a nightmare to transit between terminals when in fact its not it is a long walk between them but no problem. One security check one passport check. I have to say some staff look very stern but they are actually very friendly. There is no smoking in all terminals. All in all I would fly with them again based on price and service I received.,Economy Class,1,yes,220,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

On my trip to Tokyo the flight attendants noticed that I was struggling to get room for my knees and offered me one of their personal seats which had more legroom and since these seats did not have any entertainment system the crew made sure I was comfortable for giving me extra drinks.

I guess the only complaint is the food which was horrible. Cabin crew helpful and efficient. No alcohol policy on airline due to incidents with drunk passengers. But overall Aeroflot did a good job getting us from a to b via SVO. We would book again with Aeroflot. But a food upgrade would be nice.,Economy Class,1,yes,223,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

2015-03-04,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,6,SVO-PEK and back. I have travelled with Aeroflot several times within the past year I have to say that the level of service you get with this airline is inconsistent. Compared to my last trip with them (STR-SVO-LED and back) which was extremely satisfying this time the service is only so-so. For SVO-PEK the cabin crew seemed inexperienced. The crew disappeared immediately after dinner service. The food from SVO is very average and the cleanliness of the toilet was not maintained well during the flight. For the return trip the crew members seemed much more experienced and they delivered a fairly high level of service. The food was also significantly better. Overall I think Aeroflot is improving. However they still have a long way to go. As a passenger your experience with them can vary greatly depending on the crew or the route. But considering the price which was very competitive I must say that what I got for this trip was fair.,Economy Class,1,yes,225,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2015-03-09,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,2,Flew Shanghai to Paris via Moscow. What a nightmare: aircraft ancient (still had ashtrays in the arm rests) torn and dirty seat covers toilet unspeakable by mid-way through the flight and the stop-over in Moscow is always stressful. Why do they make everyone disembark with all their hand luggage check the luggage through security when it hasn't been anywhere but on the aircraft since the previous security check and then make everyone get right back on the very same plane? If you are seated at the back of the aircraft then you spend your whole lay- over at Moscow airport standing in a queue to get through security. The food was almost inedible and my Chinese travelling companions played cards on the backs of the airline seats throughout most of the flight and all stood up to get their bags out of the overhead lockers when the pilot announced that we would be landing in three minutes! The cabin crew went almost apoplectic.,Economy Class,1,no,226,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2015-03-25,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,4,We made a reservation for 16th March 2015 to fly from Budapest via Moscow to Bangkok with Aeroflot airlines. Arriving at the Budapest airport we noticed that our flight SU 2031 which departure must have been at 12.50 was changed to 14.40 without any explication (delayed or something). We know we'll miss our connection to Bangkok so instead of arriving in Bangkok at 8.30 we were late 2.5 hours! That is why we had to call our transfer agency to not come to pick us up at the Bangkok Airport before 11 o'clock. So our short stay in Bangkok was shortened 2.5 hours!,Economy Class,1,no,227,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2015-04-03,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,9,I flew Aeroflot with a connection in Moscow. On my 10 hour long flights we were served two meals! The food was very good considering it was airline food. It was hot with plenty of bread and salad. Free wine was served throughout the flight. We were provided with slippers blankets pillows and eye shields. The staff were very courteous and announcements were made in Russian and English. The entertainment had a terrific selection of movies and music. If you are a tall person you are better off purchasing the emergency exit seats as they were so much more comfortable for someone 6'. Connection in Moscow which I was a bit fearful of was actually a very nice experience. They accepted US dollars. Most sales people spoke some English. Free wifi in coffee shops. The cleanest airport I have ever been to with janitors cleaning the toilets constantly wiping down all chrome pillars in hallways. Sparkling clean. Connections were smooth where my check in luggage went straight to my destination without having to recheck. The smaller airbus for my 4 hour flight to Venice did not have any entertainment video but did serve a meal. I recommend Aeroflot as great airline for the price!

2015-04-19,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,7,ARN-SVO-BKK return on new A320 and B773. Flights more or less on time. No problem with transfer. Good in-flight entertainment on B773. Food in economy just OK. We got an upgrade to Comfort class on BKK-SVO which was great. Big seats and plenty of leg room. Food also better - but not sure if better because of Comfort class or because made in Thailand. I don't like Aeroflots bread buns wrapped in plastic. They ought to have fresh bread. I also think all passengers on all long haul flights ought to be given 05 litres of water in bottles. Only difference to other European 3 and 4 star carriers appears to be the no alcohol policy. If a bit better food - and maybe a bit better English for some staff Aeroflot could easily be a 4 star airline.,Economy Class,1,yes,230,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia
2015-04-22,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,1,Flew from DUS-SVO-BKK. I am at a loss of words for the unfriendly staff. We had the feeling that they were annoyed about our presence in the plane. I have never experienced such unfriendly staff in my life. In addition 4 hours late without even explaining the delay. The Inflight-entertainment system itself was not bad. I would say slightly below average but still okay. The problem were the headphones. The headphones were so bad that you could not understand a word. So we could not watch a single movie during our 10 hour flight. At least no movie with sound. Food was standard. Neither good nor bad. I would not complain if the price would have been low. But it was pretty much the same as other airlines like Emirates or Etihad. 1/10 will never fly with Aeroflot again.,Economy Class,1,no,231,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,Aeroflot,Russia

First time Aeroflot but never again. A list of disappointments: All announcements were in 3 languages: Russian English and Japanese even the sales and priority rewards announcements. During the 9 hour flight we only got a cold drink once(!) even during dinner we didn't get anything to drink other than coffee or tea afterwards. This was a day flight and I didn't sleep so I didn't miss anything I'm sure. 1.5 hour delay which is perfectly acceptable for me but don't let us board and tell us every 5 minutes that the delay will be an extra 5 minutes (and in 3 languages again). The sign ""fasten seatbelts"" was lit for 3/4 of the flight but I didn't feel any turbulence at all seemed like the stewards didn't want people to stretch their legs.

2015-06-13,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,8,"This was my first experience with Aeroflot and I was pleasantly surprised with the airline. In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers.

The flight from LED to SVO had a delay and although we were told that the connecting flight would wait for us as (because of the re-booking) there would be a large group of SXF passengers on board, it did not. But directly upon entering SVO airport a SU representative would hand out pre-printed new boarding passes and a beverage voucher, so no need to go to a transfer desk. I found that quite professional. The aircraft used were in very good shape and we found seats and legroom far superior to most western airlines. Crews were dressed in very attractive uniforms and were quite fluent in English. Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language. The transfer in SVO (as well as entering Russia in LED) was quick and smooth (performed by traditionally grumpy staff, though).

In Rome we found out that our flight to Tokyo was cancelled - crew on the airport wasn't very helpful, but the call centre proved to be the best solution to sort us out and we had our tickets rebooked for direct flight with Alitalia to Tokyo Narita. So the 1st leg we didn't fly with Aeroflot (if not for the call centre we would be probably stranded in Rome). The return flight on A330-300 was better than we expected - 3 or 4 yrs old aircraft with a decent amount of leg space (in comparison with Alitalia it was better), pretty good IFE and really nice food - sushi and seafood pasta which I can say was probably the best onboard meals I've ever had. SVO-FCO in A320 was also nice, good Recaro blue seats and again pretty good meals. Service wasn't smiling a lot, but was attentive and my and my group really enjoyed the flights.

The bassinet option was only available in business class. The temperature on the plane was extremely high. It was unbearably hot for the whole duration of the flight.

The night before I was to fly I called Aeroflot to reconfirm, and was told that she couldn't confirm my reservation and that I would have to check in with the NY Aeroflot office when it opened at 9AM the next morning. The flight was scheduled to leave at 11:50 AM. No explanation, no apology, no nothing. Fortunately the agency that had made the original reservation has a 24/7 help line, and the agent I spoke to there was able to discover that the plane I was booked to fly on had no seating configuration for Premium Economy. The only seating choices were Economy or Business - this from the airline that had accepted a reservation and payment for a Premium Economy seat 4 months before. I have no problem with airlines having to change equipment, but I think it's fair to expect them to notify affected passengers about changes in the seating configuration. If I hadn't called, Aeroflot would have sprung this on me at the airport, when my only choices would have been to accept the downgrade to Economy or upgrade to Business for an additional $3K+. Instead I cancelled the reservation and rebooked Economy on Finnair, where at JFK I was able to purchase a Premium Economy upgrade on one segment for 60 Euros, and where I got a free upgrade to Business Class on another. I booked Aeroflot originally because I had heard that they had substantially improved their inflight services, and perhaps that it still true. Since I never got on the flight, I wouldn't know.

We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one. There were only two seats per row, which meant they were really wide. The downside was that we hadn't been able to select seats in advance, and I noted that the first row of seats was empty and would've preferred to have been seated in a row on my own, where I could get up freely, rather than next to a stranger, whom I had to disturb if I wanted to get up. I wasn't even able to select window seat or aisle seat, which I think is unsatisfactory. Other than this, you felt like it was a proper business class flight - we even got toiletry bags, blankets, and a gift of speciality tea to take with us on landing. Apart from not being able to select seats, it was far superior to the KLM business flight that I took on the return flight. Having said that, the staff - though efficient - were rather 'cold' in their manner (never smiled and never exchanged pleasantries), which is a sharp contrast to the KLM staff on the return flight. (But this might reflect Eastern European professional culture - I experienced similar cold, but efficient, professionalism once in a 5 star hotel in Tallin.)

This was my first Aeroflot trip after 15 years, so I was quite surprised at how well they position themselves as a decent airline. The cabin was clean and generally well-kept, toilets almost spotless, food was edible and there was even choice between two main courses (chicken or beef). Flight attendants were polite and attentive, although some of them assumed a rather condescending attitude with some passengers (a FA said to a 15yr old kid next to me: 'Ok, just because you said please I will give you another chocolate bar!') Safety instructions were pre-recorded in an impeccable Estuary English, the captain and FA's English was not that good, even if better than I remember from the last time I travelled with Aeroflot. You are still not allowed to use any electronic appliances during takeoff and landing though - which is really annoying, especially if other airlines (BA) have long abandoned this restriction. There was no inflight entertainment in the Economy cabin and no WIFI, however that wasn't important for a 3-hour flight. The ground crew is much less impressive though - our flight was 30 minutes late, yet the boarding attendant didn't volunteer any information re cause of delay and for how long we would need to wait and only announced the delay after being urged by me and only in Russian (I had to translate it into Italian for non-Russian speakers.",Economy Class,1,yes,280,1,1,1,,A321,Solo Leisure,SVO to MXP,January 2016,1,,Aeroflot,Russia

This is annoying if you just want to sleep. So first they serve cold drinks, then 15 min later they serve food. If you haven't ordered anything specific you only get meat.

Tel Aviv to Moscow in a Boeing 777-300 in Business. Comfortable seats, nothing out of this world, crew very polite and friendly, especially the ladies. The males seem more reserved. Cultural thing in the Russian service industry? The cabin was almost empty, but attention was lacking, apparently there were two VIP passengers onboard, and the crew gave them most of the attention. I had to ask for water twice. Most Airlines supply you with a bottle of water to begin with. Lunch service very long and food portions and quality average at best. Transferring in freezing Moscow (-6c) by bus to the Narita bound aircraft, no special bus for business passengers, its ok by Aeroflot to pay 5000usd per ticket and to sit in a frozen crowded bus for a long time. Onboard a charming welcome as usual, but business seats in the A330-300 too hard, an extra mattress is needed like many other airlines do these days to increase comfort. Dinner service took long (3 hours from take off to finish) leaving us with 6 hours to sleep, but wake up call (optional) for breakfast is 2 hours before landing, leaving passengers to sleep 4 hours or give up breakfast. WiFi for a fee in Business is unreal. Purchased a 10USD package that expired before one site could be up. Waste of money. Didn't use again the whole trip (4 segments). Return NRT-SVO-TLV, the first portion again on A333 but in Economy! My request to have four seats for myself and my 11 yr old son, so he could sleep was answered by ""we are completely full"" - so moved us to a two seater by the window. After takeoff I counted at least 10 rows of 4 seaters with one or two passenger at the most. So much for telling the truth. The agent could have blocked the seats between us, and release them for others if need be. For someone who paid so much for those tickets, I expected more cooperation. I asked to check an upgrade fee, but the ticketing agent took over an hour to calculate the difference in fare, but failed to come up with a confirmed rate. We gave up, as we wished to eat and shop, and didnt fancy waiting so long at check in. Was that rocket science task?  Onboard crew less friendly than the usual, seats painfully crowded and very little padding. Food was average again ,most Japanese around me left the food untouched. IFE ok, but sound tracks in bad quality, with much background noise. One cabin crew smashed her trolley against my knee, very painful, but except ""sorry"" nothing else. Moscow Transit was OK, and a packed Boeing 777-300to TLV. SU joined the misery club of 3-4-3 seating in economy, simply the worst. You keep rubbing shoulders and arms against a stranger, thank god it was 4 hour flight only. On a longer one it would have been a nightmare. Crew this time friendly and hard working, its really the ""shining star"" of Aeroflot, but the hard product must improve to make them attractive.

Aeroflot service can be very good, but, nonetheless seems to be inconsistent. My outbound flight on SU2579 on November 25th from London-LHR to Moscow-SVO reflected very high service standards, as the staff on board were attentive and charming. The return trip on November 29th from SVO to LHR was, however, mediocre, even allowing for my class of travel (economy). The cabin crew seemed to have an indifferent attitude, in stark contrast to the outbound flight. One flight attendant tried to tell me in a peremptory way to sit down again once we had arrived, even though the plane had come to a complete stop at the gate and the engines had been switched off a few minutes before. The flight took off from SVO with a delay of over an hour, which was explained as the result of a technical problem. However, no detailed explanation, which would have been useful, was given, and the cabin staff did not know the reason, which they should have done, I suspect it was an APU issue, as the cabin was freezing until the engines were started. Nevertheless, the captain managed to reduce the delay to 45 minutes by arrival. One significant advantage of flying Aeroflot is the Moscow airport it uses, Sheremetyevo. Domodedovo (DME), on the other hand, is now unpleasantly overcrowded, with long immigration queues.",Economy Class,1,yes,317,1,1,1,,A330-300,Solo Leisure,SVO to LHR,November 2016,1,,Aeroflot,Russia

I love the documentary on Soviet cars. The crew was smiling and I had a special very good Thai menu. I had a special luggage, a gun, as I compete internationally. The first good news is that Aeroflot includes it in the whole weight allowance contrary to many companies that charges extra fees up to 200 US dollars. I was advised at the plane door that my gun was on the plane to Moskow. In SVO also I was welcomed by an agent before the security check who took again the bag tag number to be sure that it will be on the plane to Zurich.

First flight from Ho Chi Minh City was almost full up to Xmas time with long queues at Check-in.

Full service onboard. Alcohol limited to two wines which were only served at meal time – and they ran out after 5 hours. Two meal services were offered on this 11 hour flight. In both cases were there two options for hot meals. Food was surprisingly good, managed to try all four hot dishes offered as passengers next to me offered me some of theirs as there were plenty. The scoop of the trip was somehow a surprise round of tasty, Russian ice-creams served quickly to all in the middle of the flight where blood sugar was low. Nice thought! Menu cards (in Vietnamese, Russian and English), earplugs, slippers and eye-masks provided. Spacious seats with ample leg room, slept well. Power Outlets. WiFi proclaimed but did not test. Call buttons answered. FAs could be worse, could be better (at times quite hostile, at times very cooperative). Aircraft clean, staff were well dressed, and hard-working. I see the rising quality-trend of Aeroflot. IFE had huge amount of movies and stuff on personal monitors. Quite some of them could not work.

As ground staff told us the reason of delay was 'late arrival of an aircraft'. As crew told us the reason of delay was 'slow work of ground staff'. Boarding was hectic and not well organised. I saw a vacant first row economy seat. I had a special meal booked but the cabin crew forgot about this. I had to remind them and they at first refused to provide it.

2017-01-26,"""abysmal service displayed throughout the entire journey""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Beijing via Moscow. My only reason to write this review is to warn other Skyteam members not to fly with Aeroflot. From booking to flight, aside from the planes being relatively new and a lower price than the poor standard Chinese airlines there is no other reason to fly with them. Despite being a Platinum member I was unable to book any economy comfort seats nor even an exit seat, they are all blocked for Aeroflot members only - and on the London to Moscow leg all the exit seats were empty and we were not allowed to move to them. On the 9.5 hour Beijing leg there are no extra legroom seats as they are only available on the 777's, so you are on an aircraft that most airlines use on medium haul with only 30 inches legroom - the cabin was crammed with people all over the place and as normal rather large people at that with legs in the aisles. Check-in was supposed to start at 7.40 but we waited until 8am whilst listening to the staff stories about the night before whilst they drank their coffee, the start of abysmal service displayed throughout the entire journey. Flight left 1 hour late and then at Moscow was delayed again by 1.15 whilst they de-iced the wings. The food was not only poor it was inedible, and I had the same AVML meal on both legs plus no alcohol at all, and when questioned all I got was a curt ""we never have any"" reply. Why on earth not? There is no religious reason on flights to China and even China Eastern has 2 bottles of red and white. Lounges were typical Eastern European, absolutely packed and with no hot food whatsoever, I managed to find some coleslaw and sweet bread plus some Chilean wine to keep me going as I'd eaten nothing for over 6 hours. Entertainment system was zero on the flight from London, not even a communal TV nor any music, and on the Beijing flight it kept breaking down. At no time did any staff walk around with drinks, there are no snacks available not even noodles and if you press your call button they do not answer. I can only assume that the reason to travel with them is the price, it was a terrible experience from start to finish.

In Moscow no information about flight until the departure was delayed from 21.15 to 02.50am. No information, only from the screen. I went to the transfer desk becasue the lounge personnel couldn't help at all, their language skills just okay but not sufficient for lounge staff, no chance to rebook on an evening flight to PEK (there was one). At the transfer counter I was told that the eco passengers were booked in a hotel while business class passengers should return to the lounge and wait. Shortly later the flight was delayed to 03.50. In the end we had a delay of 06.49 hrs. No compensation, no proper information, no special care, just sitting in the lounge. The flight SU 204 was okay, no idea how the meals were, too tired.

Not much pleasures onboard apart from an OK working IFE system on the long sector only. Very strict at check-in in CPH and had to rearrange luggage twice as to meet practiced requirements as they deny more than 10 kg hand-luggage. I had no privileges in their FFProgramme, so could not claim much rights, apart from being entitled to 23 kg according to the tickets which was very cheap (450 USD return, purchased online almost a year earlier. 6 months ticket). Service onboard mediocre on the short haul, but for the price paid, you’ll survive. Transfer in Moscow very quick and smooth, less than 5 Minutes for security and immigration check. On the long haul to SGN (12 hours+) hot meals (2-3 options!) and drinks/wines were served for the first half of the flight until they “ran out” (not true, its merely cost saving or fear of drunks). Hot meals were very good: supper service offered 2 options and breakfast 3 hot options. Wines were surprisingly good, to my taste they were excellent and well chosen. IFE the best I have encountered and easy to operate. Good value for money, but please travel light. Got 75% miles to their FFP, which will be enough to a long-haul upgrade after 3-5 more legs. Staff onboard professional though appear more cynical than truly caring. Load in economy approx. 75% full for both flights. Was lucky and had 4 seats in a row to stretch out though next to the toilets. Luggage delivery in Saigon took 1½ hour, likely the service provider messed up.

Flights were on time, seat comfort was good, food, drink and in-flight entertainment were fine. In-flight service was excellent. It's true that seat comfort could have been better, it's not as good as say Garuda or JAL, but it was good enough to get some serious sleep when needed. The ground service and boarding experience was poor, slightly chaotic and without air-bridges. Also cabin temperature seemed a bit high and airless, especially when compared to Qantas or SQ.

On check in at Moscow the staff were rude and refused to check me in as one of my bags as it weighed 24kg instead of 23kg, even though my 2nd check in luggage weighed 12kg. They told me to take 1kg out or pay 2000rur or they wouldnt let me fly. Out of the 46kg I was entitled to take I only had 36kg and ended up having to take 1kg out of my luggage and hand carry it onboard. There was only 1 person scanning boarding passes for economy passengers with no help and no proper queue so all customers were just pushing to get to the desk to board. This was highly unorganised and not pleasant. We had to board on a bus even though we were flying on a full B777 while smaller A320's and B737's sat at the gate making the boarding process very uncomfortable . The plane was one of Aeroflot's oldest B777's. The USB charger was broken at my seat and one of the toilets was out of order. They hadn't changed the entertainment from April to May even though they provided the May entertainment guide. The food was terrible and they ran out of the food selection I wanted due to the way they were serving food (back to front rows). For breakfast I got a buckwheat porridge however it wasnt a porridge at all, just a tray full of cooked but dry buckwheat. They don't serve any alcohol on an 8hr flight - if you want some you have to pay for it and if you want a snack you also have to pay for it.

I have done this trip before, and not much had changed from previous times. The flight was full as always. No alcoholic beverages are served on the domestic flights inside Russia. The main language is Russian (understandably) but flight attendents and announcements are done in English as well. There is no ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling from the flight attendents, but they are professional. Boarding the plane is all-at-once, chaotic. Best to be near the front of the boarding line, since Russians have a habit of trying to carry-on everything and the overhead bins fill quickly. Be prepared to board/unboard at Sheremetevo via a stairway on the tarmac after a short bus ride from the terminal. The meal served on both flights was a beef sandwich with cheese, horseradish sauce, and a pickle on dark bread, with a small fruit bar and a mandarin orange. Not great, but for a short flight it was better than most budget airlines. There was a delay out of Sheremetevo for mechanical repairs - While boarding we could see a mechanic tightening lug nuts on the A231's tire.

The seats are comfortable enough, with a good leg room and a good width even with the 2x2x2 seat plan, six seats in a row. In compare with, for example, Finnair business class with fewer seats in a row, the Aeroflot B777 seats offer little less privacy, because they are closer to the aisle, but the width of the seat itself is good. Considering the lower price of the Aeroflot business class ticket, it's a very good deal. Nice detail: a pillowcase sealed in a plastic bag was included in the blanket/pillow set.

Flight cancellations are not rare occurrences, of course. However, the way Aeroflot handled the cancellation left a lot to be desired. I was notified by my travel agent initially via email and apparently, was extremely shocked. I then phoned the agent but to no avail and given that there was no after-hour support in my region, I called their reservations hotline in Russia, only to find that some of their staff did not even speak comprehensible English. To complicate things, they denied the reservations code they themselves supplied, claiming that there was no numbers but only letters, when it clearly contained 2 numbers! After a rather unproductive 5-minute conversation where the staff kept prompting me to repeat and verify the reference code, they asked me for the ticket number. Guess what? They then forwarded me to another service agent, kind of implying it was a special case and they couldn't handle it. When I was finally connected, I was asked to supply the reference code again and they once again said their reference codes do not contain numbers. Of course, that member of staff also ended up asking me to quote the ticket number and sounded hugely impatient when I said ""hold on let me retrieve it"" with a long and deep breath. Mind you, it took me less than 15 seconds to retrieve it. When I finally started quoting the number, that staff member did not respond until I repeated a few times the first 6 digits and the deafening silence caused me to think the call was interrupted. Yet, after a few ""hellos"" he finally went ""CONTINUE!"" and that was one of the most impolite commands I'd ever encountered in phone conversations with airline personnel! To make things worse, he then said he needed to check my booking details further and put me on hold without even saying anything like ""please hold the line"". After waiting for 20 minutes, the call was disconnected and no one ever rang me back.

Unfortunately, each Aeroflot flight undermines my pride. I have been dissapointed, when my flight Moscow to Yerevan was cancelled without any prior announcement. I was waiting in Sheremetyevo to check-in my luggage (only two counters were opened for international flight passengers) just to find out that my flight is cancelled. However, one can see ""on time"" mark on the timetable. My husband was at that time flying to Moscow from Berlin to catch the same flight. Dut to the weather conditions, I expected the cancellation to happen, but what happened next, demonstrates the complete lack of Aeroflot`s ability to organize the passenger flow in such situations. My husband eventually got stuck in the transit zone with the flight information ""on time"", no Aeroflot personnel and people, who were sleeping on the mattresses! He found an Aeroflot representative only after an hour of running through different terminals of Sheremetyevo airport. At the same time I was literally fighting to get the same-day-flight to Yerevan (2 ladies at the counter for over 200 passengers), while the Aeroflot representative was extremely impolite and borderline offensive. Eventually, I got a flight 3 hours later (which got delayed for 3 more hours), and my husband managed to get a flight 3 hours (plus 1 hour delay) after my delayed flight. Waiting time at Sheremetyevo was more than 10 hours. We could not even fly together. They still had seats but they pointed out that it ""is too difficult for them"". No food or hotel were provided, not even a bottle of water. Anyway, the whole time all I wanted to hear was: ""We are sorry for your inconvenience. Your possible options would be"".

Aeroflot found us alternative flights with Thai airways - not entirely stress-free, but they got us there. The return from Hanoi to Moscow (delayed by 30 minutes) was on a tired and fairly grubby looking aircraft. The toilets smelled strongly, and half way through the flight they ran out of toilet paper and tissues - these were not replaced.

While the crew were professional and polite, the white wine (only 1 glass allowed for some reason), was warm and the food mediocre.

2017-08-26,"""my case was still in Moscow""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Tokyo via Moscow this month. The airline did not load my luggage on to the connecting flight in Moscow not once, but twice - on both my outward and return journeys. I flew to Tokyo from Heathrow with a stopover in Moscow. Unfortunately, the first leg of the flight was delayed by an hour or so (with no reason given). As a result, I was rushed through the airport in Moscow and was frantically ushered on to my connection. When I arrived in Tokyo Narita I was informed that my case was still in Moscow. It was two days before I received it at the address I was staying at. I did consider the idea that this could happen again on my return journey three weeks later, but surely not? Oh yes it could. This time there were no delays, yet when I returned to London I was told that my bag was still in Moscow and could take a day or two to be delivered to me. I was given a number to call that looked suspiciously like a mobile number and told that they could not guarantee when I got my bag back. Early the next morning, I tried to call to find out where my bag was. The number given went straight to voicemail. I tried to call it several times, but still nothing. I then tried to call the baggage customer helplines. All three numbers were busy and I didn't succeed in getting through to anyone over a five hour period. Calling the baggage handler responsible for Aeroflot at Heathrow was also useless, and they passed me another mobile number that also didn't answer. I then tried calling the Aeroflot desk at Heathrow, and was grateful to speak to a human being. The lady was very kind and eventually called me back to say that she had found my bag, and I could come in to collect it myself. I will never fly with this airline again. It seems there are lots of similar cases of this kind of thing happening in Moscow SVO airport. ",Economy Class,1,no,372,1,1,,,,Solo Leisure,London to Tokyo via Moscow,August 2017,1,,Aeroflot,Russia

When we were queuing to board the plane we were called to one side and told the flight had been overbooked and as we had the longest connection time in Moscow we had to wait until the flight the following morning. We were put in a nearby hotel and went back to Heathrow in the morning and got on the next flight. On Aeroflot flights there's minimal drinks on offer, water, orange juice, or wine out of a paper cup. The food is okay, and the seat comfort average. When we landed in Hanoi we found out our bags had not come on the flight with us but the staff did not know where they were, nor could they tell us how long they would take to reach us. This is a huge problem when you're travelling around Vietnam for a month and in two days would be 1000 miles away from Hanoi where the bags would be delivered. We were given a number to call to check on the status of our bags but every time we phoned we were not given any information. A week later we were told our bags had been found. We arranged for them to be sent to hoi an where we picked them up. Absolutely no compensation from the airline, not even an apology. On our return flight our flight was delayed by 5 hours which meant we missed our connection. This would have been okay if Aeroflot arranged a hotel for us until the next flight the following morning. But instead we had to fight our way (literally) through queues at Moscow airport with hundreds of other delayed Aeroflot passengers to get our connecting flight booked, which was a 7am flight the next day. We were then told another rep would arrange our accommodation at midnight, the time now was 9pm. By midnight there was no sign of any rep. Other frustrated passengers started demanding information from the staff that were around but it was no use. At 3am we gave up and went to the gate to wait for 4 hours. The gates were full of hundreds of passengers, including babies and children, on airbeds they were handing out of a room at the end of the terminal. We queued for a further hour to get an airbed. By 4am we were on an airbed and had a couple of hours lay down in the cold airport before our flight to Heathrow.

The recline was adequate, but could have used higher feet elevation. Staff were attentive and friendly. I packed enough essential items on my carry ons in case the actual luggage got lost, since so many complaints of losing luggage, ours arrived on our destinations just fine. They are Very strict on weight of luggage, they will weigh the carry ons 10 kg max each and the regular luggage 23 kg max, I almost had a problem in Venice. My husband and I were allowed 2 check in each total of 4, we were checking in only 3 so we had ample extra but I packed the bags 24 kg, 25 kg, 15 kg. They insisted to move the luggage around even though we could have more. So make sure to pack under each suitcase. The food in flight was delicious, they had sea bass, halibut, beef brisket,etc. Even for 3 or 4 hr flight they served a full meal. However, they serve the drinks first, so don't finish the drinks or ask for 2,if you like drinking during your meals. The movie selection was adequate, the headphones are 2 prong, they only distribute once the plane is in flight so bring your own if you have one. There is a USB charger. People bring pets in the plane, small dogs,etc. The lady next to me wanted to put her dog by my foot, and I refused, they should be made to buy business class for more space, plus she put her dirty, bare foot on the food tray to elevate, which was gross, and she ate there! At the airport they sometimes bus you to the smaller planes, and it is cold! Bring warm clothing, thick jacket, scarf, hat. The waiting room in Moscow airport are small, I would find an empty waiting area and head to our terminal once we are closer to boarding.

2018-02-21,"""airline is terribly overpriced""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Moscow. Overall, the inflight experience is OK, but nothing special. However the airline is terribly overpriced. The cheapest option you will find for Amsterdam to Moscow is at least €300. There are no other airlines flying this route without stop. It surprises me to see this airline, selling tickets from Amsterdam to Shanghai from just €350, but Amsterda to Moscow from €300. Note, that Amsterdam-Moscow is just a continental European, 3 hour flight with no onboard entertainment or anything special. KLM flies the same route charging the same prices. Now, I am flying monthly to Moscow, but not anymore from Amsterdam, but from Brussels, as it saves €100 per flight. I am strongly considering to fly with a layover in Riga from now on. Despite being an Aeroflot bonus member, and taking 23 flights last year, I have never been upgraded to anything, and never been recognised as a customer. On the contrary, when I had to change my plane tickets because of making a mistake with the dates (I contacted them within 1 hour after booking and went to the office within 2 hours after booking), they insisted that I had to pay, despite other airlines who change it for free within a reasonable timeframe. It was cheaper to apply for a new Russian visa with different dates, rather than to change the flight dates.

I fly this route frequently on business, and have experienced more positives than negatives. First, the flight was near capacity, as always. The flight was smooth, seat was comfortable, food was bland but palatable. However, the flight was anything but uneventful. Just before beginning descent into Moscow Sheremyetevo, a woman walking down the aisle to the bathroom approaching me appeared faint and collapsed. I and a couple other passengers kept the woman from falling hard and lowered her to the floor. This was when the flight attendants jumped into action. The head attendant coordinated the staff, helping care for the woman. They asked for a doctor on the plane and fortunately there was one. The woman appeared to be having a diabetic episode, and the doctor attended to the distressed woman in the seat behind me, assisted by the flight attendants. All during the incident, the flight attendants were calm and professional. They did an excellent job of managing the situation, especially during landing and deboarding of the aircraft, managing the arrival of medical crews to assist the woman, while at the same time ensuring the safety of the passengers.

I think this should be seriously re-thought, it is the same way on all long haul Aeroflot flights. The biggest issue however was at arrival when two of our suitcases came totally damaged, we have reported this at the airport immediately, were advised to log the given report via Aeroflot website within 7 days, now we received answer - very rude, lots of exclamation marks, asking for whole set of documents, new statement from us? for what - the report was done at the airport, copy of the passport, etc. Any airline can have a nice plane, but they can make a difference when something goes wrong and in customer service, apparently still long way to go with Aeroflot.",Economy Class,1,no,408,1,1,1,1,,Family Leisure,Male to Moscow,February 2018,1,,Aeroflot,Russia

I really enjoyed the possibility of using WiFi on the Boeing 777, it really makes a long haul flight less ""long"". Don't expect to be streaming YouTube etc., but paying $5 to be able to use WhatsApp in-flight is a really nice feature in my opinion. The legroom on the Airbus was decent, however the legroom on the Boeing was a pain. Sadly, this is the case with almost all economy classes nowadays. The in-flight entertainment system was nice as well and it offered some good movies. The food was okay, especially the dinner, but the breakfast wasn't very special. They offer enough drinks.

At the boarding there was a small confusion cause some people from connecting flights were called separately and everybody thought that boarding started. Plane clean, comfortable seats, a blanket on every seat. Cabin staff is also very friendly, good language knowledge, however no IFE. What really made me angry was the food. Theoretically you can choose between chicken and beef. Practically even if there was chicken, it was out a few rows before me.  I left my warm meal, bread was tasteless, sweet not much better. On the back flight similar positive impressions about the plane and crew. As this was Rossiya flight for Aeroflot only cold meal was served. Sandwich with thick slice of Russian bacon.

Aeroflot apparently introduced a new dedicated counter for Business Class. So now they process separately Business class, Sky Priority and Economy passengers at the check in. Which might be a good idea at the main Aeroflot airports. However, in Prague it creates a lot of problems, confusions and discomfort. In the past, there was just common Business Class/Sky Priority counter and two for Economy. In this particular case, they checked in all 4 Business class passengers at one counter, 10 SkyPriority passengers at the other counter and all the remaining approx. 150 people at the single, remaining counter. In the past, they had two counters for economy, serving on average. 75 people each. Consequently, the new regime effectively doubled queues (and check in time) for economy passengers, but offered only a very little or no extra comfort for business passengers. Moreover, it disturbed the whole process, because people waiting in a very long queue were continuously trying to sneak in into SkyPriority. It is odd to see one clerk doing nothing and the other being up to their ears in work.

I booked economy assuming the business class seats would be the standard coach with the middle seat left empty as with BA, AF, SAS etc. Nice to see someone flying with the 2+2 layout common for business class in North America. Enough space to actually get a laptop out and get some work done. Gate agents in Prague were friendly and quick, equipment (A321) was brand new.

2018-08-08,"""left a poor impression""",4,"✅ Trip Verified | Moscow to Istanbul. Aeroflot is definitely not a premium airline it thinks it is, because their economy experience is simply embarrassing. Moscow - Istanbul was on a 5-year old Boeing 737-800, but the cabin looked like it was 15 years old with no maintenance. Everything was scuffed, slightly teared, shaky etc. The seats were unbelievably, and I mean it, unbelievably tight. It was seriously painful to sit upright in the seat, because if you are of average height, your knees will be firmly pressed into the hard and rough metal bar, which is conveniently located right where your knees are supposed to be. The fact that the armrests were quite wide made the seat even less spacious. I lucked out in not having a neighbour in the next seat, but I seriously doubt it I would have handled the flight if it was 100% full. The cabin crew were grumpy and sloppy (with one exception), and their attitude regarding safety was unbelievable - they just didn't care. They never properly checked the cabin before take off and failed to enforce the safety rules (since they cared so little), so the plane took off with open tray tables, closed windows, passengers laying across the seats with no seatbelts, passengers streaming something from their devices with no headphones. I have never experienced anything like this, I felt like this was a bad dream or a good comedy, but it was neither. The meal service was alright. I ordered a kosher meal, which is always a fine choice on Aeroflot, and it was much bigger than the regular meals. Nothing extraordinary, plastic cutlery, no menus, but it was fine. There was no wine, beer or any other alcohol onboard, not even for purchase, which is just so embarrassing for the ""best airline of Eastern Europe"". I must also note that their main full-service competitors on this route - Turkish Airlines and Atlasglobal - both serve beer and wine, and their meals are much tastier. There was no entertainment onboard. You could apparently stream entertainment via their wi-fi network, but it kept failing. The landing in Istanbul was really rough, and then the plane spent 20 minutes slowly driving through the airport. The passengers thought it was a great time to stand up, open the overhead bins, start packing while the plane was in motion and something could easily fall down on someone's head, and the crew did nothing to stop it. So, once again, major safety hazard. Istanbul-Moscow was another story. It was Boeing 737-800 with the same seating chart, but the plane was newer, and the seats were better. Their design allowed for more legroom, and while it still wasn't spacious, it was tolerable. I still don't get why they decided to have a magazine pocket at the top of the seat (which is a great idea for maximising legroom) and at the knee level as well, because that doesn't make any sense from any perspective and shows poor management, but at least there were no metal bars this time. The seats felt super flimsy and cheap, though, with the whole row shaking and creaking whenever someone moved. I wonder if this plane will age well, because it seems like it will not. Cabin crew were much more pleasant this time around, and they actually made sure the people were seated with their seatbelts on. No wine or beer once again. The kosher meal was exactly the same, which was fine. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes with no explanation or apology. Overall, Aeroflot left a poor impression, and I will make sure to avoid it.",Economy Class,1,no,436,1,1,1,1,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Moscow to Istanbul,August 2018,1,1,Aeroflot,Russia

First, they departed around 40 min late from Havana which caused me and several other passengers miss the connecting flight from Moscow to Istanbul. They were rude and not providing any decent help or assistance at Moscow airport. Their staff can dare to ask you ""what do you want?"" when you're trying to get help after stacking at the airport. We had to wait for the next flight to Istanbul for 4 hours. Yesterday I flew back to Havana from Istanbul. It departed around 1,5 hour late from Istanbul and there was 1 hour 50 minutes time in between the connecting flights. I barely caught the plane from Moscow to Havana, running all over the airport in Moscow with rude assistance ordering me like ""run, you have 3 min, no more!"". My ultimate destination was Cancun, Mexico so I took another flight from Havana (my luggage was checked in from Istanbul to Cancun directly so I didn't need to collect it until Cancun). When I arrived at Cancun, I found out that my luggage hasn't arrived. It was left in Moscow and supposed to be delivered next day (I'm still waiting as of Sep 12, flew on Sep 11.

Crew on both flights were friendly and polite. Hot meals (hearty, decent not overly sophisticated) and blankets on this routes made the service complete. Interestingly enough the flights were dry (no alcohol served). A huge amount of magazines are to be found in the seat pocket, the inflight magazine however was not interesting at all for international travellers since after 250+ pages in only Russian, a ten page english summary is provided. This is my major point of feedback; please be more considerate to non Russian travellers. I found the seats on the A321 much more comfortable (slim designed new seats with good legroom and personal device holder) than on the A330 (hard, more narrow, very limited legroom, made even worse by the hundreds of pages of magazines pressing against your knees, I'm 1,79m).

A pleasant surprise were European style and USB plug-ins. There wasn’t the traditional in-flight entertainment system, however Aeroflot is implementing a new free on-board system.

Basic things like what's next or where to meet, all not clearly explained. The information given was very limited. Staff attitude extremely bad and arrogant. It's already awful enough if you involuntarily have to spend a night extra because your flight is delayed. As for the hotel accommodation. It started with the check-in where  tired passengers had to wait in the bus, while tiny batches of people were allowed to check in. Once we got off the bus we had, additionally to our already four hour wait at the airport, wait again for half an hour to get our room cards. Three hours before check-in I already knew that I'd be staying in Novotel, how come they were not prepared and just handed over the keys. What terrible logistics!! In the morning after shower I found there was no body lotion and toothbrush. In the bathroom it said: if you need anything just call 75. Which I did, only to receive a rude reminder that I'm not a 'real' guest and should get the items at the reception myself. Once I went to this reception, the chap didn't even understand what I wanted. So together we called 75 and now they delivered.

Having seen negative reviews, we (two adults, three kids 3-10 yo) decided to leave a review here too because we found the airline was excellent in many aspects. Check-in: no hick-up. It was opened two hours before flight, maybe due to Prague's policy, not airline. We wish the airport/airlines may consider this as we found the immigration at Prague was excruciatingly slow, almost deliberately by the staff who manned the counter. We were asked numerous questions and he perused through each passport very slowly without apparent reason. We made it to the flight a few minutes after boarding time had closed despite being number four to check-in. A few travellers were also late behind us.Thankfully Aeroflot waited for us! Our baggage were checked in all the way to Ho Chi Minh where we collected each of them safely. Food: We requested Muslim food. As the PRG-MOW was below 3 hours, special meal request could not be entertained (Aeroflot's policy). This is an aspect which the airline could improve. We came well-prepared with outside food and were not told off by the steward/ess. Orange juice was particularly nice. From MOW to SGN, we were provided with Muslim meal in a very well-presented boxes. It came with halal certification information booklet by a Russian halal authorisation agency. This is much better than the handwritten or sticker of MOML as in other airlines. Aeroflot scores highly from us for ensuring total confidence over the food that they serve. In flight magazine: They certainly have listened to complaints and we are happy to report that they have an in-flight magazine in English, in addition to the thick Russian one. Good job Aeroflot! We now have Nov and Dec 2018 issues as part of our collection! In flight entertainment: Aeroflot may have the largest selection of movies to watch in addition to excellent games for kids. They also have good selection of local (Soviet and Russian) hits. Every passenger was supplied with earphones. The quality of the screen and audio was excellent. 5. For kids, they received two different sets of bag/toy/stationeries/games for the two legs of travel. Very nice bag that my youngest keeps wearing everyday even after a week off the plane! Very nice touch from the Aeroflot! 6. Cabin crew were polite and gentle enough throughout the flight, at check in counter and when speaking with the kids. Amenities on board were also good including blanket, socks, soft slippers and eyemask on the MOW-SGN. Overall cabin experience was great. The flight was warm, clean and spacious enough with reclining seats, and lift-able armrest, allowing my kids to sleep on my laps. Overall Moscow Sheremetyevo experience was excellent. Immigration was polite and quick. Airport facilities were great. There is even a family room at Terminal D which could be booked for free to up to 24hrs by a family that has at least one <7 yo. It has beds for small kids and sofas for older ones, a playing room, nappy changing room, basic kitchen (for warming baby foods and hot water) and private toilet. It is manned by a personnel who just need to be shown the passports and boarding passes. We used 12 flights for this particular trip, and Aeroflot scored highest. It was a positive experience for all of us. We were not expecting this as the price was unbelievably low for PRG-SGN (below MYR1000 per person).

The problem is that her case with the two surfboards did not reach Moscow and cannot be found. Because of the language limitations of the workers in the field she could not understand the fate of her baggage. One representative told her that the sails would go directly to Colombo. Of course, the two surfboards did not reach Sri Lanka. Then they were told that in Moscow and again after a long clarification they were not found in Moscow either. In another email, I was told that they were in Barcelona and wanted to know where to send them. Happy  I gave them the address of my home in Sri Lanka. Yesterday I received another email, claiming that despite the previous email, they were not even in Barcelona. We do not have a place where the surfboards, my daughter is a week on a surfing trip without surfboard. ",Economy Class,1,no,464,,,,,,Solo Leisure,Tel Aviv to Moscow,December 2018,1,,Aeroflot,Russia

The transit in Moscow airport was chaotic. Massive non-organized queues of more than one hour the made at least 150+ people to miss their following flights. Another chaos at the Aeroflot counters where I had to elbow and push for two hours to get my boarding pass. Not enough staff for the amount of people stranded. The 3 poor girls behind the counter did what they could. Again, unorganized queues and lack of sensitiveness toward families, children, elderly people who could not struggle to be near the counter.

The second flight was ok and normal, but the first one are both good and bad. Good point: Seat was really good, very wide and comfortable. I can lay down in a much bigger angle than economy and there is a footrest come out from below the seat. Food was really proper food. I attached picture below, they are served in real plates, not in plastic or paper box, and real knife and folks, not plastic. There are 2 meals during flight Beijing to Moscow, both are very well cooked, one main course with salad, side dish and desert. As an Elite Plus member in Skyteam from another company (Not Aeroflot), I can also enjoy the lounge from Beijing and lounge from Moscow. I attached the photo of moscow lounge, very good food, not very crowded. Negative points: Food was good, but too much salt in the main course. But overall is ok. When I check in at Beijing airport, and showed to the desk my Elite Plus member card, to use the priority checkin desk, lounge voucher, and priority luggage delivery. The girl in the counter spent around 5 mins to call China Eastern to validate if my Elite Plus membership are real. On the phone, she said my account number and my name, and ask if the name matches and which level is this number, even I already showed to her my physical membership card and also the online checkin result already showed I am ElitePlus. I asked why and she told me because many people are using fake cards and account number from other people to get the privilege for free, they have to double check manually. I can't believe they have to check it in this way, wasting time for everybody. They should have an easy IT solution through Skyteam. Biggest issue: After landing in Moscow, while the aircraft is still running, people rushed from the behind and crowded the aisle. Nobody from cabin crew tried to stop them.

We all stand around for 30 minutes and leave to go to the hotel. But there is only one lady checking passports so this takes 45 minutes. 12:15 We are on the bus.

She alerted staff at security check and was told to push to the front. Other passengers pushed her back shouting that they too were about to miss their flights. WIFI is almost impossible to use at Moscow, so without communications she was  very upset to have missed her flight. The staff at the airport were rude and unhelpful telling her it was her fault that she missed the connection, however with hundreds of other people all missing connecting flights it would appear not. She had to queue for another hour just to talk to customer service. With no other options, we had to book her another ticket at considerable expense and then told that her return flight was invalid, due to her missing the connecting flight. So yet another expense booking her flight home. One of the busiest times of the year, you can imagine how much money we have spent on these flights. Response from customer service took exactly 1 month. A long winded message to say, she checked in at Heathrow accepting the transit time and ticket conditions, so there is nothing they will do.

2019-01-20,"""they follow their rules""",5,"✅ Trip Verified |  Murmansk to Moscow. I have been flying Aeroflot frequently since 1995 and clearly seen the huge improvement taking place during that period. I am a Gold Member of Aeroflot Bonus and have been that several periods during my 11 years membership of the program. It is with disappointment that I note a decline in customer centricity since 2013-2016. Especially the last 2 years the airline have become a “paragraph referring airline”. Instead of being flexible with access to lounges for Gold and Platinum members with one guest (spouse) and child (non-teenager), they follow their rules and deny access in most of the cases. Big difference compared to few years ago. The same rigidity to upgrades to Space Plus in economy class, even with half empty planes. Snacks on short flights (1-3 hours) has been the same boring dark bread sandwich for over a year. When flying 6-8 flights per month, this sandwich loses its attraction after a few months. No variation at all. When addressing these issues to Aeroflot Bonus customer feedback desks, the same mechanical defense explanations appear, stating that “crew is just following rules” and do nothing wrong - or, “thanks for your quality feedback on meals, we will review this”, but nothing happens. Aeroflot until a year ago, was an airline I strongly supported and actually also promoted as much better than the reputation, but my experience in 2017-2019 have been flavored with negative impressions.

Outbound PRG-SVO leg with slight (30 mins) delay, usual drink + tasty dark bread sandwich. Only issue with Russian pax who always rush out of plane even before parked and push over the rows ahead (this is where crew should manage order), which causes stuck and safety issues. Swift transfer to terminal F (some 20 mins walk + passport check) in Moscow.

On the inbound, used again HKG express city check-in, no upgrade to C for HKG-SVO available (sold out). Flight again ok, relaxing and on time. First drink service before takeoff, hot towels before meals. I wonder why the crew did not offer paid uprage to Premium from Economy class in plane, as the PE load was some 30-40 % both ways on long hauls and this may bring additional gains. After almost 3 hrs delay in SVO due to heavy snow finally, the flight to PRG (last on evening) took off - we were not provided any meal vouchers or other assistance.

It's barely enough if the flight is on time - but, in my case, the Aeroflot flight from Copenhagen was delayed by 25 minutes. I have to say a few words about the official ground representatives of Aeroflot in Copenhagen. It was hustle and bustle, with lots of unnecessary movements. They made an impression of low professionalism. So the flight from Copenhagen departed with 25 minutes delay. The cabin crew on the flight CPH-SVO was also very hectic. I asked for a coffee and they poured me a warm liquid which barely resembles coffee. When I've told the lady about it and asked for the tea (if it's warm) I was met with very unfriendly face. The food had become very poor lately. I missed my connection to Saint Petersburg, I was rebooked for the next time, but barely had time to catch it.

It took 8 days to finally get my bags (my trip was only 12 days long). During those 8 days I sent emails, faxes and called the airline and lost baggage service (Q.A.S) multiple times and never received any responses. The only reply I got from them was due to a Facebook message I sent, which explained I need to contact the airline directly, not through their FB page. On April 24th I decided to go to the airport and look for my bags myself. They claimed my bags were not there, but I begged to check on my own and was finally allowed. Well, they were sitting right there in their storage room! It seems that when the bags finally made it on a flight, they had new tags put on - meaning the airline would have never found my bags, since they were searching for my old tag number. When no one claimed the bags, instead of searching their system to look for my claim, they issued a new claim to the case even though my name was on the baggage tag! Now, I flew back the same route arriving 4 days ago (TLV, SVO, IAD) and 3 of my 5 bags checked are missing! They claim it was due to a short stopover, but I had a 14 hour stopover!

The flight SVO-PEK was 1 h late in PEK as well, and I was put in Beijing in a hotel for 24 h to wait for the next Air China flight. My visit to ULN was planned as 2 days long, so I requested an Aeroflot agent to send me back to AMS, as my trip had lost its purpose. The Aeroflot Agent in Beijing spoke very poor English, and he ignored my request without a reason provided, but recommended to call to Moscow during office hours in Moscow (it was 3 am in Moscow at the time of this conversation) and discuss this with people from central office. As long as it would be too late then, and because in my experience Aeroflot client support is useless and helpless, I went to the hotel (the hotel was very poor and in a very strange location, btw).

My excess on the same amount of luggage I’ve travelled with for years came to £129, almost doubling the price of my ticket. It was extracted by the service staff, at times barely suppressing smiles.

She had given me a heads up that I would have to go from one end of the Moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight. She also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive. She knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before I did. The flight from Madrid to Moscow flight 2501 arrives at 5:50 PM at terminal D. Then you have to get though security to get to terminal F in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 7:05 PM from gate 57 at terminal F, which is the second to the last gate. I literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight. If I had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line I would have missed my flight. Once I arrived in Guangzhou, I was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day. So, why have a route so tight that will cause passenger's luggage to always arrive a day late?

2019-08-07,"""handled so poorly""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep.

If coffee then only natural not instant and cheap Nescafe. Tasty tea. I often fly and I have something to compare. All kids are given packages with toys - this is very nice! When we flew from Moscow to Bangkok the stewardess herself offered to transfer to the free lane where there were no seats in front which turned out to be much more comfortable :) At all stages of the flight there were modern and comfortable aircraft.

A lot of other passengers had the same problem and there was a very long queue where you had to stand for about 90 - 120 minutes before getting help since they had only had two people for this.

For all the time in the queue there was not a single announcement about the beginning or end of check-in for flights, which I initially did not pay attention to, but which probably played a decisive role in what happened. Having pre-registered online, I did not manage to check in my luggage until the end of registration. When it was my turn, they suggested that I fly without baggage. As a result, my granddaughter, 14 years old, who had no luggage, flew out alone, while I reissued a ticket at the ticket office the next day (August 8), for which I paid 5520 rubles. In addition to me, other people with similar stories crowded around the ticket office and they all asked the same questions: “Why don't they announce the end of registration? Why are company employees working so slowly?” I want to ask one more question: ""Why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane, but there is no time to complete the registration?""

Premium Economy is excellent value with comfortable seats, decent amenities, and big, filling meals. The only alcohol served is beer and wine; drinks service is followed immediately with meal. Oddly, the second meal on both transatlantic flights is served 3 hours before arrival which interrupts the chance for some hours of sleep. Announcements are continuous and interrupting; first, pre-recorded Russian/English followed by crew Russian/English announcements repeating the same message. Crews are typical, ranging from disinterested senior to pleasant, willing, smiling junior cabin staff. Services SVO-TSE-SVO on Airbus equipment with no IFE are similar with nice food, disruptive announcements and decent level of comfort.

I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation.

Cabin crews pleasant and working hard. Overall, great flights. The only problem is that they do not send relevant information to passengers, e.g. 24 hours before departure the departure terminal in the mail from Aeroflot was F, which was wrong, the departure terminal was actually D, a very different one far away.

I can honestly say some of the best cabin service I have received anywhere. Cabin staff were friendly and warm and accommodated all requests and did everything with confidence and style. All were also immaculately attired and turned out. For a three hour flight, not overly long, they got in three services, a food run, then tea and coffee and duty free and made it look easy. I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside. No IFE but to be expected on short haul regional commutes and didn't phase me and didn't expect any. So my overall experience with Aeroflot from Bucharest to Moscow return, was outstanding and enjoyable and I can't think of anything to mark down.

We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",Economy Class,1,no,576,,,,,,Couple Leisure,Rome to Tokyo via Moscow,April 2020,,,Aeroflot,Russia

2022-01-30,"""felt very rushed and unpolished""",5,"✅ Trip Verified |  Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.
