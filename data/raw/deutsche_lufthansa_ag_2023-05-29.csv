2014-01-06,Lufthansa customer review,9,FRA-DXB return flight. Very good service on the way out. Good flight nice crew very uneventful. On the way back almost as good. The 747 landed in heavy clouds and didn't feel a thing. Entertainment is ok but not at the level of say Air Canada. On the way back I asked for lactose-free meal and got one that was pretty good. A great airline and a great experience.,Economy Class,4,4,4,4,4,yes,1,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-07,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH 419 from IAD to FRA. The lounge in IAD is less than average for First Class. The first Class seats are good and LH provides a heavy mattress and bedding to sleep. However LH has a policy of keeping the cabin at 23 deg C which is just too warm to sleep with all the heavy blankets I wish they would cool their cabin to a normal temp. The food was ok but certainly not great. The service from the flight staff was excellent. Finding my connection in Frankfurt was quite difficult and took quite a while to find the first class lounge.,First Class,3,4,3,2,3,yes,4,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-07,Lufthansa customer review,10,DEL-FRA-SZB in Business. Check-in was easy the new lounge in Delhi has sufficient space free wifi and pretty good snacks and drinks. On board the lie-flat seats on the 747-800 were very comfortable and I had a good sleep. Flight was on-time and the breakfast before landing was very tasty (I had the Indian breakfast).,Business Class,5,5,5,4,4,yes,6,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-08,Lufthansa customer review,10,BKK-FRA-BKK. LH 783 18 Dec BKK-FRA. LH 772 2 Jan FRA-BKK. Lufthansa continues to have fantastic economy service. The air hostesses tend to be older than other airlines but their experience shows in the brilliant service given. The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. The food is similar to others in the same category. You can even order cocktails on long haul flights and they even serve with a smile. My personal opinion is that elder stewardesses or stewards can give better service than younger ones. Seat is hard and small inflight entertainment is good with choices of quite contemporary film material. We wish there were more toilets.,Economy Class,3,4,4,5,4,yes,7,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-08,Lufthansa customer review,7,IAD-FRA on B747-8 and FRA-IAH A380. Both flights were good. Friendliness in Business is much better than Economy. Good food and Service on both legs. Lounge in IAD with separate access gate to the plane is a plus. The new Business on the B747-8 let the old one on the A380 feel really outdated. It was hard to get a seat in the Z-Gate Business Lounge in FRA.,Business Class,2,4,4,4,2,yes,8,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-08,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 456 on January 4 2014. The flight from FRA to LAX was delayed 2 hours at take off due to first a technical problem and second an ill passenger whose luggage had to be removed from the airplane. At arrival the plane was only one hour late because of a higher cruising speed the plane was rather new (747-8) and comfortable the food was good - quite a positive surprise on a trans-atlantic flight. Only the cabin temperature was unpleasantly low - and this is rather frequently found in LH long distance flights.,Economy Class,5,5,5,5,4,yes,9,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-10,Lufthansa customer review,8,VCE-FRA-AMS on 28 December 2013 and then AMS-FRA-VCE on 3 January 2014. Flights were all nice and all on time on comfortable A321 and A319. It didn't make sense that they gave us food on 16:35 pm flight to AMS and not on 12:45 pm flight to FRA but this is just an insignificant detail. Staff was good and smiling and flight experience was good too. I recommend Lufthansa.,Economy Class,5,5,3,1,4,yes,13,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-13,Lufthansa customer review,9,Flight 490 from Frankfurt / Germany to Seattle / WA on January 6 2014. Very punctual smooth flight. On board service very good. Temperature in plane too low. Entertainment programme and internet service excellent. Digital flight information very good. Meal service fine except for oversight to remove moist cloth and empty cups/cans before serving dinner. Overall impression very good.,Economy Class,3,4,4,5,5,yes,14,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Check-in was easy and pleasant with brilliant ground staff in Tbilisi. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working especially on the MUC-TBS leg on 30 December. Hot food was served in MUC-TBS-MUC segments and it was very tasty both times. Lufthansa and Turkish are recommended airlines for travelers to Tbilisi.,Economy Class,5,5,5,1,5,yes,15,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,8,FRA to ORD. I slept most of the time on board so there was not much I had to complain about. Flight attendants very nice and friendly. Boarding in FRA is always very chaotic. It is much better organized in ORD. LH should handle the boarding procedure for FRA like they do it in ORD. I'd recommend that Lufthansa would send an e-mail notification when the plane changes so that passengers who book early can make sure that they can keep their reserved seat.,Premium Economy,3,5,4,3,5,yes,17,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,9,Frankfurt to Washington Dulles on Jan 8 flight LH418. Return on Jan 10th flight LH419. I have been flying Lufthansa for many years now both professionally and privately. It is not a cheap airline but I admit that I still use it for my private trips because of the impeccable quality of service at all levels. As a Senator passenger I know I get more perks but I see all the time the genuine attention that the staff puts in when dealing with every passenger. After having delt for many years with numerous american airlines I find this very refreshing!,Economy Class,3,5,4,4,4,yes,18,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-16,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 415 Washington-Munich. 10/11 Jan 2014. Overall very good. Friendly service. Good (new) business class seats.

The new 747-8 aircraft offers a modern ambience in the Economy class LH standard seats with individual now well-functioned entertainment system but still the usual limited space.,Economy Class,3,5,4,4,4,yes,23,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-20,Lufthansa customer review,10,Flight LH430 was perfect. New Business class seats are really good and comfortable. I've received the upgrade from the economy with no additional costs. Entertainment was ok but sleep on the plane was better and the traveler kit was very helpful. I'll do it again.,Business Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,24,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-21,Lufthansa customer review,6,It's always a pleasure flying with Lufthansa. The flight LH 490 was ready on time for departure and the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile. The aircraft was new and cleanliness in the cabin was satisfactory. This time there was no aerobridge and the boarding was via bus. This added to a bit of inconvenience to some passengers. The new Airbus cabin storage is comparatively small and passengers had to struggle finding a place to put their carry on luggage. Overall the food and beverages selection was good. I would highly recommend this flight to my family and friends.,Economy Class,4,5,4,5,5,yes,25,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-21,Lufthansa customer review,8,The flight (LH431) was as expected good. The chosen seat was good for my long legs. Departure and Arrival was nearly on time. Only the served breakfast was very poor.,Economy Class,4,4,3,4,4,yes,26,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-22,Lufthansa customer review,10,Flight DUS-MUC in the evening. Short flight from DUS to MUC. Friendly staff free Drinks (water tea coffee wine bear soft drinks) and savory snacks.

2014-01-22,Lufthansa customer review,8,Frankfurt - Rio de Janeiro - Frankfurt with Lufthansa on A340. On time smooth decent hassle free and without any problems. Extremely friendly professional and attentive crew on both flights. Cocktails served after take off really nice dinner. Large movie selection on personal screens. 2-4-2 seats making it easier for a couple to sit together. Absolutely nothing to complain if there was not the seat itself: Narrow uncomfortable and one of the worst of all my flights. Unfortunately different from other airlines economy seats.,Economy Class,1,5,5,5,3,yes,28,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-22,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH428. Positives: Smooth trip to U.S. Good service nice entertainment program nice food and drinks. To improve: Seat was in the last row of the plane and I didn't had so much space for my legs.,Economy Class,3,4,4,4,4,yes,29,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-22,Lufthansa customer review,5,LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. The flight went smoothly and on time (arriving ahead of schedule). No complaints about the flight conditions and service except the performance of the information/entertainment system. The touch screen was not responding thus making the use impossible. I see two main problems - the system is outdated and not properly serviced. However this was a smaller problem for me compared with the failure of the promised Wi-Fi connection.,Economy Class,4,4,3,1,4,yes,30,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-25,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH430 FRA-ORD Jan 20 2014 New 747-8. Seat comfort is inferior to most other airlines on this segment. Loyalty customer treatment (especially in regards to complimentary upgrades) is unacceptable seems non-existent all the way up to Senator (incl.) and might become real only with HON which is super exclusive. Food quality is average and staff attention in economy is also just average. Staff attention visibly improves from business class onwards. Inflight entertainment is a bad joke especially in economy as well as in any 'old' business or first class seat. Tiny monitors that are often defective. Fairly small movie selection. This is way behind the other airlines that LH wants to compete with. Economy seats in the new 747-8 are ok but seat comfort in the first economy aisle seat right behind business class is impacted by staff continuously pushing the blinds against the passengers legs.,Economy Class,3,3,3,3,3,yes,32,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-28,Lufthansa customer review,2,HEL-MUC/FRA-MAD return. I don't like their new loyalty program downgrade. I booked quite high priced booking class ticket last year hoping to earn more miles and to renew my Frequent Flyer status and loyalty with them just to be faced with the fact that earning miles is now 25% - 50% from mileage flown unless you pay full Y or C priced ticket. 23hrs check in before flight is useless 3 of my 4 flights were of change of equipment and I was automatically moved from reserved first Y row seat to the last rows of the bus. Very inconvenient as I had to wait a long time to get deplaned. Their onboard product has downgraded with NEK seat. 2 x 2hr 20min flight segments resulted me back muscle pain. Seat is so thin and narrow making noises when moving on it it is the most uncomfortable way to travel. Their refreshment offering is okay but snacks are inedible - no healthy and fresh options anymore. Cabin crew did their best service was professional with smiles. Lounge access was good as layovers were 3hrs 30min too long. Loyalty for this airline is completely useless for me I will change my loyalty to another Scandinavian carrier with better timetables.,Economy Class,1,4,1,1,1,no,33,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-01-28,Lufthansa customer review,9,Flight Abu Dhabi-Frankfurt: new business class seats on this night flight an absolute improvement compared to the old seat that is still in use. Wish all Lufthansa long haul seats in this class were already installed! Service on board really friendly and chatty. Nice snack and aperitif after departure good breakfast 1 hour prior to arrival. Could have been served 15 mins earlier but at the same time crew allowed us to sleep longer. Inflight entertainment improved as well a lot. The map/route should have music in the background. The new seat is perfect to sleep completely flat. Amenity kit is a plus. Smooth flight and professional service. A330 10 years old but in perfect condition. Welcome lounge in Frankfurt a nice place to have a shower and another great breakfast after this night flight.,Business Class,5,5,5,4,4,yes,34,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-01-28,Lufthansa customer review,7,Flew CGN-MUC on a Saturday. Onward flight was nearly empty so you could seat any seat. Two drinks one coffee and one apple juice on a nice Airbus 321.

One SMS informs customers that the flight is late another one about 1.5 hours later told customers the flight will be on time. When arriving at the airport it was late again. They are still doing averagely when it comes to pampering of their top status customers. There is hardly ever a complimentary upgrade while my US colleagues on US carriers get upgraded 75% of the time on long haul flights.,Economy Class,3,4,3,3,4,yes,42,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-03,Lufthansa customer review,9,Sao Paulo to Frankfurt and on to Madrid. Checked in for my flights and was treated in a courteous and friendly manner. Chaos at Guarulhos due to the construction work ahead of the World Cup. Our gate remained occupied by a TAP A340 with a delayed departure leading to being bussed to our 747 parked at a remote stand. Pushed back from the stand about 1.5 hours late and waited in a long line for take-off. Nice reception on-board and seated in a center aisle with the middle seat free. The service was excellent and the food of a decent quality with the usual drinks and wine of your choice. I have to say that I find the LH business class seat lacking in comfort and as it doesn't go flat is quite hard to find a comfortable sleeping position. It is time for a revamp of that seat. The entertainment selection is good and I particularly like one of the radio channels. Headsets are decent but not up to the Bose quality used by other carriers. This is an 11 hour flight so plenty of time to relax. Breakfast was good and I find the cabin crew to be of a consistently high standard. Fix that seat and this is a very competitive product.,Business Class,3,5,5,5,4,yes,43,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-03,Lufthansa customer review,7,I took the flight to Orlando from Frankfurt and back from Charleston to Munich. Sufficient space in Economy.

2014-02-04,Lufthansa customer review,1,As a very regular customer of Lufthansa I am normally a fan and very happy with the service they offer and provide. Unfortunately my last flight: Frankfurt/Los Angeles (LH 456) was an exception. Having been offered a complimentary upgrade to Business Class at the gate I was then downgraded on board back to Economy with minimal apology nor effort to find a suitable alternative. (I understood the issue as the Business Class seat had in fact been sold to a passenger on Business Class standby but given my status and the value of business I give LH every year it was disappointing). On this occasion the situation was made worse by a particularly difficult neighbor and some average service on board. As I said not a normal experience with Lufthansa but frustrating all the same.,Economy Class,1,1,3,3,3,no,45,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-02-05,Lufthansa customer review,9,"Frankfurt-Abu Dhabi-Frankfurt booked a special for 429 Euro in September flew in January - a 6 day trip. Excellent value for money. New A330 cabin with improved seats in economy class and brand new wireless inflight entertainment system which means no more entertainment box under the seats and therefore more legroom. System with good responsiveness high definition and you can even use your own headphones (""one plug""-system). Flight information system with satellite views is great! WIFI on board for extra cost available on most time of the flight. Staff service as always on Lufthansa efficient friendly correct and professional. Meals decent (1 hot meal 1 sandwich service) wide range of free (even alcoholic) drinks friendly welcome in the galley for more drinks. Hot towel service is always welcome. Only organization of boarding in Abu Dhabi should be improved too narrow waiting lounge for two flights at the same time.

2014-02-05,Lufthansa customer review,9,LH 435 Chicago - Munich. January 30 2014. Nothing to complain about flight was on time on board service in general was good however the only point I can complain about is that breakfast could have been better. I suspect that the reason for the quality of breakfast below what one could be expect from Lufthansa is that on flights from the US to Europe catering is done by a US company hence the quality of bread is quite poor.,Economy Class,5,5,3,5,4,yes,48,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-02-12,Lufthansa customer review,9,I flew from Philadelphia to Frankfurt. Plane was old Airbus A340-300 interior being in clean and good shape. Business having own check-in was nice staff being polite except supervisor having an argument with a customer at next counter. Almost better than real TV. For Business Class passengers there was own boarding lane. At Cabin boarding drink with choices were offered. Business class has lie flat seats but not latest fully flat yet. According to my knowledge Lufthansa is installing new fully flats on their fleet. During flight the service was nice first with cocktail and snacks. 15min later came food service with appetizers with choices. From three warm choices you can choose your main course. Wines were good and I slept rest of the flight comfortably and missed breakfast service.,Business Class,4,5,5,4,5,yes,51,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-02-14,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH418 FRA-IAD 8 Feb. It was a rather comfortable flight in a not too fully booked Economy Class cabin. My major issue with this flight was about the internet connectivity on board. Unfortunately again FlyNet did not work at all. It has become a rather unreliable service over the last few months. Seating comfort on the new 747-8 is rather good nevertheless when someone sits next to you in Economy it is really a challenge to survive a long-haul flight. The distance to the front seat could be improved but most likely will not. Again I have to point out that as a Lufthansa status customer (Frequent Traveller Star Alliance Silver) I am being treated better by United (complimentary upgrade to Economy plus priority boarding priority luggage) than by Lufthansa.,Economy Class,2,5,4,3,3,yes,53,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-14,Lufthansa customer review,10,LH418 Feb 9 2014. As a frequent flyer (and holding Senator status with the Star Alliance) I prefer to fly with Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners as they offer me the best routes to get me to my destination. On every flight I experienced good service the crew handled any extra requests with a smile.,Economy Class,4,5,5,4,5,yes,54,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-17,Lufthansa customer review,3,ORD-FRA-DEL. A typical mixed bag of service. ORD-FRA was supposed to be on 747-8 and I booked this flight specifically for this aircraft but they downgraded to normal 747 in the last minute. This caused chaos in ORD as they were short 16 business class seats all passengers had to be reassigned their seats which caused my family to be split up and in middle seats - at several thousand dollars each we were not happy. Crew tried their best but no one would move and we were seated all over the cabin. Food was mediocre at best on this route and angled seats did not provide for great sleeping. Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines. Arrival at DEL was a mess with business and first class bags off-loaded last which annoyed premium paying passengers. Only highlight really was LH Senator Lounge in FRA which was very nice. For the price paid I would try another carrier.,Business Class,3,4,2,2,2,no,55,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-18,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flight 457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt was delayed due a technical problem. Unfortunately there was no assistance for me at the arrival gate since my flight connection was half an hour later I had to rush pass again through the security check and immigration. I arrived breathless at the gate of my flight to Florence where we were told that they had to change the aircraft due to a technical problem. I had to wait for another hour. Concerning the service on board and the aircraft (a new B747-800) I have nothing to complain about.,Economy Class,3,4,3,3,3,yes,56,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-18,Lufthansa customer review,9,LH431 from ORD to FRA. These long haul flights now have wifi which was a pleasant surprise. Apart from that the cabin was not particularly full which made it easy to put the bag under the seat next to me etc. I suspect the comfort would be diminished if it was otherwise. Apart from that no other surprises the food was good the staff polite the flight was on schedule.,Economy Class,4,5,4,5,3,yes,57,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-20,Lufthansa customer review,10,Feb 18 2014: Lufthansa - LH1817 - Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC). This segment was part of a five flight itinerary with United Airlines a review of which can be found under their name. This particular Lufthansa experience was as always superbly efficient on the ground in both Barcelona and Munich. Navigating airports at either end was a breeze and the embarkation and disembarkation process easy and smooth. The flight itself had both an on-time departure and arrival and the in-flight service was as expected superb and efficient as one would expect from Lufthansa. Always a treat to fly with Lufthansa and will continue to do so whenever possible.,Economy Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,58,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-20,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 410 MUC to JFK 1st Feb 2014. The flight was fully booked but it was ok. Crew very friendly. Since I was sitting at rear I had only one meal left to choose. The space for my feet was very limited because of some mounted housings under the seat in front. Too little space to place something like a bottle of water and a book. Plane was new and in good shape.,Economy Class,3,5,4,5,4,yes,59,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-21,Lufthansa customer review,6,Unfortunately we were unable to use the online check-in service on the Lufthansa homepage. This service is apparently unavailable when you have a connecting flight in Los Angeles (LAX to FRA) and come from the Big Island of Hawaii - Kona Airport for that matter - meaning that our 4 tickets were scattered all over the plane. Luckily this problem could easily be solved by a friendly member of the Lufthansa ground staff in LA. The flight from LA to Frankfurt was okay overall seats on the 747-8I are not the most uncomfortable though a little too lightly padded. Dinner and Breakfast were offered - both were quite good. The inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies in various languages (sadly variety was not that great) the flight attendant were generally nice. We would recommend Lufthansa.,Economy Class,3,4,4,4,4,yes,60,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-24,Lufthansa customer review,9,Early-morning feeder flights from to Frankfurt and back outbound on a brand new A320 return on an older plane with newish cabin. The core product is rather basic both in terms of comfort and services but the planes were spotless the crews extremely professional and the slimline seats at least provide decent legroom. LH still serves nice breakfast and drinks even on these short hops and there is really nothing major to complain about. One thing to improve is seat assignment in economy which tends to get really messy at times.,Economy Class,4,5,5,1,5,yes,61,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-25,Lufthansa customer review,9,EWR-MUC 19/02/2013 LH413. My travel experience was great. From check-in to lounge and boarding it was very smooth and easy. The flight itself was relaxing food and drink was excellent and the staff very friendly. In the end we were even 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I wish flying would always be like this experience.,Business Class,4,5,5,5,4,yes,62,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-02-25,Lufthansa customer review,6,Disappointed with the recent Buenos Aires to Frankfurt flight. Several crew members seemed rude and unmotivated when an elderly lady boarded with a light and small suitcase the flight attendant refused to help her stow it away. Other occasions the crew were not helpful: to a family travelling with small children removing food plates instead they walked over it and complained about it. Other than that service was been ok flight attendants served passengers with water and juice several times during the night in addition to the self-service bar area with small snacks and beverages. Dinner was ok breakfast was very disappointing. Unfortunately there are not many alternatives on this route. However on the outbound journey the crew both on ground and on board were much nicer and all flights were on time.,Economy Class,3,2,3,4,3,no,65,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-26,Lufthansa customer review,10,LH456 FRA-LAX 21 Feb 14. Great trip with LH new aircraft nice and enjoyable/humoristic crew. Nothing to say on the service although the seats do need an upgrade it does not contribute to the full experience as the entire flight overall is good. The entertainment system (AVOD) is easy to use although late responding but with a good selection of films music and travel information. Overall a very nice experience and flight.,Economy Class,4,5,5,5,5,yes,66,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-02-28,Lufthansa customer review,9,Flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Great value for money. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment could be improved for instance a more modern and larger movie selection as on other competing airlines. Considering that the flight was 180 Euros cheaper than Singapore Airlines I was very satisfied.,Economy Class,5,5,5,4,5,yes,67,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

I was seated in the main cabin in row 16 (first row in coach class). For an overnight flight it is recommendable to aim for a exit row seat since you cannot stretch your legs and the arm rests are firm.

I had short connection (45 minutes) in Munich and the plane departed half hour late from Paris.

As we protested we got two new seats in the back of the airplane at least two seats on the aisle. Why did nobody tell us as soon as the reserved seats were not available anymore?

However I fly a lot with LH and the staff are always lovely. No shortage of beverages and smiles. Wide network and travel through good hubs. The lounges can vary some good some not so good.

2014-03-24,Lufthansa customer review,2,I took a round trip from FRA to LAX for business. During the flight back the cabin was freezing cold. I was sitting in the rear part of the aircraft on the window side. The supplied blankets are completely ineffective because they are made of wide mesh kind of fabric that still lets the cold air pass through that is coming from the overhead ventilation slots. In the end I had to wear my winter jacket all the time. The lady next to me also complained and was sitting there with a thick winter jacket scarf cap and gloves.,Economy Class,4,5,4,4,4,yes,107,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-03-24,Lufthansa customer review,10,I flew on the new 747-8 from IAD to FRA. The aircraft was amazingly comfortable and the seats in Economy are definitely an upgrade from previous LH Eco-seats.

2014-03-26,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH431. Seats are terrible - the person behind you only has to touch your seat and it feels like a punch in the back. In addition when the person in front of you decides to use the reclining function it's almost impossible to move or get out of your seat. You have to follow suit in order to have some breathing space. A second glass of wine for dinner would have been nice.,Economy Class,N/A,2,2,3,3,yes,112,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-03-26,Lufthansa customer review,1,My 9.30 LH309 flight on 23/3/2014 out of Florence Italy was cancelled due to rain. Only one Lufthansa representative was available to rebook the entire flight's customers. After retrieving our luggage waiting in a long line to rebook through your only available representative in Florence we were to board a bus to take us to Bologna leaving at 13.00. It actually left at 14.15. No representative guided us with instructions on which bus to get on. When we arrived in Bologna one Lufthansa representative said to get into Line 35. When we approached the Lufthansa representative at Line 35 she got annoyed that we were in the wrong line. When I pointed out the gentleman who told us to get in her line she grabbed my ticket and approached that man. She came back without my ticket and told us we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the flight. Finally I got out of line and approached the man showed him my passport to get my ticket back. The meal voucher we were given in Florence was not honored in Bologna. Finally we got our baggage checked and seats assigned in Bologna 2 hours before our flight. When we arrived in Frankfurt no representative was there to greet us and walk us to where we were to get hotel vouchers. The whole experience was awful. Stress levels could have been lessened if Lufthansa people were well-informed and actually gave us correct information and were there to actually meet us and show us where or what we had to do. Walking around the airports in Bologna and Frankfurt with luggage on a wild goose chase because Lufthansa representatives didn't have a clue or gave us misdirection's was very bad mismanagement of customers and very poor customer service. I understand they cannot control the weather but Lufthansa CAN control the information given to customers after a cancellation and actually have representatives in place to guide us at each airport.,Economy Class,2,1,1,1,3,no,113,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The food was correct (coach standards) but the choice was poor. On the inbound flight to Seattle we got twice the same choice pasta or chicken. Even if they were prepared and cooked differently it was the same choice. I believe it should be possible to offer a 3rd type of meal (fish or meat).

Other than for the unfortunate strikes which delayed my original flight plan I found the ground personnel and the flight personnel always helpful polite and very professional. I also appreciated having been warned at least 48 hours ahead of time regarding the strike. It gave me enough time to reschedule and change my itinerary.

After over one hour on the phone with the representative I was offered a free of charge rebooking for April 4th ironically the 3rd day of a well pre-planned strike. The representative knew less about the strike and the cancelled flights than I did! After that useless option was given I was offered a seat on the 5th which unfortunately by this time was making the entire trip pointless. I asked for a refund LH declined even if they failed to deliver their part of the transaction.

2014-04-02,Lufthansa customer review,7,"CCS-FRA-TXL and return aboard LH FirstClass in March. Inbound flight was excellent A330-300 with new FC. Check in in CCS was a 5 min thing very efficient and friendly. In CCS they use the AA Admirals Club for FirstClass lounge which was average limited drink selection no food not even snacks. Boarding was fast. Crew were nice and caring Seat was comfy but not as comfy as it looks. It's a lie flat where they put a ""mattress"" on but still quite hard to lie on but at least you can stretch out. Food was good but not outstanding. Transit in FRA is a mess CCS flights always got remote parking no gate! You have to climb off the plane get into Van take a 15min ride to Arrivals B then walk 30+ mins through Immigration customs on to Departures A. Senator Lounge at A Gates is like a luxury hotel full breakfast buffet smoking lounge showers full bar and great service. FRA-TXL leg is only 50 mins they put you in Business in lack of a First in these flights. Return flight was scheduled for March 27 but cancelled due to strike. They rescheduled my flight on the phone for March 28 no problem. TXL-FRA left at 6 am on time. Getting from Arrivals A to Departure C in FRA is disgusting. Endless walking (40+ mins) plus a trip on a train for people with moving limitations almost impossible to handle. Senator Lounge at C Gates very good but not as splendid as the one at A Gates I mentioned before. FRA-CCS decent service same food experience ( same menu) same good vodka same "" so-so"" seats. Nice inflight entertainment with large flatscreen good selection of actual movies and TV series. On time arrival in CCS very fast bag service with FirstClass bags unloaded first.

Plane was completely full passengers were greeted at the entrance door. Friendly and highly professional was the attitude of the 5 flight attendants. Meal service consisted of a warm dish (chicken with vegetables and wedges) a roll with butter rice pudding and a small bottle of water followed by two rounds of drinks. LH still has one of the most generous choices of free drinks non-alcoholic of any kind plus red and white wine sparkling wine beer etc. Announcements from the cockpit were short clear and informative. The cabin design was okay and clean. Due to the thin recaro seats space is sufficient even for larger people.

I was surprised to find out that they had a different lay out so no extra leg room. Thankfully economy section 30% full so I jumped in the seat in front of the bulk. The seat was quite comfortable. Food and beverages quite good. On time performance. Now on the below par section. The cabin was extremely cold and the blankets were small and thin. Complaints made but nothing changed. IFE a bit old without remote control tough to navigate on a low resolution screen. A worn out touch screen with ok variety on movies though. Poor audio and the headsets completely useless. Cabin crew quite the opposite of ANA crew on my inbound FRA-HND. Actually robotic. No smiles no interaction. They served lunch 30 minutes after take off and then disappeared. Only one of them seated in the galley area with a tray of water and juice on a self service mode. After 9 hours they served a dinner box (again as in lunch there was a choice between Japanese and Western). Priority on my luggage was not honored in Athens as my suitcase came out after 20 minutes waiting on the carousel. All in all a below par flight from LH.,Economy Class,4,2,3,3,3,yes,134,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Could have been more appealing for the snack 2hrs before landing. A hot napkin before landing would be a plus.

I was very satisfied with the overall experience on my Lufthansa flight although I would hope for a few additional movies on the inflight entertainment recent releases in particular. Staff were friendly and meal choices okay. Sometimes offers e.g. for Bailey's/Cognac after meals are only made upon request so you need to pay close attention when a flight attendant comes by.

2014-04-19,Lufthansa customer review,6,FRA-SIN-FRA on A380 in economy. Flight was cheap left/arrived on time and meals were fine but those were the only real positives. Fortunate to snag a seat with no seat in front so endless legroom. All other seats in economy looked ridiculously cramped. Seat itself was extremely uncomfortable for the 12 hour flight and the constant prodding of the touch screen from the passenger behind is a little annoying. (Unfortunately this is the only way to operate the screen as the remote is basically useless) Entertainment system would have been ok but crashed 3 times. Am Lufthansa 'Senator' status which helped in being able to secure one of the best seats (53D) other than that absolutely no recognition of so called status on board unlike Air New Zealand where one feels welcome pampered and valued - even though it is not my 'home' airline. All in all pretty sad for such a proud airline.,Economy Class,2,3,4,3,3,no,147,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-19,Lufthansa customer review,8,Madrid to Bogota via Frankfurt. Excellent flight to FRA with good hot breakfast of Spanish omelette and spinach bread and jam with plenty of drinks! Upgraded to business class with my partner using miles. Only issue I have with Lufthansa was the transfer to Terminal C which includes having to exit and go through security once again which is always slow at FRA airport. Senator lounge in C very nice and cosy with direct door access to the gates. Service onboard to Bogota was excellent despite my food choice not being available even third row into the business class. The food portions are smaller but the drinks service made up for that with the crew members being super nice and efficient. I have always enjoyed Lufthansa since 15 years in general but the new miles and status earning system is somewhat disappointing but perhaps necessary with the overcrowded lounges and lack of free seats when using miles.,Business Class,5,5,3,4,5,yes,148,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

There was no business seats from FRA to EBL even though they passed it off as business class. Just the same as coach. It was a 4 hour flight. Absolutely dreadful! Then in business class on the A380 the seats do not go horizontal therefore I could get no sleep as my body was being pulled down.,Business Class,1,5,2,3,3,no,151,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

I value the professionalism of its workers. The only two issues they should get better are the entertainment onboard in economy class where you find fewer movies compared to other airlines and the new calculations for the mileage system in 2014 which makes it more difficult to retain or gain frequent flyer or senator status unless you spend more money.,Economy Class,4,4,4,3,4,yes,152,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-04-23,Lufthansa customer review,7,It has been a long-haul transatlantic flight in a new 747-8. The baggage drop security check flight and arrival have been uneventful and ok. The service onboard was good but not outstanding. After less than ten rows serviced the choice of meals was already reduced to one (pasta). The quality is comparable to supermarket convenience food and tends to be lower than in previous years - in variety as well as in general quality.,Economy Class,5,4,3,5,3,yes,154,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-24,Lufthansa customer review,8,I flew flight 434 from Munich to Chicago (ORD) on their A340. The plane was new beautiful and the flight attendants were pleasant. I had the chicken with rice meal option and it was good. I enjoyed the white wine and the staff was very good about keeping the passengers' glasses filled with water juice or soft drinks. I had the calzone instead of the quiche for the snack prior to landing. It was only okay and I was disappointed that a fork and a knife were not offered with this option. The IFE (in-flight entertainment) options were adequate. During the flight I watched two movies and enjoyed the spa/relaxing music option. To summarize I had a good experience and believe I got good value for my money. I would recommend Lufthansa.,Economy Class,5,5,4,4,5,yes,155,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-25,Lufthansa customer review,7,FRA-BCN 22 April Economy award ticket. This was an expensive (paying with miles) ticket from LJU to BCN. The first flight was on Adria and its new CRJ900 aircraft. FRA-BCN was on LH economy departure 4 mins before time bearding with 2 jetways to A321 which is very rare. Cabin crew were just regular. No special attention towards top tiers full flight basic food which included a small sandwich and a drink. Well groomed staff and maintained aircraft. Arrived (touched down) in BCN 6 mins ahead of schedule but lost 20 mins due to taxi and outside parking position even if a lot of gates were empty. Lufthansa is keeping itself above water saving even where savings are impossible charging more for taxes and lowering earning levels of Miles & More. After 25 years and complete dedication to LH I will not re-qualify for Gold status anymore.,Economy Class,4,3,2,1,3,yes,156,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-28,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 415 IAD-MUC on April 21 2014. This flight offered the cabin service as it used to be with friendly and attentive flight attendants which created a nice relaxing atmosphere. The inflight system was new and worked very well especially when comparing to the e.g. A380 (eco) which are terrible. Flight was very good however it all depends on the crew. I also experienced very bad and disinterested service (lately LH 462 A380 FRA-MIA on April 13 with unclean toilets right from the start and stressed personnel).,Economy Class,3,5,4,4,4,yes,157,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-29,Lufthansa customer review,4,FRA-SFO LH454 13 Apr 2014. LAX-FRA LH457 25 Apr 2014. First class flight inbound: Seat was broken. System needed to get re-started 4 times during the flight then adjusted manually. Food: salad was unenjoyable. Main course (beef fillet) looked very good but was tasteless. Service onboard not first class at all. Slow and not attentive. Lounge LAX: great facilities. However very thin food offering. Business flight outbound: Entertainment system crashed 3 times. Old business class seats.,First Class,2,2,2,2,2,no,158,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-04-30,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH456 and LH9242 on 10 April. Good product and Service - Shared flight with United Airlines was awful (not a thing I was looking for as I booked Lufthansa). Employees were most of the times quite nice. In-Seat-Entertainment in 747-800 works horribly (touch screen). Planes are cleaner than others from other airlines but still somewhat dirty - cleaning should do a better job and crew must check it prior to boarding.,Economy Class,4,5,4,2,3,yes,159,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-01,Lufthansa customer review,7,IAD-FRA LH 419 20/4/2014. New 747-8 reduction of engine noise - good. Seating - in view of economy class - good. Meals - breakfast lousy.

Reaction time of inflight entertainment system very slow.,Economy Class,4,3,3,3,4,yes,160,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-01,Lufthansa customer review,4,Very positive experience. Only one major complaint: the distance between the rows of seats is very short. I am only 175 cm tall and weigh 65 kg but feel cramped in when the seat in front me is being reclined back I have no choice other than also tilt my seat back - even if I don't want to.

2014-05-03,Lufthansa customer review,6,May 2nd 2014 LH 413. Excellent cabin service. However I was unlucky in getting one of those ancient First Class cabins with seats which should be in a museum. I think it is unacceptable to offer such a First Class product when many Business class seats of other airlines are way better. The usual new FC is good though but the old one must be replaced.,First Class,1,5,4,2,2,yes,163,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-03,Lufthansa customer review,10,ABZ-FRA-TXL on 737-500 and A320. Lufthansa clearly stands out on European routes for me. 1) All classes include checked luggage and they are generous when it comes to weight limits (I had 28 kg no problem whatsoever). 2) Very generous bar service even between FRA and TXL (50 min flight time) they served drinks twice. There is always a snack and on international routes a proper sandwich which makes a difference with for example BA or Air France where they still serve lousy crackers on international (European) services. 3) The cabin crew are lovely has humour and also treats Economy Customers as important guests.,Economy Class,4,4,4,3,4,yes,164,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-03,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew MAN-FRA-BOG round trip last week. Overall was I was impressed with Lufthansa and would fly with them again. IFE is good if a little dated. FA's are very professional courteous and friendly. They were helpful with every request that I or other pax around me had. The aircraft (B737 A346 and A320) were clean. I opted for the vegetarian meals and was impressed with taste and quality. My only gripe is the seat pitch in economy. Thankfully I had a spare seat next to me on FRA-BOG outbound otherwise it does feel a bit cramped for a 180cm person like myself. I would travel with Lufthansa again.,Economy Class,3,4,4,3,4,yes,165,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,8,Went First Class FRA-MIA on the A380 21st April. Excellent service on all levels. Comfortable seats low cabin noise - very pleasant trip. Went Washington - FRA on 26th on the new 747-800. A not so pleasant flight. It took two hours to get the inflight entertainment system to restart but service was good otherwise and the same type of seat in the A380. My preference although is the 747-400 with the first Class on the upper deck - much more space and more quiet.,First Class,4,5,4,3,3,yes,166,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,9,Several flights in April: Rome via Munich to Sao Paulo and back from Rio de Janeiro via Frankfurt to Nice. All Lufthansa operated. Consistent quality on all flights: All on time (some ahead of schedule) very professional and courteous employees on board. I don't understand why their cabin crews have a reputation of being cold and robotic. Not true at all. Very service orientated. Seats improved on long haul flights. I liked the new inflight touch screens like an ipad - easy to use large and better variety of movies. Food as always very good departing from Germany and only average from Rio. But beverage service (also alcoholic) excellent nice snacks like Milka chocolate bars in the galleys throughout the flight. Airbus A340-600 much quieter and nicer to fly than even refurbished 747-400 back from Rio. Munich airport simply great to transfer. Frankfurt new Z-area a great plus. Baggage handling despite short connexion time good. Always arrived with us. A great way to fly very recommended!,Economy Class,4,5,5,5,4,yes,167,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,7,YYZ-FRA-TLV on April 30. YYZ-FRA leg operated by an older 747-400 instead of the usual A340-600. Aircraft was refurbished and offered personal touch screens; seats were rather thin and uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. I ordered a vegan (VGML) meal which included steamed vegetables and plain rice food was ok but lacked proteins and flavour dairy granola bar and margarine were provided which was annoying. Free beer wine and spirits were offered. Staff were courteous and professional. FRA-TLV leg was in a high density A321 seats were about 2 inches thick very hard and uncomfortable for the 4 hour flight. Food was surprisingly good and much better than the YYZ- FRA leg. No entertainment was offered. Service was extremely professional and courteous. Overall pretty satisfied and will definitely fly again.,Economy Class,3,5,4,4,4,yes,168,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,5,LH 454 FRA-SFO 16 April 2014. LH 457 LAX-FRA 30 April 2014. Inflight entertainment and movie variety improved. Seat comfort is ok. No major difference to other airlines' economy. Staff service and friendliness is varying between employees. No consistency in friendliness and service. Food and beverage services take very long until guests are served. Breakfast is poor in terms of quantity content and quality. Just one additional beverage service after lunch/dinner. No sleeping masks provided.,Economy Class,3,2,1,4,2,no,169,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,10,Departure LH 431 on April 16th and arrived LH 430 on May 2nd from Chicago O'Hare. Lufthansa had a Boeing 747 for this flight and it was great with individual TV’s for movie watching. Air hostesses had great attitudes and served with a smile. It was refreshing to see a good service throughout and made the long flight bearable. Only suggestion I would make is to provide more and better choices for movies. This is especially critical for long flights.,Economy Class,5,5,5,4,5,yes,170,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-05,Lufthansa customer review,7,"LH 419 from IAD to FRA April 30th. Good Airline in terms of flight schedule and punctuality.

Arrived DFW around 4 pm was told only option was to take their chartered buses which did not depart until around 10 pm and arrived IAH around 0230.

2014-05-06,Lufthansa customer review,10,We had two flights in business class from Malaga to Dusseldorf and then to Heathrow. The flights were what we always have (and expect) with Lufthansa. Flights are on time boarded efficiently smiling staff tasty food and a nice sized chocolate treat. Some of the passengers are grumpy and impatient. The staff from Dusseldorf to Heathrow April 12 were some of the best we've encountered. A great sense of humor. No inflight entertainment but there isn't on any of the short flights we've seen in Europe.,Business Class,5,5,5,1,5,yes,173,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-05-07,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH410 3rd May 2014. Good quality and price unfortunately the temperature of the cabin was too low. Several passengers required to increase the temperature to the crew without satisfaction. Low rating for seat comfort is related to this reason.,Economy Class,2,4,3,4,4,yes,175,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-07,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH456 on May 4. This was a standard Trip on Lufthansa's Boeing 747-8i and the exit row window seats in economy are almost perfect for a daytime intercontinental flight. The entertainment systems performance was a little sluggish first but recovered the longer I used it. Food was OK for Economy service was as you expect from Lufthansa. As a premium customer you get individually greeted here and they even offered to bring a round of premium drinks from the Business class selection. The only pain point was that one of the lavatories was broken so the lines were bothersome all the time. I wonder why such a Premium plane does not get fixed before heading from FRA to LAX.,Economy Class,3,4,3,4,3,yes,176,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-08,Lufthansa customer review,7,May 5. Flight LH 430 from Frankfurt to Chicago. I was little bit disappointed because the TV did not work and the foods I wanted were out. But other than that services were good.,Economy Class,4,5,4,2,4,yes,177,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-10,Lufthansa customer review,8,DUS-EWR. Lufthansa has improved many things in the past which was also more than necessary nothing to complain on this flight crew was also unusual friendly.

2014-05-11,Lufthansa customer review,2,On a direct flight Munich to Los Angeles I found myself in row 39 (economy class) of an aircraft with a downstairs bathroom area. The bathroom configuration is a great innovation but next to my seat loomed the very imposing cover for the stairway to the bathroom. Mine was the inside seat of only two in that row because of the stairway. My elbow bumped into the stairway wall and my vision was totally blocked on that side. Claustrophobic alley! A kind attendant was able to reseat me. Meals? The plane departed at noon and lunch was served at 1 pm. Lufthansa has been touted for its meals and I was looking forward to this part. The meal itself was good from my experience with airplane food. A few hours later an attendant passed out Toblerone chocolate bars. Several hours after that more chocolate bars. Mind you this was a direct flight. It landed 12 hours after it departed. The passengers had last eaten a meal 11 hours earlier! I think most people would need at least a sandwich or light meal in that 11-hour period. There were no meals for purchase on board no help in sight. I think Lufthansa definitely needs to look carefully at their meal policy for such extended flights. If I ever travel on this airline again I'm bringing my own food!,Economy Class,1,4,1,5,3,no,179,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

From ground staff through flight service to after touch down. It's a completely different way of air travel. It's expensive of course but you know exactly what you're paying for. Besides that it's even better when First Class is an upgrade.,First Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,182,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-11,Lufthansa customer review,2,We were scheduled to fly out of SFO on April 3rd UA1169. Then to Addis Ababa on April 4th: LH419. Unfortunately we were not notified of the pilots strike until Wednesday afternoon April 2nd. We went to the SFO airport on April 2nd and were unable to obtain alternate flights that day. After several hours Lufthansa scheduled us to go through Seoul Hong Kong and on to Addis. However in the arrangement the last leg of our return flight on May 3rd had been deleted from the Lufthansa reservation list. The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles. That flight left and arrived on time. Then we found we had no reservation from LAX to FAT. It was not a good experience! I have flown Lufthansa for 40 years and will continue to do so however this trip was not good for us.,Economy Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,183,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-12,Lufthansa customer review,9,Just flew Munich - Sao Paulo on a A340-600. Flight was packed. Very attentive and nice cabin crew: I did ask for a sleeping mask was told it is meant for business class passengers. But I got one delivered 3 minutes later: very nice touch. Cabin crew almost all young men kept asking passengers if everything was fine. Food quality ok nothing special. Selection of movies on the IFE good but have seen better. The worst thing on this A346 was the seat: way too narrow to have some good sleep on this 12.50 hrs trip. Overall Lufthansa is still my number one choice when flying throughout Europe or to US/South America.,Economy Class,3,5,4,3,4,yes,184,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Bite size piece of veal. No easily accessible headphone jack? Seat barely worked - had to wiggle the switches back and forth many different ways to get the seat to recline. A failed experience in every respect. I had a fully flexible C class fare booked on UAL and to get home two hours earlier switched to this flight.

2014-05-17,Lufthansa customer review,1,"Overall a very good product in First Class. Ground service at other airports is not on the same level as Frankfurt or Munich but that's to be expected. Food quality is good but could still be improved. One point I would like to critique is that the drinks menu promises a choice of champagne but usually there is only one of the choices on board. While I was never dissatisfied with the champagne that was offered it annoys me to be offered a choice only to hear that there really is no choice. Another points I would like to make is about the inflight entertainment system. First off I have to say that it has improved tremendously on the content side. Sadly there is still no improvement on the user input side which is very unresponsive and on the design of the ""Lufthansa Media World"" is still confusing and overly complex. Service from the flight attendants was very good but felt a bit scripted and unenthusiastic. The seat is excellent for lounging as well as sleeping and has plenty of adjustment options.

Due to all the security checks and their cost my last trip overall experience is a far cry from how pleasurable traveling used to be thus rating is less than perfect but I need to admit that Lufthansa personnel makes all efforts to make the nuisances as painless as possible.

Again a good overall experience though I have to comment on the ground services upon my arrival in FRA. The flight was delayed and it was almost impossible to get to the next gate on time. I would have expected some kind of assistance by LH ground staff in order to make my connection. Other airlines offer this service even to their business class passengers.

2014-05-19,Lufthansa customer review,9,FRA-BKK with onward flight on Thai Airways to SYD. Excellent service by ground staff and cabin crew. Food was outstanding and I managed to sleep throughout the flight. Return flight connecting from SIN on SQ970. BKK-FRA also in F then FRA-HAM in Business. Again a good overall experience though I have to comment on the ground services upon my arrival in FRA. The flight was delayed and it was almost impossible to get to the next gate on time. I would have expected some kind of assistance by LH ground staff in order to make my connection. Other airlines offer this service even to their business class passengers. This could certainly be improved. Both long haul flights were on a A340 with the old First Class.,First Class,4,4,5,3,4,yes,201,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-05-21,Lufthansa customer review,9,I notice a lot of improvement at Lufthansa as they want to reach 5 star status. Hong Kong - Frankfurt boarding well organized. New Boeing 747-800 good Economy seats and improved inflight entertainment selection. Even a menu card in Economy Class. Food was really good for this service class. First a dinner with Asian or European selection and before landing hot breakfast. They should improve the presentation of the hot dish (tray and extras are fine) and serve warm bread these are always cold and hard. Beverage selection extraordinary. Staff very professional friendly efficient and helped mothers with their kids. I think it's an excellent airline when travelling with a child. There should be more lavatories in Economy class. No amenity kit. Blankets and specially pillows of high quality with real feathers. Plane change to Madrid in Frankfurt: Arrival in the new terminal aera Z hassle free and smooth. Plane to Madrid full. Another hot breakfast was served. Crew very charming and attentive again. No entertainment system - but's that's okay for short flights. Moving map should be introduced. Swiss has it on board even on intra Eruopean routes. In all great experience professional punctual and I felt very safe. But they have to work on the details for the 5 stars: presentation of hot meals hot bread amenity kit better arrival service in Frankfurt for passengers that don't know this giant airport. And entertainment system on short flights.,Economy Class,4,5,4,4,5,yes,205,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-23,Lufthansa customer review,7,Aircraft was clean and up to date. Lufthansa service was good as usual.

2014-05-26,Lufthansa customer review,1,"Flew Business Class - Frankfurt-Shanghai and Shanghai-Munich. This is not Business Class at all. The inclined flat beds are hard and it is not possible to lie on the side due to the curve of the leg rest. The food was at best ""better tourist class"" lukewarm and without any finesse at all. With the exception of a New Zealand white the wines were simply lousy. Very little selection.

2014-05-28,Lufthansa customer review,9,I had the pleasure to travel on new B747-8i from Frankfurt to Washington Dulles and back to Munich on Airbus - both equipped with the new seats. There's a big difference to the old ones! The seat is stylish and completely flat. Inflight movie selection is great now as well as the earphones. What I like most about Lufthansa is their efficient consistent and very friendly service onboard. The food was like a restaurant. Wine selection fine but could be better and wider. Unfortunately they don't offer cappuccino or espresso. Business lounges are a great plus. Staff at US airports should be trained to be friendlier.,Business Class,5,5,5,5,4,yes,213,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-05-29,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH 424 Munich - Boston. The Lufthansa Economy product provides mostly ok standards. Current economy seats are nearly the same (bad) experience as for every airline. Preferred check-in and Lounge due to Airline status do make the pre-flight procedures a good experience. For this particular flight crew were very attentive serving additional drinks throughout the flight. The inflight entertainment system could use a few more recent films. On time landing and overall no issues.,Economy Class,2,5,5,3,4,yes,216,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-29,Lufthansa customer review,6,MUC-EWR economy was a great flight on a 340-600. But the return leg from YUL-FRA was a disappointment. Old 340-300 no USB chargers a terrible screen late departure and arrival without explanation and dinner was served by only 2 teams for the entire economy class one by aisle which means that we in the back (row 42 of 27 or so) got ours an hour after they began. This also meant on a 7 hour flight that there was little time between dinner and breakfast. In flight entertainment is pretty poor - 3 weeks between the flights and they were still showing the same episodes of TV shows. Food was nothing special especially the breakfast was an overly sweet muesli bar a muffin and some fruit. So a mixed bag. The crew was ok though.,Economy Class,4,4,3,1,4,yes,217,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-05-29,Lufthansa customer review,8,Rio to Barcelona via FRA. Had already travelled 17 hours from NZ before taking Lufthansa but crew were warm efficient. Could see I was looking fatigued even on departure and crew got everyone fed and watered soon after 10pm take off. In first row of economy on 744 which meant no one could recline into my face! Seat ok and legroom in first row restricted by bulkhead. IFE didn't work in my row but not fussed as tired (purser handed out 25 euro voucher to use on return to Rio. Appreciated). Teriyaki chicken a strange choice out of Rio (impression coloured by horrible experience of teriyaki chicken on Hawaiian) but tasted better than looked. Campari enjoyed as aperitivo and Baileys as digestivo. Previous LH experiences have been lacklustre but felt the crew were personable and not the usual robots. All in all v satisfied. LH is a reliable airline offering great service and fair prices. Look forward to return flight to Rio this weekend but bound to be full of football fans pre World Cup!,Economy Class,4,5,4,1,5,yes,218,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Good cabin ambience and nice new seating with variable firmness option. Area for feet when fully reclined relatively narrow but seat length good for tall person. Very good service from a professional crew. Good quiet cabin for night flight. Good food and wine. Large screen and good programming. Very fast and efficient connection in Dusseldorf and nice lounge.

2014-05-29,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew VNO-FRA-CPH on 25/5/14 in Economy Class. On the VNO-FRA sector they served a surprisingly good and filling breakfast I hadn't expected anything at all. FRA-CPH sector staff served a pudding and they came around with drinks twice on this 1:15 flight. Staff were very welcoming. Seats could be softer but still there was plenty of legroom. Frankfurt airport itself is very boring but at least Lufthansa provides free coffee/tea and newspapers in the transit area. Will fly LH Again.,Economy Class,3,5,5,2,4,yes,220,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-02,Lufthansa customer review,4,LH458 MUC to SFO A340-600. Business class without the new seats actually a rather inferior product and the new seating needs to be much better. Mediocre food with a veal dish for the first meal that consisted of two bites of dry overcooked meat. The meal before landing consisted of curry wurst and a small salad. Really German food is great but curry wurst as the featured food on a $5000 round-trip ticket? Service was sufficiently warm and efficient. In sum Lufthansa will reliably get you from point to point (as long as the pilots are not on strike) but it's really an inferior product (a recent Delta business class flight from ATL to Madrid was far superior in every way e.g. food comfort service).,Business Class,2,4,2,3,1,no,221,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-02,Lufthansa customer review,8,May 26 2014 LH 431. Good service and food. Nice inflight entertainment with seatback video screens.

Also came with some reasonable space for the legs in Economy (I am 189cm tall) however all the seats in new airplanes today look good but completely lack lumber support. Very good and friendly service! Good food and no additional charges did apply for a glass of wine! Keep that up Lufthansa! Also very clean and friendly looking airplane. And finally many choices for the entertainment program (movies) - very good!

I recently flew from Frankfurt to Los Angeles flight 450 Economy class and on my return flight LH 453 from Los Angeles to Munich I was able to upgrade to Business class by using my Miles and More account. Compared to the Economy class the Business class seats are very comfortable allowing to stretch completely and have a nice rest so that the flight time seems to be much shorter. Also the connecting flights to Verona Italy with Air Dolomiti were perfectly on time. I only wish that the fares to fly in Business class were not so pricy i.e. more affordable then I would book all my travels with Lufthansa in Business class.,Economy Class,2,5,5,5,4,yes,231,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-06-05,Lufthansa customer review,10,I was lucky to receive a complementary upgrade to business Class for my flight FRA-LAX. As usual in Lufthansa Business Class the service was excellent personnel always polite and attentive. The inflight entertainment was of best quality in terms of hardware but fell behind competitors in breadth of offering where eg Singapore even in economy has at least 5 times the amount. Lufthansa's service is more conservative than eg Virgin which suits my personal tastes more. I paid for a flexible economy class ticket for the trip FRA-LAX returning JFK-FRA which was in my view expensive but LH was the only carrier able to offer non-stop on both legs - so LH scores again over competitors in this case on global reach. In the past I have been a regular international flyer with LH having had Senator status for at least 10 yr. However this has lapsed and I have recently been travelling mostly as an economy passenger. Accordingly I cannot accurately compare the current standard of LH business with many other competitors with the exception of Singapore and Emirates who unfortunately offer better seat comfort and entertainment. The aircraft on LH450 was a 747-8 which offered less seat breadth in the reclining position than the A380s of Singapore and Emirates.,Business Class,3,5,3,3,3,yes,233,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Flight was on time and the friendly cabin crew served a tasty sandwich and full bar service. Return flight on E195 was one hour late due to late income of the aircraft. I was always a big fan of the Embraer plane but this time I was very disappointed. The seats are cramped and not at all comfortable. Cabin crew again was very friendly.

The flight was very early in the morning with no delay and very quick check-in at TXL. The service - even if decreased over the years - was including snack and drinks not worth complaining. Good things at LH are the seat comfort being better then with the usual LCC at SXF e.g. and a very good choice of newspapers.

Cabin crew ok but a couple of members were everything but polite. Usual long-haul dinner choice (pasta or chicken) usual breakfast. Arrived in FRA 25 minutes before schedule.

The final part of our journey was an internal flight to Barcelona Venezuela where we had planned to visit family. This part of the journey was without incident the return flight was a nightmare. We were due to leave Caracas on May 2013. We started our journey very early leaving to take internal flights from Barcelona to Caracas. Upon presenting ourselves at check in we were informed that our tickets had been accidentally canceled and that it was an internal error of the airline and would be corrected. Another person was called to the desk from the 1st class check in who said that the flights had been cancelled and that we could not travel as a refund had been issued. No explanation was offered and no one knew on whose authority our tickets had been cancelled.

2014-06-16,Lufthansa customer review,1,My wife and I booked a return ticket leaving Heathrow to Caracas Venezuela via Frankfurt. The final part of our journey was an internal flight to Barcelona Venezuela where we had planned to visit family. This part of the journey was without incident the return flight was a nightmare. We were due to leave Caracas on May 2013. We started our journey very early leaving to take internal flights from Barcelona to Caracas. Upon presenting ourselves at check in we were informed that our tickets had been accidentally canceled and that it was an internal error of the airline and would be corrected. Another person was called to the desk from the 1st class check in who said that the flights had been cancelled and that we could not travel as a refund had been issued. No explanation was offered and no one knew on whose authority our tickets had been cancelled. We were told the only way we could travel that day was to buy another ticket for nearly £3.000 money which we didn't have available at the end of our holiday. The desk attendants refused to help us in any other way.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,249,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-18,Lufthansa customer review,2,I connected to LH at Frankfurt from a United flight originating at SFO. The arrival and departure at FRA both involved aircraft parked on remote pads and being ferried on stuffed buses to the terminal buildings where insufficient gate space apparently exists. As I was about to get stuffed onto a bus an imperious LH gate agent demanded I surrender the bag in which I carry my CPAP machine. She couldn't have cared less that I was told to keep close hold on it on all my travels and other airport staff have no problem treating it as carry-on. Furthermore there was plenty of bin and underseat space on the flight. Other than that nastiness the flight itself was fine and LH probably deserves its 4-star rating excepting for transfers at FRA.,Economy Class,4,1,3,3,2,yes,250,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-18,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH451 on 11 June from LAX to FRA. As usual Lufthansa's service - staff food and entertainment - was excellent though it was a bit tough to get the touch screen to react. The economy seats on the new 747-800 however leave something to be desired. While the legroom is alright the seat is very narrow doesn't recline very much not very comfortable on a 10 hour flight.,Economy Class,2,5,5,4,4,yes,251,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The Inflight Entertainment didn't respond very quick on fingerprints and some of the movies are not particularly new. I saw the same movie-titles on my flight with this airline 8 months ago. They served pasta or chicken for dinner - it's always the same. The bread they served was warm and tasted very well. The little snack for ""breakfast"" didn't knock my socks off. It was better in the past.",Economy Class,5,5,3,3,4,yes,254,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-06-23,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH 451. We sat exit row seats in the brand new 747-8. Lots of space entertainment system finally up to date with hi-res displays good selection etc. However lots and I mean lots of restroom traffic. LH went cheap and only installed 2 restrooms for middle section of eco class to cram in 2 more rows (however more legroom on this new plane). Ridiculous and therefor many people waiting in line in front of and around your seat at all times. I always bring my own food since LH and most airplane food in economy is inedible so can't comment on food.,Economy Class,3,4,1,4,3,yes,255,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

I usually fly Lufthansa since the local airport near the city I work in is fairly connected with one of its hubs. Even if the flight tickets are a bit expensive I think they provide a reliable service and have a good customer service. Last flight was on the same line an intercontinental one and even travelling economy class you're quite comfortable aboard. I wish the other airlines I use when star alliance partners are not available would provide a similar service.,Economy Class,4,4,3,4,4,yes,257,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Passenger handling at the airport was superb pick-up from aircraft escort to lounge passport formalities all done while we relax. The First Cabin was fully booked and we had two stewards taking care plus the cabin chief checking in occasionally. Aside from the splendid service like in a gourmet restaurant our crew was very cordial and made sure our time was as enjoyable as possible. The only downside I can remember is that the air-conditioning was quite draughty and could not be reduced.,First Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,264,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-01,Lufthansa customer review,8,Lufthansa has an excellent first class product. The seat and bed comfort is excellent. Caviar is still served but the portions tend to get smaller than before. The wine selection is always interesting. Food is good but the offer in the first class lounge in LAX not up to European first class standard. In the on board entertainment you might not find the latest films but it's a good cross selection. The atmosphere and color scheme of the newly designed cabin is very pleasant. Bathrooms are bigger on the 380 than on the 747. The content of the amenity bag is rather disappointing. Selection of reading material is good although I would prefer some travel or culinary magazines. The friendly staff will generally address you by name.,First Class,5,4,4,4,4,yes,265,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-07-03,Lufthansa customer review,9,Vancouver-Munich-Geneva (4 June 2014) and return (16 June 2014). Flights on time; luggage delivered promptly; cheerful and hard-working FAs throughout making several juice and water runs on the long-haul flights. YVR-MUC and return: A330-300 with 2+4+2 seat layout. Two proper meals served the usual chicken or stuffed pasta as the mains (and for overnight flight YVR-MUC an omelette as the second meal). The main problem with A330 and A340 aircraft generally is poor seat design in economy. Window seats leave a 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage wasting space and very uncomfortable for anyone trying to lean against the fuselage to sleep. The two outboard seats (window plus aisle) are supported by two central stanchions that rob passengers of foot space. No standard carry-on bag will fit under the seats in front and more foot space is taken up by entertainment boxes. YVR-MUC flight had these problems. However MUC-YVR return flight had a new A330 interior with far better seat design: it still left the 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage but the two supporting stanchions were at the very ends of the pair of seats leaving proper foot space and enough room that two full-sized carry-on bags could be placed under the seats in front if desired. AVOD offered a vast array of films music and television programs (even binge-watching programs like the complete first season of the US House of Cards). MUC-GVA and return: E195 with 2+2 layout with seats more comfortable than on an A330. Even a sandwiches-and-drinks service for these one-hour flights. Trip rating would be 8 for the old A330 seating 10 for the new A330 seating.,Economy Class,4,5,5,5,5,yes,267,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-06,Lufthansa customer review,9,MUC-CGN return (twice). I am always happy when I can book Lufthansa (work related) because it is such a reliable and punctual airline. The check-in and boarding is very easy the planes are always clean a little snack and two drinks are provided and I can choose my favourite newspaper. Usually the crew greets with a smile and has a service-orientated attitude. The seats are a bit hard but for one-hour domestic flights this is no problem.,Economy Class,4,5,5,N/A,4,yes,268,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-06,Lufthansa customer review,1,"27 June 2014 flight LH454. I flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to San Francisco on an A380 and it is not an experience I would like to repeat. I know flying economy is supposed to be uncomfortable and unpleasant on any airline but adding hundreds of passengers to what most other airplanes carry only compounds the misery. Space tight seats very narrow and food bland as usual for economy. What made this flight ""memorable"" were the long boarding lines and the length of time it took to get off the airplane after an 11 hour flight. I hope the A340 and the A330 airplanes stick around for a long time to come.",Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,269,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-07-06,Lufthansa customer review,9,I travelled with LH1402 from Frankfurt (Germany) to Prague (Czech Republic) on June 23 scheduled 21.55-22.55. Due to late change of aircraft from the planned Airbus A321 to an Airbus A320 Winglets the flight was slightly delayed but the flight managed to depart before the awful night ban at Frankfurt Airport. The aircraft was only one week old according to the crew. That was obvious everything was extremely tidy and clean. However no IFE and still the same type of Recaro seats with any support for your head which I find very uncomfortable below industry standards. I was seated in Business Class on seat 4F and the service were excellent. Even on this very short flight a very tasteful salad was served and before the meal drinks were served. Right the way it should be drinks before the meal. An excellent flight and a very good experience and the cabin staff even addressed you by your name when serving excellent.,Business Class,3,5,5,3,4,yes,271,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-06,Lufthansa customer review,8,I travelled with Lufthansa from Stockholm Arlanda Sweden to Frankfurt Germany on June 23. The aircraft on this service was an Airbus A321. I travelled in Business Class and was seated on 4A. The overall experience is very good and everything is well thought through with German precision. The cabin was very clean and tidy and the service was very good. The food served on this route was a cold dish but very tasteful. If to complain about something the service was not especially well co-ordinated. The meal was served first and it took approximately 10 minutes before any drinks were served. I would have expected the opposite in Business Class. Lufthansa does not offer any IFE on intra-European flights but offers very good inflight magazines. The main negative thing to my opinion is the very uncomfortable seats. Recaro slim fit with very limited comfort. There is no head rest available so bring your cushion or maybe two and the seats are very hard. The seat pitch is however according to industry standards. On this occasion I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt with 1 hour transfer time. The flight was approximately 25 minutes late into Frankfurt but there were no problems with my transfer.,Business Class,2,4,4,3,4,yes,272,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-13,Lufthansa customer review,9,"June 10 2014 LH 493 to Frankfurt. July 3 2014 LH 476 to Vancouver. We paid extra for exit row seats and were not disappointed lots of legroom. Only critique was that people tend to congregate around area for bathrooms which isn't a big deal but when they hang out there for more than half an hour and keep bumping into you while you're trying to sleep then it's annoying. Outgoing flight was 747 and seemed to attract more ""standers"" return flight was 330 and shape of cabin did not encourage people to hang around as much. Pleasantly surprised at number of meals and snacks during both flights lots of variety service was great and flight attendants went out of way to accommodate other passengers with young children. Look forward to flying Lufthansa again hopefully in Premium or Business Class next time.",Economy Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,273,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-13,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH 457 3rd July. Overall very good. The available leg space was however below all criticism. For some reason the A-C seats on row 44 on the 747-800 had about 1 decimeter less leg space than the other seats on the same row (and the rest of the plane). I have never been so cramped on an Intercontinental flight before (or any flight for that matter).,Economy Class,1,4,3,4,5,yes,274,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-07-15,Lufthansa customer review,2,Flight from Perth to Frankfurt via Singapore. Pleasantly surprised that the Lufthansa A380 flight was more pleasant (happy crew) and comfortable than the code-share Singapore airline flight Perth to Singapore. However the return flight from Toulouse to Perth turned into a nightmare due to thunderstorm causing delays into Frankfurt. The almost total lack of customer care while stranded over night at Frankfurt and a 7 hour wait to re- book (almost 5 hours of which was in a line on foot) was a disgrace. It is the fear of this recurring which means I will be highly unlikely to fly with Lufthansa again.,Economy Class,2,1,3,3,2,no,275,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-07-17,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH 1793. Overall a nice flight on time and efficient boarding and leaving the plane. Might be a surly morning but one of the attendants had an unnecessarily rude attitude. Just because I was slow to stand up (and crouch under the low ceiling) to leave the plane he asked me if I was ever going to leave and that other passengers wanted to get out as well. Never has this been a problem on any other airline. He also gave surly remarks to other passengers who didn't perform well enough.

As usual I was very pleased to fly with Lufthansa. Unlike other times the seat comfort was not so nice I was not able to sleep. Could be either a matter of coincidence or the version of the seats on that plane.

Good Service as usual especially regarding drinks. The only problem are the snacks they offered. On the first sector a plastic cup of fresh fruit salad and yoghurt tasty but not at all filling. Much worse on the flight back: a slice of disgusting lukewarm pizza of low quality in a bland cardboard box without logo a really bad presentation.

Fortunately the check-in staff managed to sort me out a replacement. The airbus was not too bad the crew were very helpful. The inflight meal was absolutely dreadful. Neither I nor the crew could determine what form of protein it was. The horrible food and the airline giving my seat away soured what would have been a reasonable flight.

2014-07-27,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH 418 6 July 2014. Overall pleasant flight on the 747-8. Anybody with any financial means should avoid economy. The problem is not with the airline but the travel companions. The only real drawback are the seats which are too narrow in economy to sit in without severe back pain. I avoided the bathrooms. Luckily the flight was only 8.5 hours. What surprised me a bit was the shape of some of the interior knowing that the 747-8 is only around for a short while (carpeting wall sidings). As usual the staff is really top notch and worlds apart from US carriers and - sad to say - AF / KLM or BA.

Fortunately only a short haul flight. One out of three bathrooms not fully operational on a fully booked flight. The purser confirmed that she was aware of the bathroom situation and that she had already two prior flights on the same aircraft that day. During beverage service same purser opened a bottle of sparkling wine mid cabin and showered three rows of guests plus the interior.

No queuing necessary so the transfer time of around 2 hours was almost too long since security checks were not crowded. The flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes early. The service was excellent the cabin very modern (new 747-8) and the inflight entertainment offered a lot of variety of current movies and TV shows. Another benefit is that the train ride from Cologne to Frankfurt is rewarded with Miles too.

Friendly staff. All are short-haul so no entertainment. There were one or two flights with proper meals but the others only had snacks and drink. The food was all right as they are very short.

2014-08-03,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew Business Class round-trip LAX -Stockholm Stockholm-SFO. I flew the 747-800 and was really impressed with the new Business. I sat downstairs and had a seat in the middle section where every seat is an aisle. Spacious and comfortable. All flight attendants are gracious - would not say so much that the food was any better than UAL. In fact their little mousse dessert was nothing compared to UAL's Ice Cream sundaes. On Lufthansa they gave us a small tin for the amenity kit. The toilets are well stocked with amenities. Inflight entertainment on the new 747-800 was exceptional. So many choices. The return flight from Munich was delayed due to a broken aircraft. We left about 2.5 hours late from MUC. They offered everyone food vouchers and handled the delay very well. While the old Business Class seating on this A340-600 is not at all as nice as the New BC - it was ok. The crew were exceptionally friendly and very careful to make sure that everyone was taken care of.,Business Class,4,5,4,4,3,yes,297,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Lots of legroom flat bed to rest wonderful service and good food. If I could change anything: better trays (for food) - this is the only element that I don't think is very comfortable but this isn't a reason to score lower.

2014-08-11,Lufthansa customer review,5,Staff on Lufthansa are normally very friendly and professional. Nothing to criticize. The seats in economy are a bit narrow - especially if the guest in front of you reclines the seat. The new onboard entertainment system on flight 477 from Vancouver to Munich is nice - as you have your own high quality touch screen with a standard 3.5 in plug for earphones. So your own (noise cancelling) headphones will work. You also get a USB charger on that. In my case the entertainment system did not contain any movies (probably introduced during service before the flight) and i was not able to watch any for the 11 hr flight.,Economy Class,3,5,3,1,3,yes,303,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-08-11,Lufthansa customer review,1,Flew from Munich to Toronto August 7th (over 8 hours) and the audio on our seats (3 middle seats in the very last row of the plane) did not work the entire flight. The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice. It was an extremely uncomfortable and frustrating flight. We had paid the same amount as all the other folks who had working electronics.,Economy Class,1,3,2,1,1,no,305,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

These were paid for months ago so you now those seats are sold and therefore cannot understand how you can overbook.

2014-08-15,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew London Heathrow (LHR) to Larnaca (LCA) via Munich (MUC) on 22/07/2014 in economy. Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person. Happy to recommend Lufthansa though their check-in arrangements at LHR need serious review. The staff service rating applies to aircraft staff. Their LHR ground handling agent's staff would score a zero.,Economy Class,1,5,4,1,5,yes,310,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-08-18,Lufthansa customer review,5,LH 414 7 Aug 2014 MUC-IAD. I have 3 complaints about the flight with my wife last Thursday: 1) With the online check-in I could not get a boarding pass. There was a message that a failure occurred but not which kind of failure and how to correct it. 2) There were two check-in lines at the airport. After 30 mins queuing Lufthansa personnel asked me for the boarding pass before I could continue in the line. As I could not get a boarding pass online or with the machine I could not go to the check-in counter. I had to queue in a second line. 3) At the other counter the seat reservation which we made 3 weeks before was cancelled.

I flew with my wife who has Senator status with Lufthansa and I could experience how warmly she was welcomed by the crew. Unfortunately this led them to neglecting me to an extend that I had to be after them to get something else to drink that what my wife had asked for. Somehow many of the Lufthansa crews on long distance flights still miss the opportunities to show some kind of friendliness and one still has the feeling that one is sitting in a bus from A to B.

2014-08-26,Lufthansa customer review,3,LH411 from JFK to Munich 18th August 2014. I sat in Economy class together with my kids. The comfort was more or less unsatisfactory because of the space between the rows the passengers around us and the service. Staff were not very friendly and motivating all additional drinks had to be requested by ourselves and their presence in the cabin was very low. Seemed that they were more interested in talking than working. I am frequent traveler and spend thousands of Euros on LH tickets every year and have experienced the following: the prices have increased and the service and quality decreased.

2014-08-28,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew the brand new 747-800 on this Washington D.C. to Frankfurt route. Was my first time and was very curious about it. The upper deck business class is very quiet and has a private feel to it. I also like that you have a private storage compartment right below the window like on the upper deck of an A380. Lufthansa has made some innovative design choices. For example in the bathrooms the toilet seat and cover both have a separate handle so that it's easy to lift either up. Such a simple invention yet I've never seen it on other airlines. The new biz class seat is a huge improvement over the old angled-flat seat which is still used on all their other planes. It's a friendly configuration for if you're traveling with a friend the seats are slightly angled towards each other making it easy to converse. In sleep mode the seat is unfortunately not too comfortable especially since the footrest where your feet go is very narrow. The food and service was ok. They had a good selection of wines and the menu had a regional focus focusing on cuisine from the area you're flying from. Love the idea however taste wise it was not outstanding. Overall though a huge improvement from their old business class. I hope they upgrade the rest of their long-haul fleet with these seats.,Business Class,4,3,3,4,4,yes,323,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-09-06,Lufthansa customer review,9,PRG-FRA-SIN-FRA-HAM both trips with late evening departures. Compared to other airlines on the route Lufthansa is downright boring but absolutely efficient. The short-haul A320s have zero IFE and only a bare minimum in terms of onboard comfort but the handling and service is flawless. My 19.30 flight from PRG was delayed which would have prevented me from making a tight connection in FRA. Instead baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight which was delayed as well and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380 which is always a treat. The cabin is extremely basic and the AVoD is just average but the service is snappy and organized meals are good crews are friendly.

When I went to Lufthansa desk at the Frankfurt airport the ladies there were more than accommodating trying to offer me as many options as possible to get me to my destination. I opted for the next day flight to Calgary via Vancouver. The stay at the Interhotel at the Lufthansa expense was very pleasant great food and room made me forget about a snag in my return trip.

2014-09-14,Lufthansa customer review,1,"There are very few flights between London and Hanover so thinking Lufthansa was an organized airline my firm booked me a flight via Frankfurt. It's a mediocre flight from London to Frankfurt however the flight parked at the gate they did not use the finger instead passengers were all expected to get out at the rear of the aircraft and take a bus ride to another part of the airport (this seems to happen a lot with Lufthansa flights from London to Berlin and Dusseldorf too). After an involuntary tour of the airport I battled my way through security customs and immigration to get to the Hanover gate only to find the plane had gone. To my way of thinking this represents ""mis-selling"" as there is no way anyone is ever going to make the advertised connection in 30 minutes (not at Frankfurt anyway). Perhaps Lufthansa regard English passengers as ""under-people"". To add salt to my wounds Lufthansa made no apologies and just bumped me onto the next flight four hours later. I complained again at Frankfurt customer service which was a log wait amongst the flotsam and jetsam but was only offered a €10 coffee voucher which I declined as an insult. I can only assume that Lufthansa is now competing with German Wings for the most miserable service.

Unfortunately no non-alcoholic beer on-board.,Economy Class,4,4,3,3,4,yes,340,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-09-19,Lufthansa customer review,3,I am traveling frequently with Lufthansa and am usually quite satisfied. On the positive side of LH415 I would like to mention that they managed to transfer my luggage although United co-chair LH9295 was extremely late. The seats on LH415 can however only be rated as less than adequate. LH does not yet offer any form of economy plus. The seat are both rather narrow (8 lines of seats in an A330!) and the spacing between them is completely insufficient for tall people. I will not fly this airplane in this configuration anymore. The provision of classical music is mostly absent.,Economy Class,1,4,3,1,3,yes,341,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-09-19,Lufthansa customer review,1,LH 426 FRA to Philadelphia Tues 16th 1pm but changed to LH432 to Chicago at 5.10pm 16th. American connecting flight number to Philadelphia (arriving 1.15am today). Flight from Frankfurt to Philadelphia cancelled and rebooked on a later flight arriving almost half a day later. These things happen but the systematic rudeness and lack of consideration of the staff made matters worse. I've often found Lufthansa staff are among the most lacking in consideration of any airline.,Economy Class,2,1,1,3,3,no,343,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-09-19,Lufthansa customer review,5,LH 475 Sept 14 2014 YUL to MUC. Great staff service that ensured my wife and I plus luggage were on this flight in spite of a non-through ticket and just 50 minutes of transit time. The flight itself was much less pleasant - cramped seats not enough foot room in front of seat and an entertainment system that leaves much to be desired.,Economy Class,2,4,3,2,4,yes,344,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-09-22,Lufthansa customer review,9,"Brand new airbus A330 from Munich to Vancouver. New inflight entertainment with rich variety of movies and music. However the sound volume was far too low for enjoying the acoustics. Seats in Economy improved. Best of all however: very clean washrooms during the entire 10.5 hr flight. Flight attendants went in with gloves quite frequently.

2014-09-22,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH721 PEK-FRA Airbus A380. Advance online seat reservation was not working but able to get an aisle during online checkin - which opened earlier than the advertised 23 hours before the flight so most good seats were gone. Seats are very cramped - 31 inch pitch is too small for a long-limbed 6 footer like me. Entertainment system was awful - screen far too close painfully slow the films were old and music content limited audio barely audible. On the plus side staff were excellent.,Economy Class,3,4,4,2,4,no,348,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-09-24,Lufthansa customer review,7,"I flew from Frankfurt to Newark NJ on the last leg of a 4-leg trip to Turkey and flew in Business Class on a 747. My seat was dirty with crumbs in the glasses holder wasn't able to use my own headphones for in-flight entertainment and the movies system was slow unresponsive and had few movie choices. I watched a DVD that I brought rather than dealing with these issues. The food was ok but unimpressive although the croissants were fresh and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed the red wine and was constantly refilled as well as coffee when I switched and the seat was comfortable once I was able to manipulate my 6'1"" frame into a comfortable position.

2014-09-28,Lufthansa customer review,8,Our return flights MAN-Munich LH2503/2 Aug 26 and Sep 23. Consistently reliable friendly and courteous staff. Cabin in reasonable condition. Very happy to fly Lufthansa on this route. We also flew return MUC-YVR LH476/7 on the same dates. Outbound 26 August. Inbound 23 September. The business class seats were fine we were in rows 4 and 11. For me row 4 was far more private. Seats fine but not as good as Qatar's 777 flights. Comfortable reclining and flat for overnight. Slept reasonably well. I'd do this again at the right price. Food fine with reasonable variety. Staff efficient without being engaging whereas staff on the Manchester leg were more friendly and charming on both flights than the long haul crew. Overall happy with experience but do think the long haul staff should be more engaging.,Business Class,3,4,4,3,5,yes,350,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Big confusion at the airport being sent from station to station 4 times before we finally got to ticket agent than we waited 4 hours to get new flight out of Germany for next morning! Frankfurt to Dusseldorf to Chicago and again delay of 40 minutes and almost missed Chicago flight again thank goodness the airport is small as we got on the plane at the last minute. Airbus is definitely more comfortable than the Boeing 747 - not enough leg room even for someone 5 ft 5 seats too narrow - misery for 9 hours.

That's a pity because once again LH showed why it's a great airline. Friendly staff -ground and air - and a very punctual performance on both legs. Tasty sandwich two drinks and reasonable comfort on the A320. A little more expensive than the LCC's but it's worth it. LH stays my favourite airline.

2014-10-01,Lufthansa customer review,3,LH 464. The plane was changed between flight booking and the flight itself therefore all passengers (especially families) could not sit together as originally planned. Everything was mixed up.

Nevertheless I would book Lufthansa again.,Economy Class,3,1,2,4,3,yes,353,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-10-01,Lufthansa customer review,10,LH 465 9/21/2014. Lufthansa provided excellent value a very pleasant flight experience and great professional staff from pilots to cabin crew! It is always a pleasure to fly with Lufthansa because their crew really values you and gives you the best flight experience possible. The cabin crew were very responsive. The seats were comfortable. There is none of the nickel-and-diming miserliness other airlines seem to specialize in. The service is prompt courteous and generous!,Economy Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,355,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-05,Lufthansa customer review,7,TXL-FRA-RIX: Both the legs were operated by A321. Crew were pleasant on both the flights especially that onwards to RIX. They were lively willing to help and didn't mind making small talk with passengers. Like all LH flights even this one was refitted with Recaro seats and ceiling attached TV. Passengers were served muesli bars on first leg and on the second leg yoghurt dip with freshly chopped fruits - this is what disappoints me as LH takes pride in being full service airline. Previously they at least served freshly baked bread rolls and sandwiches. LH should really reconsider on snacks they serve as I believe 120 mins are enough to serve a proper small meal although the crew is saving grace and made several drink rounds. I have travelled extensively on different airlines and wouldn't hesitate to suggest LH to up their game.,Economy Class,3,4,2,2,3,yes,356,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-08,Lufthansa customer review,4,Entertainment System and reading lamp didn't work and this is not the first time.

2014-10-08,Lufthansa customer review,4,Lufthansa flight LH763 from Delhi to Munich October 4th 2014. Out-dated and worn business class seats. Possible to recline fully but narrow. Really close to non-existent service. Despite few passengers in business class very slow and inattentive service. After initial take-off beverages no more drink service of water or anything else. Food quality like in a cheap charter flight. No one of the staff bothered to serve a quick breakfast to those passengers who wanted to sleep a bit longer not even a cup of coffee.,Business Class,2,1,1,2,2,no,358,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-08,Lufthansa customer review,1,Flight 427 PHL to Frankfurt on August 23 2014. This flight was supposed to have new business class. The video was non-functional and my seat would not operate properly. We were in 4A and 4C. At the end of the flight the flight attendant found a large water bottle in the mechanism inside the seat cushion. Headphones were loose attached to the console and not in separated plastic bags. Drinks were horrible. The flight attendants were nice. The stewardess told us at the end of the flight that planes were switched in Frankfurt.Our flight from Frankfurt to Athens was on a 321 airbus.

2014-10-12,Lufthansa customer review,8,BHX to Munich via Frankfurt and Munich to Birmingham inbound. Could not fault the flights I had with them. Service was very good and cabin crew attentive. Travelled with two friends for the Oktoberfest who were both 6ft 6in and I am below 6 ft. Both of my tall friends had no complaints with the legroom. Baggage arrived on time. All in all flights had been hassle-free. Only downside is lack of entertainment but for a short flight it was barely noticeable.

Truly First Class experience all the way from the exclusive feel of the FCT at Frankfurt limo to the plane and then a very warm and professional welcome from the fantastic crew. Cabin 7/8 full. Seats 1A and 1K are great for people traveling together although not the most private. Beautifully elegant cabin comfortable seat/bed and simply wonderful service. Only the food was disappointing - nothing special and poorly presented. Excellent wines. Bags first off at JFK and off the plane and through Customs within 20 minutes!

2014-10-12,Lufthansa customer review,1,My wife flew on 10/6/2014 from Newark NJ on Flight LH 403 to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Chennai India on Lufthansa LH758. For health reasons my wife needs a wheelchair as she has trouble walking. We requested a wheelchair for her at the Newark Frankfurt and Chennai airports. Everything was fine in Newark NJ. However when she arrived at Frankfurt no wheelchair was provided. Lufthansa staff advised her there was no wheelchair and to walk slowly. When my wife told them she can hardly walk and carry the carry-on luggage they ignored her. Finally one Lufthansa staff walked her to the bus to the next flights terminal but she did not help in any way. Seeing my wife’s inability to move the carry-on another kind passenger helped her. When she arrived at her terminal she had to wait for the cart to drive her to her gate. Lufthansa staff needs to be trained in customer service especially service to individuals who need assistance. These flights are not inexpensive and there is no excuse for this type of rude and incompetent service.,Economy Class,3,1,3,3,3,no,364,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-10-12,Lufthansa customer review,9,Flight LH 409 Newark to Dusseldorf in September. Flight was operated by an older A340-300 which was in very good condition and had nice inflight entertainment on big personal screens (much better than on Lufthansa's A330s at the moment). IFE featured loads of movies and fancy stuff such as real time speed / altitude. Flight departed about 1 hour late. Nevertheless I could easily catch my connection to Vienna. Food was alright could have been a little more though. Drinks were always available. Cabin crew did a great job very friendly and professional. Seat comfort was good for Economy Class enough legroom and I like the 2-4-2 seating. Changing in Dusseldorf was very convenient (small distances and a nice airport). I'm usually very satisfied with Lufthansa.,Economy Class,3,5,4,5,4,yes,366,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-20,Lufthansa customer review,2,Just off LH2051 TXL-MUC. Probably ranks as one of the worst flights ever - no welcome onboard plane totally full however no help from crew in stowing luggage - busy chatting among themselves. Pilot eventually told us they would delay the flight if we did not manage to stow baggage ourselves. Rude and snotty service inflight with no smiles. Seats uncomfortable and too short. In addition to that all flight delayed as usual. LH is going downhill.,Economy Class,1,1,2,1,2,no,367,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-22,Lufthansa customer review,2,Manchester-Chisinau via Munich. Initial outward flight delayed due to crew 'being stuck in traffic' although all passengers were waiting at the gate on time (it was a full flight). Standard of slimline seating on Lufthansa flights not comfortable at all (way too hard even for relatively short flights). Cabin crew pleasant and drinks / snacks ok. On return journey Lufthansa had another delayed flight back to Manchester with plenty of seats still available that would have got me home much earlier than my booked flight but their 'customer service' staff in Munich wouldn't entertain allowing me on it that would be far too helpful for them. All in all nothing special for the price far too inflexible / not focussed on customers and I'll avoid Lufthansa in future for that reason.,Economy Class,2,3,3,1,2,no,368,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-22,Lufthansa customer review,5,I recently flew on Luthansa Flight LH414 (Munich to Washington D.C.). Plane was good but the service was marginal. Flight service was very rushed. One got the impression that they wanted to get everything done quickly so that they could sit in the back and talk which this is what they did. I sat in the last row of the plane.,Economy Class,4,1,1,4,3,yes,369,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-22,Lufthansa customer review,9,Flew with a A330 from Munich to NYC (JFK airport). It was a pleasant trip. Comfortable seats nice and very helpful flight attendants. Unlike e.g. British Airways which I have used for my last two trips to North America the catering on board was great. Additional water or juice e.g. was served regularly. The snack before landing consisted of Weißwurst Pralinen and a Laugenbrötchen which was very delicious. I asked for an extra portion which I got without any hesitation. They would have thrown away any leftover food anyway so I thought eating another portion would be better as it was extremely good. The only downside to the flight was that the aircraft engines are quite loud compared to other aircraft's. Also the choice of films could have been better. Overall I was very satisfied.,Economy Class,5,5,5,3,5,yes,370,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-22,Lufthansa customer review,9,LH494 MUC-YYZ. Airbus A330-300 (333) V1 (re-vamped interior with the new LH biz class seats) seated in eco emergency row 30 window seat pair. Status customer with LH (senator) travelling with partner. Ground service (baggage drop-off lounge etc.) seamless as always. Sky service attentive quick quiet very professional little kids of other passengers and elderly passengers all taken care of with help. Sky catering as good as you can expect in eco little treats added to the overall good level. New version of LH safety script at taxiing is much improved easy-to-understand delivered at the right slow pace w/o becoming dragging and boring. Also no bothering bold music during take-off/landing times as with some other *A carriers. Overall LH manifests that they are of course not the cheapest but they quietly excel in numerous details by those few percent compared to others. You just feel that little bit less worn after an LH eco long-haul as you might do after one with other carriers.,Economy Class,5,5,4,4,4,yes,371,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

They served a cold breakfast which was very good. The way back to FRA was more or less OK. Was not that friendly. What annoyed me was that there were 3 flight attendants as ""Business Class Passengers"" seated. Not my thing at all that staff flies business class and chit chat all the way loudly. Sorry folks of LH but keep things a bit down especially when you have paying business class passengers on flights. Seat them either in the back close to the galley or on a jump seat when the flight is full. I recommend this airline because the way to BRE they did go the extra mile.",Business Class,3,3,4,1,3,yes,377,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-10-31,Lufthansa customer review,8,I am a Lufthansa frequent customer and I have always enjoyed their service and timetable. My flight experience from YUL to MUC left me with a bit of mixed feelings. Even though the flight is not that long approx. 7 hrs the plane was fully packed with people and the seats were really uncomfortable. It was not possible to move around and not even sleep. Furthermore the passenger in front of me considered her right to keep her seat not in the fully upright position during the entire flight leaving me with very limited space. And when I asked the flight attendants to tell her to bring her seat a bit further up so as to have some space myself I was taken by surprise to hear that they could not wake her up and that I should simply do the same or change seat (I seat that I had pre-selected and paid). Maybe Lufthansa needs to reconsider the number of passengers and luggage allowed for long- haul flights and not treat passengers as commodities to that respect.,Economy Class,1,5,4,5,5,yes,378,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-11-03,Lufthansa customer review,6,IAD (Washington Dulles) to MUC (Munich Germany) LH 415 Oct 5 2014. Seat comfort: The aircraft was an A330-300. I had a window seat. Foot space was ridiculously small as two metal boxes of about 10 cm width each were fixed to the legs of the seat in front of me. Every window seat seemed to have that feature. This makes a long haul flight very uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment: The touch screen took ages to react or was so sensitive or insensitive that I never knew whether I had pressed it correctly or not. The rest was fine.,Economy Class,1,4,3,2,3,yes,381,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-11-03,Lufthansa customer review,2,Flight out of Krakow to Munich cancelled due to heavy fog. Lufthansa in Krakow put us up in hotel for night with vouchers for meals. Lufthansa staff at Krakow were great cannot say the same for the staff in Germany! Re-booked next day to Munich one hour layover then home to Chicago. Flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. Thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller. Announcements on plane about other connections but none regarding Chicago. I asked a flight attendant before we landed and she said she knew nothing. We arrived late in Munich So the 2 of us and 3 other passengers missed our connecting flight to Chicago by minutes! No one at gate in Munich to assist us. Finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be re-booked. Re-booked to Frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to Chicago the next day. When we boarded short flight to Frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting! In Munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in Frankfurt. Arriving in Frankfurt we had to go to Service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. He directed us to belt 16 Baggage claim B to get our luggage. We got there no luggage! Talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at A and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. She finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. Frankfurt airport is huge and Lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. Classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The clincher is when we boarded our flight to Chicago the next day we were delayed because a family was detained in immigration! What happened to not being able to hold the plane? Horrible service. Unless Lufthansa is the only airline flying to where I am traveling I am not using them again. No one seemed to know and much less care.,Economy Class,2,1,2,3,4,no,382,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-11-06,Lufthansa customer review,9,Very happy with our first class flights. The first class lounge in Munich was very pleasant with the usual high quality food offerings. The food onboard was good when traveling from Boston to Munich on 10/17 and outstanding on the way back - Munich to Boston on 10/26. Service also very good Boston-Munich and absolutely outstanding on the Munich-Boston flight. The flight attendant on the Munich-Boston flight was fast efficient and very pleasant. Entertainment was OK we both care more for recent movies than the latest releases but I understand it's difficult to please everyone. I'd say that the Wi-Fi should be free in first class. The Munich-Prague and Prague-Munich segments in business class were pretty much standard the Munich-Prague flight was quite delayed fortunately for us the Prague-Munich flight was on time. All in all a pleasant experience.,First Class,4,5,5,4,3,yes,384,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-11-11,Lufthansa customer review,8,LHR-FRA-JNB in economy. Short flight from London to Frankfurt satisfactory with good snack and drink pleasant attendants. Transfer at Frankfurt seamless to the A380 to Johannesburg - gone are the days of long walks through the lengthy corridors of Frankfurt. Very comfortable seats and service on A380. Cabin crew very responsive and friendly. Food satisfactory. Return was CPT-MUC-LHR. A340-600 from Cape Town - plane not crowded so good service again with satisfactory food and drinks. Attendants served beverages throughout the night. Seats were comfortable all round. Minimal fuss and no problems with delays - all flights on time. Very good long haul flight. Short hop from Munich to London was good as well with breakfast snack served just right for this length.

2014-11-11,Lufthansa customer review,9,I traveled with my family on LH 768 from FRA to PNQ on 7th November 2014. It was a really good travel experience for us. Very comfortable and convenient too. Seats are comfortable same as any other regular Lufthansa flights. Landing at Pune for Puneites is far better than to Mumbai saving a lot of time in immigration process and travelling from Mumbai to Pune. Its really great to fly direct to Pune from Europe and credit to Lufthansa and PrivatAir.,Economy Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,387,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-11-12,Lufthansa customer review,1,Oct 19 LH783 a group of us travelled to France in transit at Frankfurt Airport. Our confirmed seatings were all messed up despite we have booked this in Feb 14. It took us 40 minutes at KLIA Lufthansa counter to sort this out - each couple were seated together but the group had to split up. On our return leg (7 Nov 14) our group confirmed seats were again messed up despite reconfirming the seat 3 days before our departure with Lufthansa Malaysia. The check in counter staff was not helpful nor friendly at CDG airport to help us to reassign our seats so that each couple could sit together but the group was split up again. The return flight (Paris to Frankfurt LH1043) was re-timed later by 20 minutes but we were not informed and the flight arrived late at Frankfurt. So we had to run for our connecting flight to KL. There were no Lufthansa Staff at the gate to provide assistance.,Economy Class,3,2,1,3,2,no,390,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Again we were transported by a bus to the B737. Here is where the entire staff and crew showed their effectiveness. The flight duration was cut short to 40 min from the original 55 min.

FRA-BLR and on the return leg BLR-FRA. The seats on the new B-748 were comfortable however my personal reading light did not function and I could not get the wifi access. There was enough space and more than enough to eat on board. The return leg was on an old B-744.

2014-11-20,Lufthansa customer review,8,Flew MAN-MUC-DEL return in Business Class. Lounge in MAN is ok - typical regional airport lounge. Warm croissants. Breakfast on flight was ok - had ordered Asian veg. Service good. The long haul was a pleasant surprise. I'm 6ft tall and managed to get zero sleep on a flight to Mumbai from Frankfurt 7 years ago and that was my last flight with LH. The new Business class was a pleasant surprise. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Amenity kit is good. The seats are a huge improvement on the sloping beds. I managed to get a few hours sleep too. If you sit by the window you may find it a bit cramped. I switched to an aisle on the way back and this wasn't so cramped. Will use them again for Delhi especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food I forgive them. Will fly LH again for value and comfort.,Business Class,4,5,3,4,5,yes,395,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-11-20,Lufthansa customer review,2,"As LH Senator I have repeatedly booked a seat for my flights and repeatedly the seat reservation was cancelled. The seat booking system is not working at all. Estimate 75% of cases the seat cancellation is performed without any background - it is very disappointing. Flight LH2023 is a classical example of another incomprehensible situation - nearly every day the ""business class"" (which in LH's case is nothing but economy divided by curtain from the rest of the plane) is extended till row 12 making 48 business seats while occupation is 3 - 5 ""business"" passengers. Remaining travellers are squeezed in the back while front section is entirely empty. Another trick is to extend the ""business class"" for 24 hours to row 19 remove all forward seats reservations and then return back to the original configuration. Why they do it is a mystery to me. LH obviously don't like their status customers in the front of the aircraft.",Economy Class,2,3,3,N/A,1,no,398,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-11-25,Lufthansa customer review,5,Flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt on AB A380 aircraft clean food OK staff OK. Seat lousy - no legroom and uncomfortable. Armrest on aisle seat would not lower making it hard to leave the seat. Staff didn't know how to fix the problem. In-flight entertainment system next to useless because of unresponsive touch screen and one audio channel not working. Aircraft temperature cold to the point of requiring a jacket be worn at all times. On connecting flight to Berlin Luft. gate staff did not announce gate change in English so confusion resulted among waiting passengers who didn't speak German or missed the change on the electronic screen. Flight from Munich to San Francisco on AB A340 departed late because of baggage handling problem. Aircraft clean but temperature again cold and seat comfort worse than A380. In flight entertainment center barely working because of slow finicky touch screen and static in audio. Food OK not good just OK.

Seat comfort and space are excellent. Inflight movie selection was a bit uninteresting. One slight problem I paid extra for aisle exit seats but did not receive these on the return flight likely because I was forced to accept a flight change after the initial ticket was bought.,Economy Class,5,5,4,3,4,yes,400,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-12-10,Lufthansa customer review,3,Unfortunately the crew on this flight was neither very friendly nor attentive. One of the stewards didn't want to talk he just indicated questions by nodding. The flight was not completely full but the crew seemed to be strained - maybe due to problems with the entertainment system - so that they only seemed to care for the guest who couldn't use the entertainment. I am used to a much better service provided by Lufthansa - my last flight to NY in September this year for example was one of the best flights I ever experienced - the crew was very attentive the purser introduced herself to me and offered me another seat. They even brought me food from the business class.

2014-12-10,Lufthansa customer review,2,LAX/FRA/LAX. 1 of 11 Lufthansa flights in the last 18 months. Some of which were affected by their relentless strikes. I found it to be hit or miss depending on cabin crew. The planes are always clean but never comfortable. The food is always there but can be an insult to taste buds. My last flight was cancelled due to them having a pilot strike. Didn't get that message until a day after which by then was irrelevant. I went to a Lufthansa counter at Cologne airport to get help. Their helpline was hopelessly backed up. The flight crew on both legs of my trip seemed arrogant and unresponsive. I missed the beverage service as I was looking out the window - the flight attendant was one row forward by the time I noticed her and simply ignored my attempts to get her attention. They charge legacy rates for substandard service.

However I was very angry that the IFE did not work in my seat. Despite three attempts to reset it. Kaput! Not exactly satisfying when you pay premium $$ for a seat on a long-haul flight. The onboard wifi was also broken. I do have to say though that the purser came to apologize to me and she did a great job in explaining the situation re all the technical difficulties. Was appreciated. The food presentation and choices were excellent despite the flight attendants' initial insistence on speaking German to me even when I repeatedly asked them a question in English.

2014-12-10,Lufthansa customer review,4,LH 465 from Orlando to Frankfurt on Nov 9th 2014. Despite their marketing campaign on many Lufthansa flights to the US and elsewhere there are still the old business class seats installed. I was on the Orlando - Frankfurt flight. Those seats are not good. Hard not good for sleeping not 180 degree flat but an inclined S form. Other airlines offer a much better business class for less money and on my next US flight I will definitely choose another airline if I find out that the airplane has the old seats. Lufthansa tickets in business class are generally high priced. so I would expect 180 degree seats. Service staff though is very well trained professional and food quality is good.,Business Class,1,5,4,3,2,yes,408,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2014-12-18,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH456. Had the opportunity to fly LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles in Economy (normally I fly business). Was impressed by the overall high standard (the new B-747 I guess) and inflight entertainment is top of the tops. Small disappointment in food and beverage: Food: overall quality good chicken run out two rows before us so pasta only choice. In addition I do not understand why proper bread is not served instead of this white thing that resembles bad quality (Germany has good bread) Beverage: fail to understand why you get 2nd rate prosecco / sparkling and wines. Furthermore non-alcoholic beer was not available on flight. That is cost-saving on the wrong level in my opinion.,Economy Class,3,4,2,5,4,yes,412,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The foot rest was very narrow the IFE screen was big but the movie and TV selection was not too big. Food was good and the portions where generous I enjoyed the crepe for breakfast no amenity kit was offered.

Crew was relaxed and friendly at the beginning but less so at the end. Food a very mixed bag. No sleeping masks or any other give aways. Only upside: Entertainment system of the slightly better version without this clunky old-school remote control but a decent touch screen.

2014-12-22,Lufthansa customer review,8,LH431. Whenever I fly between Germany and the US I try to fly Lufthansa. Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation. The service at Lufthansa is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! Also the food is good and they still offer wine and beer.,Economy Class,2,5,4,5,4,yes,424,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

I felt ripped off when boarding I saw people with 3-4 bags each one when allowed is 1. And moreover I couldn't put my bag over me but 5-10 meters behind me since there was no place where it was supposed to be because a young couple had 2 backpacks 2 bags and 2 sleeping bags.

Both flights arrived on time and Lufthansa provides nice clean aircraft's with very friendly cabin crew. I am very much pleased with the generous leg room in comparison with low cost companies. This is very much appreciated! In terms of the food I have only one comment since Lufthansa gives sandwiches which used to be very tasty. Now they gave us the cheese sandwich which was full of unidentified cream and mayonnaise. It was so stodgy and unpleasant. I hope that the management will make appropriate actions to distribute healthy simple food in the future. Overall Lufthansa is my first choice and it is recommended without hesitation for European routes.,Economy Class,5,5,2,1,4,yes,428,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

More often than not the plane is parked on the tarmac vs. at a gate and there are inordinate delays as the busses don't leave till they are absolutely full - if you are travelling first or business and have got off first or had priority boarding - it really makes no difference as you end up waiting in the bus.

Also the amount of time that it takes to transfer gates during transit and also go through immigration make it easily one of the worse international hubs now.,First Class,4,3,3,2,4,yes,432,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,9,Flight Munich - Washington (LH414). Great seat big TV screen modern and easy to use controls nice materials everywhere. The seat was comfortable and roomy (I was in the window seat). Entertainment was good. Food was also good and a fair choice. Plenty of beverages. Crew was wonderful flight attendants were attentive and friendly. The only thing I would recommend - some more privacy. But overall I had a very good experience.,Business Class,4,5,5,5,5,yes,433,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,10,Flight LH475 from Montreal to Munich on 12/12/2014. A bit delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft from Munich however the delay was almost made up in Munich what allowed me to catch the connecting flight. Appreciate the upgrade to Business Class as Gold Star Alliance member - service great as usual no any problems. Recommend LH for long haul flights - even in the Economy Class the seat is quite comfortable and passenger safety and satisfaction is always of top priority.,Business Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,434,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2014-12-31,Lufthansa customer review,6,LH491 LH431. Whenever we fly between Germany and the US we fly Lufthansa. The seat comfort in Economy class seats is a pain. Business or First Class I can recommend without hesitation. The service is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! We had the seats at the emergency exit which we take if we have to fly Economy as Senator without extra charge as a standard passenger with extra charge. The space you have in this seat is limited the only plus is the leg room but people who try to go to the bathroom step into it hit your legs etc. Wondering why there is no Economy Plus as an option.,Economy Class,1,5,3,3,3,yes,435,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-05,Lufthansa customer review,8,FRA-DTW and DTW-FRA LH 442 and LH 443. Food: It would be great to have the availability of both food choices when sitting at the back of the plane. I'm sure the person sitting in the first rows of economy class didn't pay more than the person in the back and should have the availability to choose between foods. Seat Comfort: The seatmap shown during the self check-in was not the same as found on the plane. In the seatmap during check-in it was shown that there was no other seat to my right. I ended up sitting in the middle seat.,Economy Class,2,4,3,4,5,yes,436,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-05,Lufthansa customer review,10,LH1392M Frankfurt - Prague. On time departure bussed to aircraft on remote stand. Efficient and friendly crew and a lovely breakfast served despite the flight being only 40 minutes.,Business Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,437,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-05,Lufthansa customer review,1,Tried to book seats online for our impending journey to Brazil. Spent an age going through all the information and was poised to spend a small fortune on allocated seats and then found I started getting spurious (but in no way informative) error messages referring me to a (German) telephone number. I decided after several attempts to use the Lufthansa webchat and a nice but not very helpful woman took me all the way through the very laborious process only to inform me after all that their website is not compatible with Google Chrome. So my Sister tried it for me on her PC and it failed yet again. Half the population uses Google Chrome! Lufthansa you really need yo try harder than this. Appalling start to our first ever Lufthansa experience. I am rating the airline on the various categories listed here as it won't let me submit a review without doing so.,Economy Class,3,3,3,3,3,no,438,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-11,Lufthansa customer review,9,I flew Venice-Frankfurt-Delhi on December 28. Initial flight was supposed to be a day earlier so I missed my connection in FRA and was put on a Lufthansa flight to Delhi rather than Air India which was nice. VCE-FRA was delayed by 2hours and I only managed to make it because FRA-DEL was also delayed. FRA airport although I was there for less than an hour was an atrocious experience. I had to speed like crazy to make the flight and still had to go through security one more time and they were extremely rude unprofessional and in no way understanding. This is surely not Lufthansa's fault but it did ruin my trip. Flight to Delhi was on their A380 which I adore. Leg room was fair food was decent although they only had vegetarian options. FAs were extremely polite and professional and always asked if we wanted any drinks throughout the flight. My issue was mostly related to IFE which was not what I expected from LH. Overly German focused and pretty dull overall. Regardless I surely would fly them again.,Economy Class,5,5,4,3,5,yes,439,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-11,Lufthansa customer review,10,LH779 SIN-FRA with A380 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. The C class seat near the window got extra storage on the side and is very convenience. The only problem is the remote control under your arm rest some times you unintentionally hit the remote control and your film stops. I like the A380 very much.,Business Class,5,5,5,4,4,yes,440,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-01-11,Lufthansa customer review,4,I flew on the new 747-8 that Lufthansa put into service from LAX to Frankfurt. The cabin was clean and the entertainment system functioned flawlessly. I was seated in coach somewhat in the middle section. The service was prompt and pleasant. Although I don't eat airline food the cabin crew completed service and quickly quietly cleaned it up. The aircraft itself was quiet and the lighting system was much more pleasant (L.E.D.) than the standard type. Overall better than many other transatlantic flights I've made.,Economy Class,2,1,4,1,3,yes,442,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,7,Basically uneventful flight. Relaxed and stress free boarding. Perfectly on time (both departure and arrival). However cabin staff (on my side of the aisle) was in training. (Hopefully). Forgot things full command of English or German deficient. Couldn't answer question on what the food is. All acceptable however not the lack of friendliness. That is unusual at in my experiences as frequent travelers with Lufthansa.

2015-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,2,I have never felt more like cattle than on our trip FRA-HOUSTON on 1/6. Very crowded cabins with seats too close on the Airbus 380-800. Seats cannot be reserved ahead tried every way possible spent ages on it. Check-in online with actual access to seat map that allows you to chose your seat would make a lot of frequent flyers of all categories much happier. Flight attendants are overwhelmed with issues because of the random automatic system booking. Families are scattered all over the plane. Even after take off there were still people trying to reunite. This mess causes people to try frantically to reserve seats from 3 days before until past the door closures why in the world does Lufthansa want to have their personal overwhelmed with this problem is a mystery they lost my trust.,Economy Class,1,5,4,4,2,no,445,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,8,Vienna - Frankfurt - Buenos Aires (and back): Web check-in worked fine got my reserved seat in the rear of the B747-8. The feeding flight to Frankfurt was uneventful the small snack was okay I also like that you can have a beer on shorthaul flights. The walk to the departure gate was very long but that's not the fault of LH. Flight left Frankfurt on time but arrived late due to the very long flight time of 14 hours (resulting from bad weather over the Atlantic Ocean). Food was okay but less in quantity. I frankly do not understand why airlines cut costs by reducing the amount (and the quality) of food. At least you get alcoholic beverages. Entertainment is now great with a lot of movies/shows to select. I could also find some rest during this 14 hours flight. Unfortunately flight attendants did not make their rounds with beverages that often. Breakfast was very poor! Lufthansa is a reliable and professional airline they usually get you to your destination on time. But I am not really thrilled flying them.,Economy Class,4,4,3,5,4,yes,446,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-14,Lufthansa customer review,9,This was my return flight from Paris CDG to DOH via FRA in Business Class the flight from CDG to FRA was on an Airbus A321 was comfortable with prompt efficient service all on time though I was troubled that at check in although I explained to the staff that I had fragile glass ornaments but they refused to put a handle with care stickers on my bags. The portion from Frankfurt to Doha was on an Airbus A330 with the new business class which was very nice and excellent service with wonderful meal selection I really liked the Bavarian Goose. Though the connection time was very short just one hour but all our bags made it through which was also very nice.,Business Class,4,5,5,3,5,yes,447,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-01-19,Lufthansa customer review,7,Sao Paulo-Frankfurt in Premium Economy operated with a packed 748. Flight left late but made it perfectly on time. I always fly this route with Turkish Airlines in Comfort class (Premium Economy) but this time I decided to give Lufthansa and its new product a try. Seat: absolutely adequate and wide enough. There is plenty of room for your legs. It is ok for getting some sleep. I liked the amenity kit distributed. What I really did not like it's the absolute absence of privacy as the Premium Economy seats are actually not separated in any way from regular Economy class. Very good (and upgraded) IFE. The welcome drink despite very basic (juice) is a nice touch. Cabin crew as always with Lufthansa is efficient similing and polite. But let me spend some words on the food: almost inedible. It is actually the same food you would get in Economy class but served in china plates. Portion are getting every time smaller and food is almost tasteless. The price paid was quite high - overall not the best value for money. I'm afraid Lufthansa lost me on this route as I will keep flying Turkish Airlines Comfort class. Generally speaking Lufthansa remains a reliable airline.,Economy Class,4,5,2,4,2,yes,455,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-01-23,Lufthansa customer review,10,LH 457 1/15/15. My first time in Premium Economy. I will never fly business again. The leg space was great the seat did not incline like in business but still enough to enable me to sleep. The service was ok+ of course not like in business but still very good food and drinks were more than sufficient. I also have to mention the excellent service at the gate. I had been on the waiting list for an upgrade to business which had gone lost though. In premium economy there were only middle seats left which I didn't like. The attendant behind the desk looked into it and found a window seat for me. After some terrible experiences with other airlines (especially British Airways whose economy class has become a joke ever since they decided to divide their aircraft into five (!) different classes) this was an enjoyable experience.,Premium Economy,5,5,4,3,5,yes,462,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-01-23,Lufthansa customer review,2,Flew to and from Sao Paulo via Frankfurt. Already written about the disastrous seat reservation system so I won't rant on about this here again. I would say though that it took no fewer than 4 people at Frankfurt to actually resolve our seating issues. In the end only the Flight Manager was able/willing/empowered to deal with it. The crew on all flights were to be fair very good and the food was fine too. Seats however were very uncomfortable on the B747 so I got little if any sleep on the long 11 hour flights. Also the IFE is terrible. I have a very varied and eclectic taste in TV music and film and found little to entertain me. And to top it all off Lufthansa left our bags in Frankfurt en route back to London and can't seem to drag themselves to get them back to us in Southampton until tomorrow even though by their own admission they have now arrived on a later flight.

2015-01-28,Lufthansa customer review,9,LH 797 Hong Kong-Frankfurt Jan 18 on B747-8. Really impressed by the new LH Premium Economy which I could use for the very first time. Check-in friendly and quick. Boarding efficient. On board a very friendly crew. Once I had taken my seat welcome drink was offered to all passengers in this section. Nice amenity kit at every seat. The seat is simply great much more space than in normal Economy big IFE-screen with huge entertainment options. This was one of the drawbacks of flying Lufthansa but they finally improved it. Meal service from a menu 3 main dishes to chose from. Well presented on fine china. Due to departure at midnight service very efficient but never looked stressed. Wanted to give us more time to sleep. The seat is very comfortable good enough to sleep for 6 hours or so. Of course can't compare with their new Business seats which are top notch. During the night staff came around with drinks and snacks. Breakfast could have been better in my opinion. But that's the only negative point. In all Lufthansa is getting a real premium carrier. Staff excellent efficient friendly and professional.,Premium Economy,5,5,4,5,5,yes,464,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The food was ok but the portion was too small for such a long flight (~11.5 hrs). The seat is very uncomfortable (hard and small cushion) my back and posterior already hurt after sitting there for 2 hours. Nevertheless it was better than a regular seat in Economy Class since I had at least a bit of legroom because I paid extra for an Emergency Exit Seat. I think it is very inappropriate to charge that much money for an Emergency Exit Seat. Overall experience was ok but not great.,Economy Class,1,5,2,4,3,yes,467,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The crew to SIN was very friendly and courteous and took great care of us. On the return it was a little less overwhelming less smiles. IFE in general great more quality than quantity I prefer that. On return flight our screens didn't work and they didn't do much about it apart from suggesting we should sleep. Middle eastern Airlines really made a point and now all the others must follow if they want to stay in business.

2015-02-24,Lufthansa customer review,6,FRA-BOG-FRA on A340-600. As often with Lufthansa I found the flights satisfactory but not outstanding. Airplane looked new the cabin was in good condition and clean (the bathroom less so at least after a few hours into the flights). Beverages were served several times selection and quality were good. Food was o.k. but nothing to rave about except for the very tasty passion fruit cream for dessert on the flight back and the chocolate in between. I am glad though that again there was a vegetarian option. Service was quite friendly and attentive. For a tall person though the space in Lufthansa's Economy Class is really sub-standard: narrow seats leg room barely alright if the person in front of you has the seat in an upright position but very uncomfortable if that is not the case. My seat neighbor who had a center seat could hardly get out of the row. The space on Avianca's A318 for a domestic flight before that was definitely more generous and did not feel as claustrophobic. The IFE touch- screen did hardly react on both flights. Changing the program was therefore difficult.,Economy Class,2,4,4,3,4,yes,477,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

I did online-check in 24hrs before so I only had to go to the bag drop counter. The line was very long so I had to wait a long time. The funny thing was that the check-in line was much faster. Boarding was fast. The impression I got of the crew was that they were very unfriendly and were very stressed. The seats were comfortable for a long flight. Leg space was okay if the front seat isn't reclined. A plus was the inflight entertainment a large selection of movies music TV shows and games. The food was better than average a choice between two dishes. I had the chicken which was okay for an onboard meal. Breakfast was an omelette with spinach and hash browns a plus is that you have a good choice of beverages and alcoholic drinks.

2015-03-04,Lufthansa customer review,2,Flew on LH 958 FRA/BHX on 22 February in business class. The cabin staff did not even bother to close the curtain separating business from economy throughout the entire flight that tells you everything you need to know about Lufthansa's incredibly poor short haul domestic product. I had transferred from a long haul flight where I experienced the new business product which is excellent. I guess the business cabin on short European flights is used mainly by connecting long haul business class passengers - surely nobody would actually pay to fly business on only a short haul flight at least not on LH group carriers.,Business Class,1,3,2,1,2,no,481,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-04,Lufthansa customer review,7,Economy FRA-ORD was ok in many ways on time good seats timely departure and arrival. However advance seat reservation (window seat at a cost of €25) did not allow do identify seats with TV boxes under the next seat thus restricting space.

2015-03-04,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH 418 a very reliable airline. An improvement that they have introduced Premium Economy class. On this specific flight the crew offered water regularly.

2015-03-04,Lufthansa customer review,6,Business class on BCN-FRA-DEL. BCN-FRA flight was decent (same seats as economy nothing to write home about good breakfast warm service) but for some reason was parked halfway down the Rhine valley when it arrived in Frankfurt. Took over 40 minutes to make my connecting flight at literally the other end of the airport. For some reason Frankfurt airport staff thought it necessary for all buses to wait for all passengers to leave the aircraft before staring the long trek to the terminal instead of a bus starting off when full. FRA-DEL flight was on the A380 with the old style angled flat seats. Given that both of Lufthansa's supposedly downmarket brands (Swiss and Austrian) have better long haul business seats Lufthansa has no excuse for continuing with this substandard product. To add to the cost-cutting feel the portions of food served on the flight seemed smaller than those I've gotten in the past on LH. At least the IFE worked fine and has good choice and the staff tried hard to keep the passengers happy. Would recommend flying Lufthansa business only if flying on an aircraft with the new business class.,Business Class,2,4,3,4,3,yes,484,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-04,Lufthansa customer review,9,"I choose Lufthansa over other transatlantic carriers because I have and continue to experience excellent service even in the economy class. I do wish however that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a ""premium"" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the ""regular"" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good although the ""snack"" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights. United's service simply doesn't compare with Lufthansa's and their flights are frequently delayed or canceled.",Economy Class,3,5,4,4,4,yes,485,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-03-17,Lufthansa customer review,5,Flew Business Class from Newark to Stockholm and return to JFK both via Frankfurt. Outbound on 747-800. Beautiful plane and has a high tech feel. New Business Class is nice but somewhat cramped - the seats are very narrow and there is really no storage space. The angled seats puts your feet uncomfortably close to your neighbors. Service on board was very professional and attentive. The meal out of Newark was surprisingly good with an excellent fillet mignon but ground service was lacking - boarding was delayed by almost an hour after it was announced for unclear reasons and the lounge was crowded with terrible internet. Connecting flight on A321 - just economy seats for business class price. Nice service but terrible product. Return was supposed to be on United from Frankfurt but flight delayed for 7 hrs due to mechanical so switched to LH400. Again impeccable service but meal as is standard for Lufthansa out of Frankfurt barely edible - tough lamb with weird vegetables. Desert so small one needs a microscope to see it. The breads served were the best part of the meal. The biggest problem is Lufthansa's angled business class seat. The most uncomfortable business class seat in the air. The IFE system had very limited choices. We circled JFK due to a bad snow storm and then waited for gate forever - total delay of 2.5 hrs. but the crew kept everyone informed and were very nice. Bottom line - highly professional service with sub par cabins.,Business Class,1,5,3,1,3,no,492,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-17,Lufthansa customer review,5,HAM-FRA-RIX: I have travelled this sector a couple of times in past few months and service has always been consistent although at times crew can be sour. All the flights were operated on time on standard A321 without AVOD. I am 189 cms tall and find LH seats hard but I somehow fit in cost cutting can be clearly seen. At all flights informative announcement from cabin. Toilets on LH can inconsistent dirty on some segments. On both flights to RIX crew ran out of sandwiches so we had to take leftover croissants. The crew are doing an acceptable job but they need to work on their snack service. This segment is 2 hours and has enough time to serve a decent snack and please also consider vegetarians. Even though I pay for a premium airline I always have to buy a salad or sandwich from the airport to eat inside the aircraft just because sandwiches are either with chicken or eggs. No vegetarian option and one can't even book a meal for long EU flights.,Economy Class,3,4,2,1,3,yes,493,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-17,Lufthansa customer review,3,I traveled from FRA to LAX on a brand new Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i. The plane itself was in great condition with a wide selection of entertainment programmes and friendly staff providing good service. But economy seating was absolutely not acceptable in terms of seat dimensions. I am a pretty average sized male (187cm 90kg) and my shoulder width was wider than the seat. Same goes for my seat neighbour which meant that we had to sit uncomfortably bent and twisted or get personal. The forward distance was so narrow that my face was only 5 inches from the back of the forward seat when it was moved fully backwards. I tried to avoid the whole thing by upgrading to Premium Economy but I learned that a regular Economy ticket was not eligible for an upgrade. Only Eco Flex tickets can be upgraded but they are so expensive that I would go straight to Business Class instead of buying one of them. Overall I am still wondering what all these bonus miles on my account are good for. Conclusion: When I have an alternative on a direct connection next time I will give the competitor a try. Lufthansa's problem aren't overpaid crews but a lack of respect to the needs of passengers.,Economy Class,1,5,4,5,3,no,494,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-03-17,Lufthansa customer review,7,LH475 from YUL to MUC on Airbus 333. Used the priority check-in for Star Alliance Gold and was served by a very efficient duo of agents. They moved me forward in the cabin and put me in a seat which had a good chance of having the neighbouring seat empty. It also provided extra legroom as it was in a transition row. Aircraft was spotless and bright and the pullback from the gate was on time. Service by FA's was efficient professional and attentive. Two choices of main course was offered for dinner and the food quality was good for Economy. There were several drink rounds throughout the overnight flight and breakfast was served prior to landing. IFE was expansive and offered a great choice of recent movies and other entertainment. Bathrooms were spacious bright and kept clean. Seats were as comfortable as one can expect in Economy and provided reasonable legroom. Flight arrived on time and we were kept informed by the captain at just the right points in the flight. Another great experience with Lufthansa they seldom disappoint.,Economy Class,3,4,4,5,4,yes,495,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

LOTS of legroom though the IFE and tray are both in the armrest (fine by me). Seat was very comfortable and I slept well. Crew were excellent as was the food. Got to watch 2 recent Oscar winning films in the IFE. I love the A340's having the economy class toilets downstairs.

Online check in worked like a charm and the bag drop counter was very fast. As the intercontinental flight was red-eye didn't get to properly check out the IFE but it looked very promising. Food was excellent very good taste indeed. Cabin crew were nothing exceptional but very good nonetheless. Seat on the A340-300 was quite comfortable and I got some good shut eye. Seats on the A320 BUD-FRA were a bit thin but can't complain as it's adequate for the short hop. All flights were perfectly on time and although we had a 1 hour connection in FRA on the return trip we had plenty of time.

The crew to Toulouse were very nice and happy to passengers opposite on the way back. Presented themselves a little arrogantly. The service was a sandwich and a drink service. Fine with me. However they served the exact same sandwich on the way back.

On the VCE to FRA flight we had to wait in the aircraft for around 45 minutes due to problems with snow in Frankfurt. Some people were worried that they would miss their connecting flights but the crew and flight attendants kept us informed about all delays and changes. I got my flight to Dublin on time and it also had a slight delay. I have flown with Lufthansa most of my life and I am very satisfied with the airline.

As I was a premium customer the agent gave me an exit row seat and kept the next seat to me vacant. The service changed for the worst in the departure lounge. First of all they announced boarding for business class and Star Alliance Gold customers. I skipped over to that line to board only to be hauled up by an abrupt and loud ground crew member to be told in front of everyone that ""we are only boarding business class and Gold Star Alliance customers"". I had pleasure in telling her I was a Star Alliance Gold Member (actually Elite with Air New Zealand) and I then boarded. In this day and age no one should ever presume that only people wearing Savile Row suits and Italian shoes are the Premium customers.

On both flights the crew were attentive and smiling and the food was very good. Check in at Kuwait was fast and efficient as was the boarding (for an early departure). The flight was short at just over 5 hours 30 minutes but the crew was relaxed and not rushed offering drinks a nice snack and a choice of breakfast.

As a world traveler I have experienced my fair share of cramped seating but was particularly appalled with the quality of the seating on this flight given that it was an 8-hour flight. The seats bordered on being hard-back chairs with little decline and poor leg room and width. This coupled with a mediocre audio-visual system and totally bland inflight food service left little to like about the airline.

2015-04-12,Lufthansa customer review,2,OSL-FRA-TXL-FRA-OSL. A couple of hours after I checked-in online the day before I was supposed to travel OSL-FRA- TXL Lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my Lufthansa OSL-FRA sector was cancelled due to Lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. This Lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. Furthermore it was all in vain trying to call Lufthansa's reservations in Norway and elsewhere in Europe - lines were too busy to get through. So despite my very busy schedule I went to Oslo's Gardermoen airport where SAS do the ticketing for Lufthansa. In a very short time SAS rebooked me on the SAS direct morning flight from Oslo to Berlin-Tegel therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by Lufthansa and Lufthansa pilots on strike. I paid extra to fly on Lufthansa as I had to be in Berlin early but in hindsight SAS was cheaper more reliable and better than the competition on this occasion - paying a premium to fly Lufthansa resulted as a waste of money time and effort (given the pilots strike not just SAS but also Norwegian and Ryanair would have been better on this occasion). On the return sectors TXL-FRA-OSL the service was very good and significantly better than I what experienced lately on Lufthansa. However all in all this is was the second time in the space of just 3 months that the industrial disputes between Lufthansa and capricious Lufthansa pilots caused me inconveniences while travelling between Oslo and Berlin. This time the inconveniences were not acceptable to me and as a result similar future travel arrangements will be on other Star Alliance carriers but preferably not Lufthansa.,Economy Class,4,2,2,1,1,no,512,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-04-16,Lufthansa customer review,9,ARN-MUC-DEL and return from 2 April to 12 April. ARN-MUC and return both operated by A320s MUC-DEL with an A346 and DEL-MUC with a refurbished A333. ARN-MUC departed on-time had checked-in online and we had selected our seats. Everything was as planned our seats did not get mixed up like they usually do on other airlines. Boarding was smooth as expected. The flight was 100% full overheard the flight attendant saying that not a single seat was empty didn't also find an empty seat when I looked around. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive overall the flight was very pleasant. Next flight was MUC-DEL onboard an A346 unfortunately it was a plane with the old IFE and seats but the outstanding service by the friendly flight crew compensated for it. Food was great didn't expect that good food from LH. Legroom was enough for this flight we landed 20 minutes late in Delhi due to thunderstorms in the area. DEL-MUC operated by an A333 with the new cabin very clean plane. It had the new IFE which was very neat looking however I think they need to add more popular albums and more movies. The legroom wasn't great but it was enough for me I'm 177 cm tall. The flight attendants were extremely friendly on this flight as well in fact all of the LH flight attendants were friendly. I don't like to eat breakfast on my flights but the food wasn't bad flight landed exactly on-time in Munich. MUC-ARN once again operated by an A320 flight was on-time with friendly flight attendants again. They served a sandwich on this flight which was not bad. Overall I'm very satisfied with Lufthansa's service very nice flight attendants they also had very helpful ground crew at DEL.

I needed to freshen up before landing there were no seatbelt signals up so I seized the opportunity to use the lavatory to freshen up. As soon as I finished and exited the lavatory there was a flight attendant waiting for me. I opened the door and this woman was standing in front of the restroom with what seemed like arms folded and a scowling face as though I'd done something wrong. No I wasn't in first class and yes my ""freshening up"" in the lavatory may have taken some time. But at the end of the day I paid for my flight and frankly it is no business of a flight attendant what passengers do in the restroom. She said not one word and basically stared me down as I walked back to my seat.

First leg on the A321 full bar service and tasty hot breakfast was served despite being a short 2-hour flight. Service was excellent and attentive. Second leg on the A380 and sat on a small section of Economy class on the upper deck. There was a dedicated flight attendant for the mini cabin and service felt very personalized and private. He was extremely attentive caring and friendly. Lunch was delicious and substantial and so was the pre- arrival snack. IFE had a good selection of movies TV shows and cool features like the tail camera and the screen was of decent quality and responsive. Seats were comfortable and reclined a lot although under seat storage was extremely limited due to the IFE box.

2015-04-30,Lufthansa customer review,9,MXP-MUC-HND. First leg on time (not many snacks considering it was lunchtime). Second leg on an A340-600 plane full and upgraded to business.

2015-05-01,Lufthansa customer review,7,Flew SFO-FRA on the A380. 11hr 20min in Y. Boarding at SFO was a mess because of some bad handling of their staff regarding priority boarding of disabled people that were flying with us. On board IFE had a decent selection touchscreen not very responsive though. They served dinner and breakfast in the morning. Honestly both were quite good. Staff were smiling even during breakfast in which they surely looked tired but they kept a professional attitude. They gave us a pillow and a blanket (which were acceptable) and the headset (terrible sadly). During the flight water was distributed frequently and you could also serve yourself in the galley for some snacks or some juice and the staff was gald to help. The recline is not bad at all but the pitch is really lacking sadly. No mood lighting also (which would have been a nice touch). Capt spoke frequently to the cabin also because of some sustained turbulence we had that interrupted breakfast: he assured everything was alright but we were unlucky as some strong tail winds shook us for a good part of an hour on the Atlantic. After we landed it was a mad rush to the connection with Air Dolomiti to Verona: FRA is quite huge and we only had an hour or so. All in all a good experience: I find that atm what sets apart an airline with an another is their staff which I found really helpful kind and respectful. I would fly with them again.,Economy Class,4,5,4,4,4,yes,523,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

I travel with LH quite frequently and am always pleased with them especially on their A380s. Downside was the price.

They provide the possibility to chose the seat firmness and include massage. Meals are top notch. there is wide variety of beverages (I got a fantastic passion fruit juice before taking off).

2015-05-27,Lufthansa customer review,6,BHX-FRA-GIG 27/04/15. Return EZE-FRA-BHX 18/05/15. Flight from Birmingham with layover at Frankfurt then on to Rio De Janeiro was nearly faultless. Cabin crew were very attentive and friendly. The equipment used was 747-8 which was a delight fly on. Good selection of in-flight entertainment and food was also good. I asked for a pack of toothbrush and toothpaste and was given straightaway without questions asked and the lady FA had a friendly smile. Flight back from Buenos Aires was somewhat hit and miss. They were asking passengers for an upgrade for a minimum cost. I spent sometime travelling around South America and was down to my last few dollars so wasn't able to avail their promo. I found out later the they have upgraded quite a few passengers even though some of them were not frequent fliers. I am a Miles and More member and also I have got a frequent flier from SK which belongs to Star Alliance and I earned my points for quite some time now. I felt left out by the upgrade and so I asked one of the staff why the Miles and More members had been left out and my queries were rudely brushed aside telling me that 'You only fly economy'. Some of the FA's on board were friendly enough apart from one female FA with a really bad attitude. When I asked for a pack of toothpaste and toothbrush she immediately told me off they haven't got any and why did I bother to asked because I was in the economy section and then she walked away. When I asked one of her colleagues I was immediately handed a pack. I thought that being a Miles and More membership had gone to waste.

The staff were extremely helpful. On my first flight there was a problem with my pre-booked seat so I called customer service to ensure my return flight would be correct. The lady whom I spoke to was very helpful and made sure I got the bassinet seat. For the long flight the staff had little Lufthansa toys they gave my baby I really appreciated the thought and had not experienced this with another airline we've flown with. Staff on board constantly checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed and to see if I needed any assistance (baby slept the whole flight). I will only travel with Lufthansa in the future.,Economy Class,5,5,4,5,5,yes,533,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2015-05-29,Lufthansa customer review,10,I flew NAP-MUN-YYZ. I booked a seat ahead of time the aircraft was changed and I didn't get the seat I had booked. As I was traveling alone with an 11-month old it was important I had the correct seat. The flight was fully booked but the staff were wonderful trying to help me out they managed to find a seat where a lady was willing to switch with me so I at least had the single empty seat beside me and my baby wasn't kicking somebody for 9 hours. The man in the seat ahead of me however reclined his seat fully back 10 minutes into the flight and refused to move it forward even for the meals the staff did their best to make me comfortable. Both at the airport and on-board the aircraft the staff did everything in their power to make my travels as easy as possible. The aircraft itself was new and clean. I am average sized and there would have been plenty of space had I not had another person on my lap. I only gave a lower rating for food as it tasted good enough but I am a picky eater. They came around frequently to serve drinks. I will only fly with Lufthansa from now on.,Economy Class,5,5,4,5,5,yes,534,,,,,,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

2015-05-31,Lufthansa customer review,6,LHR-FRA-HEL both on A321s. First flight left a little late. Food was a small sandwich or a museli yoghurt I had the latter which was ok for the length of flight. Plenty of drink options and an efficient crew. Quick transit in FRA then they decided to change the gate twice. I did receive SMS messages about this and the gate staff were apologetic. The flight to HEL left late as the aircraft was late in from Hamburg. Again good crew. 2 choices of small sandwiches neither I could eat due to some of the ingredients. The stewardess said she would try and find me an alternative and sure enough came back with a chocolate and nut croissant. Unusual for the time of day it was not bad at all and you cannot fault her attempt to find me something I could eat. Going that little bit further shows why LH is one of my favourite airlines.

2015-06-01,Lufthansa customer review,4,I had 8 flights with Lufthansa last month on routes between London and Frankfurt Frankfurt and Gdansk (round- trip) Munich and Kiev (Round-trip) Frankfurt and Kiev (round-trip) Frankfurt and Gdansk (one way). Some flights were with City line subsidiary some with Lufthansa mainline. City line is better in terms of seat comfort (2-2 on Embraer aircraft plus good seat pitch) but no hot meal service. Lufthansa serves hot meal but seating is crowded and provides less comfort. Also City line crews mostly look disinterested. Ticket prices looked excellent value for money. A big letdown was Frankfurt airport experience. Not a single time had we embarkation or disembarkation via finger. Long bus rides only. To add insult to injury when boarding via bus they never used bus gates. We had 5 flights downstairs from Z gates designated for A380 only to stand for 25 minutes on the apron waiting for the bus to pick us up. Then 20 minutes on a bus standing and waiting for plane stand assignment. Overall very average. Flights are on time.

Return trip the bathroom was the dirtiest smelliest mess I have encountered on a plane. Is anyone responsible for checking it during the flight? I have very low expectations of food on airplanes but these meals were worst I've ever had. What really has made me decide to never fly Lufthansa again is this: I paid extra to reserve seats in the first row of economy which has a partition in front of you instead of a row of seats and more leg room. When we checked in for our return flight we were told those seats were not available. I was told by customer service that paying extra to reserve a seat gives you no guarantee or rights to those seats and my request for a refund was denied.

2015-07-04,Lufthansa customer review,5,"This was our first time flying Lufthansa. While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats. I'm surprised that Lufthansa would not have designed this section better and that they didn't have a more accurate seat map.",Premium Economy,4,5,3,5,2,yes,565,,Couple Leisure,Pretoria to Boston via Franfurt,July 2015,5,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The crew served the meal from the same direction, from the back to front of the cabin both times, and when it’s our turn, we only got whatever was left. We can understand this the first time, but the second time it happened we didn’t get to choose our food, we felt being treated unfairly, and to us it clearly showed that Lufthansa did not care about attending to customers’ needs and respecting their right of choice. We paid our fares as everyone else! It is not about we really have to have that particular food, it’s about the fact this happened twice in a row and obviously did not respect customers choice.

Seat wasn't super comfortable and there wasn't loads of leg room, but with the blanket provided it was survivable. For the cheapest option around, that's all I had hoped for.

2015-07-16,Lufthansa customer review,1,"My family took a long haul flight with Lufthansa to Berlin via Frankfurt. They only give us a transit time of 1 hour 5 mins. By the time we came down from the plane at Frankfurt, I happened to look up at a clock in the airport, and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. We walked to the gate, and it was a long walk. An airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area, which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to Berlin. He just said the area downstairs was too crowded, so we cannot go down. He held us up for 10-15 mins. Finally, we were allowed to go down, and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance (as compared to over ten in Heathrow airport). That takes another 10 minutes or so. In the end, we reached our gate 2 mins late, and the plane had left without us. After that, customer service was non-existent. This is no fault of ours. They could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. We were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didn't show up. We tried this for one flight, and I refused to do it again. The next available flight was 5 hours later. But we would have reached Berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to London. I have booked this BA flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in Berlin. Yet we had to miss it. To add to the insult, we were told we had to take the flight to Berlin, or they would re-calculate the total cost.

Enroute to the gate to get the Johannesburg flight we were informed by other passengers that the flight had left. Again there were no announcements. No Lufthansa representative was assigned to deal with passengers that were stranded. The group was split as some passengers did not have visas to enter Germany. After much walking and asking random people what to do, we found a service desk with staff willing to assist. This was also stressful as it was late and everyone was going off shift. The airport was near deserted except for the confused and stressed passengers, some of whom were travelling with small children. We were given a taxi, hotel and meal vouchers for the overnight stay.

I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not Lufthansa´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew.

No english newspapers. We had a little boy with us (8 years old) and when his mother asked for a pillow and blanket, only 2 pillows where found in the whole plane and 2 blankets. We waited a long time until food service started, even economy passengers in back of us got service before us. We were served 20 min later.

The same poor quality seats. We asked for a pillow and a blanket but there was only one blanket and no pillows in the whole plane.

Staff are friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable, and needed to be so, as Lufthansa seem to have a unique way of putting a plane down quite hard onto the runway. My only criticism is with the lack of organisation at the check-in gates, with flights sometimes not being called properly so that passengers mill around not knowing what is going on. This aspect is even worse when things go wrong, as they often do on the trip to and from Salzburg as a result of delays and cancellations due to adverse weather.

Everything in the cabin exuded luxury and precise German engineering. The leather of the seat and the console. The seat movements were effortless. The table slid in and out from the side console without any resistance. It is a quality product. Even the details in the bathroom made it a pleasure to hang out there. Although the cabin has a very open feel, unlike the very private suites on Singapore Airlines or Emirates, there is a side panel that you can lift that creates enough privacy if you so desire it. The catering was superb, as was the service. European professionalism with class. Add to that the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and the drop-off to the plane in a white Porsche, and you get a Top 3 global first class product. If I had to change one thing, it would be the video screen. It’s far too small for a product like this. It doesn’t do justice to the rest of the cabin. My only question now is: why can't LH make their business class as superb in comparison to other airlines?",First Class,5,5,5,3,5,yes,602,Boeing 747-8i,Solo Leisure,Frankfurt to New York,August 2015,5,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Traveling with young children is stressful for any family, but traveling next to unrelated unsupervised kids is surely most people's idea of hell. After 45 mins of arguing we finally managed to secure two pairs of seats in different sections of the plane, sandwiched between strangers. I know it is the modern way to extract every dollar out of the customer through random taxes and numerous surcharges, but it doesn't make any sense to scatter family members throughout the plane.  Maybe Lufthansa should automatically allocate seats for families with young children or be transparent and honest about hidden costs of securing seats. I'm not sure the current policy is very customer inspired for the family traveller or the individual that could be sittings next to an unsupervised, emotional and tired young child.

The food was served relatively fast after takeoff in order to give you as much time for sleeping as necessary. The cabin crew were very attentive, ensuring that passengers do not recline back during dinner and breakfast and giving you a second helping for wine and soft drinks.

On the short flight to Munich from Frankfurt, we were served Leibniz Minis during boarding and inflight, were served only drinks. This wouldn't happen on an American based airline. Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched. The A340-600 is a beautiful aircraft and the flight could not have gone better. All the flight attendants  were attentive, very friendly, and spoke mostly English on flight to Newark. You were served many choices of drinks throughout the flight, given crackers, meal choice was between Cheese Ravioli with Spinach and Beef, and were later given something before arrival. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies, shows, games, and music. My only two issues were at check in, you do everything yourself (weighing, tagging, and placing luggage on belt) and during boarding, it was pretty chaotic.

Business lounge in Frankfurt is also very good with good buffet and shower facilities. And on the 30 minutes flight to Hannover the service was impressive, a full meal was served (see photo). Only the seat comfort on intra European flights could be better. But they stream you the inflight entertainment on your tablet or phone, a great extra.

2015-09-20,"""new personalised long-haul Business Class""",10,"Together with my wife, I experienced Lufthansa’s new personalised long-haul Business Class service on an A380 flight between Frankfurt and Los Angeles. Lufthansa’s ambition is to become Europe’s first five-star airline and measured by the new C-Class service concept, they will get there. The service was impeccable with the flight attendants competently managing the fine line between attentive and personal helpfulness and care – and well-meant, if imposing suffocation of passengers. Kudos to the cabin staff. The food was the well-tasting and delicious food, best I’ve had on a long-haul flight, wines were excellent too. The cabin was well-appointed, colours pleasant, and lots of space for your carry-on luggage. The IFE programme was impressive (but this has become an industry standard, I guess), including the large screens. The not-quite-so-new fully reclineable (‘lie-flat’) seats have been described by others. Since I’ve been flying on the South American services, which appeared to be the last to receive these ‘new’ seats, it was still a new experience for me. Hence a couple of words about the seats: they are certainly not bad. The foot-end is rather narrow – perhaps too narrow for comfort – and I don’t really understand the reasoning behind it. Space in general does not seem to be missing. Another minor issue is the compartment under the in-seat entertainment monitor. This is where you find your kit with socks, toiletries etc. In our case, you couldn’t close it properly, simply because it seemed to be poorly made (I’ve noticed it on a recent 747-8 flight, too). Flying on the world’s biggest and heaviest passenger plane and then not being able to shut a compartment box somehow feels silly. But it’s a detail that in no way spoils the general impression and, indeed, five-star experience.",Business Class,4,5,5,5,4,yes,636,A380,Business,BLL to LAX via FRA,August 2015,5,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Be prepared to walk at lot at Frankfurt airport, especially if you need to switch from area B to area A. Although in the same terminal it takes easily 15-20 minutes.

Having been there a few years before, it's amazing how Lufthansa keeps the service at such a high level. When the plane was ready to board, I was driven to the 747-8 with a Porsche Cayenne. First Class has eight seats, however, on this flight it was only one other passenger and myself. From the moment I boarded the plane, two flight attendants looked after us for the next 14 hours. The seat has to be the most comfortable on any plane these days. I sat on 2A, which is my favourite. Lufthansa did a really amazing job. The amenity kit might not be as luxurious as on other carriers, but it was good for me. They gave me a Pyjama from van Laack in which I could sleep. The food was superb and I was served several starters. One of the flight attendants offered to prepare another main dish if I didn't like the course I ordered. It was followed by desserts and pralines. The service was very kind and attentive without being intrusive.  IFE was great and had a fairly large selection of movies, tv shows, music and other things. When I was ready to sleep, the flight attendant made the bed on the seat behind me (3A). The bedding was almost as good as a regular one from home. They also put something like a mattress on the seat to make it more comfortable. I asked to be woken up two hours before landing in Buenos Aires and so I was.  On this flight, the purser came around three times to check on me and the other passenger. On arrival in Buenos Aires we were greeted by a representative who explained us how the immigration process works and told us that our luggage would be delivered to a dedicated luggage belt.

I was seated at the beggining of my part of aircraft, middle corridor, so no seat was in front of me, although it didn't mean more space for legs. Plane wasn't full, which means that journey was way more comfortable. Many passangers had 2 seats for themselves, some had more. Only one thing that I didn't like was comfort of the seat.

Our seat choices were honoured as well. Food was edible but bland. What impressed me was how Lufthansa dealt with a delay issue (not LH fault) by proactively booking passengers through on alternates while we were still airborne to FRA. What didn't impress me was the lack of enforcement of cabin baggage rules on the US-EU sector, if you werent on the plane in the first 10 minutes of boarding, you had nowhere to put luggage due to all the maximum sized carry ons already occupying the overheads.

Food selection was OK and there was a rather vast selection of beverages available which was nice. DUS to FRA is too short for any kind of service for economy class. The hardware is the Lufthansa hardware for short haul flights. Nice and comfy for short flights. Transfer in Frankfurt was unpleasant due to the long walking distance. I went directly to the gate where the boarding procedures were comencing shortly after. I was able to use priority but the procedure seemed very smooth.

I ordered water and tomato juice, but my juice was forgotten and I was left with only salt and pepper until I had to remind the FA. Approxmately 3hrs after take off dinner was served.

They were continually rewarded with extra attention from the flight attendants, while we struggled to get their attention for basic service. Surely five is too many young children too be in one row, making the flight a miserable experience for everyone seated around them. Lufthansa needs to disperse the children on any flight, so they don't constitute a critical mass of misery for all the paying passengers around them.

I was only re-booked on the next-day flight after I called Lufthansa in Germany. My seat was 85A on the upper deck which I prefer because you don't have a lot people walking around in the cabin. Two to three flight attendants took care of us on this 14 hour flight. The seat is comfortable and the footsie issue a lot of people complain about wasn't a big deal for me. The cabin layout is quite nice. However, it's difficult to leave your seat if your neighbour turned the seat fully flat and you happen to sit by the window. Then you have to climb over your neighbour. The food was great, however this flight was one of the last ones which didn't offer Lufthansa's new catering service.

Premium economy seat is comfortable and spacious, has good recline and very good legroom. Small bottle of water and premium economy amenity kit at seat. IFE screen is large and picture quality is excellent. I like the Lufthansa IFE selection and audio programs are my favorites. As flight is only 7hrs I watched only one movie, but listened to a few music albums. Food is served on tray and I did not see any difference in options compared to economy. Dinner and light breakfast were served during the flight. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient, I felt like a guest, not a passenger. Arrival was with a small delay, connecting flight to Zagreb on clean A319 on time, I slept the whole flight. Miles were credited next day.

The final leg FRA-MAN presented the same problem, this time being an A319. Given that we had the correct row number for the first leg of our outward journey, we have no complaints other than the stress caused by the initial seat numbering.

Most aspects of our travel experience were fine; the check-in process, cabin crew, in-flight entertainment, etc. were as expected. I do have two items to comment on: the selection and quality of the food served, and the discomfort of the headphones. The selection and quality of food was terrible.  Food was inadequately seasoned, no balance between protein, vegetables and starches, and the salad was a joke (a few scraggly strips of lettuce with no veggies at all). The rolls served were ice-cold. Not a pleasant dining experience. The second item was the discomfort in wearing the headphones for the in-flight entertainment. The plastic earpieces were incredibly uncomfortable and the flimsy pads weren't anywhere near sufficient to reduce the discomfort. If we had been on a short flight, I could overlooks these drawbacks, but we were on a 10-11 hr flight, and these things made the overall experience less than ideal.

On her departure from Singapore I was guaranteed that my mother would have access to the business class lounge in Frankfurt on her transfer back to Karlstad as a compensation for their mistake on her outbound journey. (The thing is that there is no business class on the flight from Frankfurt to Karlstad so even though I booked a business class ticket I couldn't get any on that leg).

The seat when fully reclined was comfortable and felt more roomy than the Swiss seat/bed I had on the outbound and I managed to sleep for a few hours undisturbed. The cabin on the A380 was noticeably quiet, maybe because Business class is upstairs. A hearty hot breakfast was served which was tasty and ample. An excellent flight with a stellar crew. Quick disembarkation at FRA and we made our way to the quiet Senator lounge prior to our, not cancelled flight to London City.

I asked the person at the counter, that due to this delay, now I would not only miss my connections but, also have to stay overnight in Bangkok for 10 hours - how would Lufthansa assist. I was informed that my Contract with Lufthansa ended in Bangkok as my connection was booked separately with Thai Airways and not through Lufthansa.  I had  to go to customer service online or look for Thai Airways staff in Bangkok. When I tried to explain to him that it is basic courtesy that he or someone in Frankfurt office communicates this to their Bangkok office in advance, so I don’t have to go looking for their representative at midnight after a long flight, I was informed this is not possible as they had given me an airport hotel voucher in Frankfurt for the delay and had met their obligation and their contract ended the moment I landed in Bangkok. I re-iterated that all I wanted was that they communicate to their team at the other end, so whatever solution they have can be pre-planned, as it was Lufthansa fault. However, it proved too difficult for the counter person to comprehend, and I had to ask for his supervisor, who seemed to understand and agreed to inform their Bangkok team.

The A319 is nothing special there, but great for an hour and a half flight. Service was great during the flights. The flight attendants were very accommodating for us, as we were flying with children. But, unlike some airlines I’ve flown with (ie. Qatar Airways) the staff didn’t really go out of their way to make it comfortable for the kids. As for meals, I would rate them in the top 3 of airlines I’ve flown with. Also, the IFE was one of the best I’ve experienced, with many options for children’s movies. The staff in the airports were equally as helpful.

The outbound flight was a little bit of a mess. 3 hour ground delay in DEN due to snowstorm and de-icing. I understand these things are out of the control of the airline but given that 95% of the passengers were making connections in FRA they could have done a better job of holding flights/rebooking. Arrived FRA and ran to BLR flight and arrived 5 min before scheduled departure to be told my seat was given away. I was unimpressed given that they knew for hours that connections would not be made and they could have held the flight. Gate agent unhelpful so went to Senator lounge where I was immediately booked to DEL. Lounge staff very helpful. Inflight was impressed with all crews, very attentive particularly on the FRA-India legs (which is not usually the case).

Planes clean and tidy, all crew pleasant and a small snack of half a sandwich and one round of drinks served on each flight. Definitely worth the small extra price over the low cost carrier on this route. The only issue for us was the 45 minute transfer in Frankfurt wasn’t enough, we parked remotely and were taken by bus to the terminal which took a surprising amount of time, we then had to clear security again and run to the gate just making the flight. The gate agent was just closing the flight and said she was surprised that we had made it.

Boarding completed about 30 minutes late, we taxied for a while and then the pilot parked and turned off the engines, no communication for 20 minutes to explain what was happening. Waited 3.5 hours on the ground with almost no communication. The crew only came though the cabin two times during the 3.5 hour wait, once with water and once with crackers. Everyone was starving since they had been expecting to get lunch right after take off and was very aggravated by the lack of any service, not even a juice was offered. The kids lunch served (at 6pm) was 5 slices of potato cooked in ketchup with shrimp salad, terrible and neither kid could stomach it. During the flight the crew only came though with water twice on the whole 10 hours.

Really calm and quite up there as not many people moving. The seats are the upgraded business class seats, so they are OK. I must highlight the onboard service which was exceptional in our case.

The seat is absolutely nice and there is a lot of space, I got a decent 4 hour sleep. Crew was there even during flight and offered drinks. Again more plastic and paper cups instead of glass. Food same as economy and the service is no different, because the premium economy has not a separated cabin. It is open to economy after the 4 rows. Nice is the small amenity kit with a toothbrush, paste, eyeshade, earplugs and socks. I would say that the seat is the best shot LH took. They still have to work on the service to provide a truly premium economy. For almost the same price we could have been in business class on a middle east carrier.

We were travelling with backpacks which fit in the carry on luggage sizing rack at the gate.

Two of us quickly repacked our packs to the satisfaction of the gate agent. However, the third member of our party was unable to repack as quickly and was threatened with having her ticket cancelled.

I had pre-ordered a meal, but the cabin crew did not notice it. Thus I had to ask and wait my meal. The seat was good and comfortable. I could recline it much more to the back. For the value of money, upgarde to premium economy for long route (more than 10 hours flight) is worth. The flight entertainment was not spectacular and contains old movies.

On this route LH has introduced the enhanced restaurant service. Guess it is a very nice new touch but it didn't work out at all on this flight. Seemed like it was the first time for the team as the purser kept telling them what to do and they seemed pretty overwhelmed with the additional work. Overwhelmed and stressed with a warm smile though. The restaurant service will probably be a nice addition once the crews are trained. Other than that it was another great flight experience. Have been a Senator with Lufthansa for almost 15 years. After some years if downgrading I am very happy to see how much they have improved their entire product.

When booking online, by mistake I booked the return flight not one month later, but one year later. When I noticed the error I immediately contacted LH, but due to office closure hours etc. was only able to actually speak to someone more than 24 hrs after booking and was then told that I could only correct the return flight by paying an additional EUR65 change fee per Person (and additional cost as the corrected return date would only be available at an even higher tariff) – the ticket price per person for this less than 1hr flight would have reached astronomical heights of more than EUR 400 per Person. The only other option would be to file an online complaint (they don’t take complaints by phone) asking for a waiver of the change fee. I went down that option and now one month later I still have not received any reply from them, seemingly they just have too many complaints.

The seat comfort is a mayor plus compared to the standard Economy Class. Nowadays there are so many Premium Economy or Economy Plus concepts that you don't know what to expect. Lufthansa has done a great job. It's an almost independent class with very comfy seats. The seat offers 18 cm more legroom, is wider and has a relatively big tray table (comparable to that one in Business Class), power sockets and IFE on high definition touch screens. The service was very professional, friendly and efficent. The purser of this flight welcomed us personally. On this A340 the Premium Economy consists of only 19 seats and has it's own compartment. It is quiet and you can deboard quickly after arrival. The food is almost the same than in Economy Class, but served on china and with a menu and some real glasses. After boarding you get a non-alcoholic juice cocktail. Food quality and quantity was fine. You get plenty of drinks. IFE and WIFI worked also really good. At your seat there is a water bottle and nice amenity kit. The flight was almost one hour ahead of schedule. It was a great experience.

IFE great, especially movie section which even managed to present more obscure movies; as a Dane I appreciated no less than 4 Danish movies. Audio acceptable too.

Allthough Lufthansa flight attendants are very service minded, a few stressed through the dinner serving. A rather ordinary meal (chicken and rice is not a highlight when you have been travelling in rural South America for several weeks). We hardly managed dinner before everything was collected. IFE as good as usual. Seats felt narrower and harder than on the outbound flight on an A340-600, being similar to the rather unconfortable on Boeing 777 in 3-4-3 arrangement used by some airlines.

The service was not good for Lufthansa. For example, one half of the section of the plane where I was sitting (at the back) received meal menus, but not the other half. The meals were reasonable, but the seat was narrow and the meal trays so small that it was difficult for me to eat without spilling anything. And the staff kept bumping the meal trolleys against my elbows as they passed. The plane was one of Lufthansa's new 747s and I expected the seats to be wider and more comfortable. The other segments of the flight were better. The flight from Amsterdam to Frankfurt was very smooth and the cabin crew combined great efficiency with being pleasant also. The cabin crew on the Tokyo flight seemed less efficient and depended where you were seated. The flight from Haneda to Hiroshima  was a 787 operated by ANA.

Next morning I contacted them and trying to be in touch by telephone is really difficult. But I heard that the bag was send from Munich but ""never arrived in Madrid"". I was told to contact Lufthansa Germany but there is no way to do so. Finally, the person at the Madrid airport connected me to a man in Germany and he was very supportive and understanding. He promised that they would do everything to locate the bag. I filled in form after form, online and on paper, describing the content of my bag and the specifics which could help to identify it.

Addis airport is the usual smoke-filled chaos it has always been. Repeated security checks make your journey through this airport frustrating. Welcome on-board was friendly and helpful. Premium economy seating is directly behind the business class cabin on the A330 (3 rows) with only a small 30cm partition hanging from the ceiling between you and the row behind, which is regular economy. If this is a well thought out marketing tool - I applaud LH, however I would prefer an entirely separate cabin with separate toilets (these became very dirty and did not appear to be attended to by the cabin crew for hours at a time). Some passengers from the economy section tried their luck by moving to a Premium economy seat but were soon informed that there is an ‘extra charge’ for that seat. They soon went back to their seats in economy. As this was a night flight with a stop in Jeddah we were offered a substantial snack just after take-off (at about 11:30pm local time) after which I settled in to sleep through the stop in JED if possible. The snack was a hot meal (I chose the vegetarian option) nicely presented on a small tray with chinaware and metal cutlery. A choice of wines was served in glasses and additionally, an amenity pack with all the basics you might need for the flight was provided (including those socks that no one ever, ever uses!). I have heard it said that the PE food service is identical to the economy offer. While I could not see what the passengers behind me were eating, the method of service is very different and you do feel that you are receiving an elevated standard of service. Prior to take off in Jeddah, welcome drinks were served (juice). I settled in for the night after that so missed the meal service and woke only for breakfast, which in itself tells you that the seat is comfortable enough to get a decent night’s sleep. The adjustable headrest with head support makes all the difference. If I am to offer a tip, take the first row of Premium economy if possible, on the aisle. These seats have extendable leg rests (not just the ones that are fitted to the seat in front of you) and so offer support to your entire leg/calves which makes for a more comfortable journey. LH PE is NOT a watered down C Class product. It IS economy. However, the enhancements are good and sufficient to make a ‘sky-snob’ like me feel that it was money well spent and (sorry Lufthansa) money well-saved from the full C class fare. I felt that I was a premium passenger but was left in no doubt that the C class product (which could occasionally be peeked at through the curtains) was entirely superior - as it should be.",Premium Economy,4,4,5,5,5,yes,810,A330,Business,ADD to FRA,May 2016,3,5,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Every thing on both flights went like clockwork with true German efficiency just like Aldi but with Waitrose quality. The food was handed out quickly but politely and the real clincher was the rubbish was collected at just the right time so as not to leave you with the tray down for ages. Even my grandchildren at 11 and 12 travelling with us were impressed. So on our many trips planned to Malta it's Lufthansa or bust, cost won't come into it but will allow at least 2 hours for transfer as can't gallop these days at over 60.

2016-06-12,"""PE well worth the extra cost""",9,"✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to Addis Ababa with Lufthansa. The connection in FRA is laborious and involves lots of walking. I took a leisurely stroll directly from my arriving flight to the gate (stopping for a little shopping for around 10 minutes) and altogether it took almost an hour to navigate through the airport, the mono-rail, the security checks, the other security checks and then to the gate. That said, when I arrived at the gate, boarding had just been called so the timing was, in fact perfect. I am impressed with the number of people on the ground to assist you with the transit. It seems there are no end of red-jacketed people to see that you go in the right direction. The crew were very welcoming and bright. Before take off a welcome drink of minty orange juice was offered in plastic wine-style glasses. After take off menu cards were distributed and pre-dinner drinks offered. They commenced with the meal service a little while later but had to abandon it due to turbulence. A helpful announcement was made, apologising for the delay. Two choices of main course were offered which were served on china and with metal cutlery. Red or white wine was offered from a full size bottle with water (sparkling or still). I have a little gripe with the way the service is ordered as I have noticed that on every flight a refill of wine is not offered until just before the coffee service. I would like to be offered a second glass of wine with my meal. After coffee (quite a long while after) after-dinner drinks (Cognac or Baileys). I asked for a refill of coffee at this point – it came about 10 mins later. A chocolate was also offered. Prior to landing in Jeddah (refuelling and crew change) a small half-sandwich was offered (no choice) and this was followed by a glass of orange juice served from a tray. Another gripe is that there is no tidy-up of the cabin during the re-fuelling stop. There were vast numbers of strewn blankets, discarded cups and every conceivable wrapper strewn all across the cabin and they remained there for the rest of the flight to Addis. I don’t really understand why either the departing crew don’t do a once-over, or a cleaning crew pop on board to do a quick tidy while we were on the ground. Overall, I like the LH PE service. I do not have other PE products to compare it with, but for me, it does what it says on the tin. Gives that little bit more attention and comfort to the economy traveller.

Last time I flew the gate was at the B concourse which is quite a trek before you have even started your day. Excellent flight. Boarding announcements at gate 18 LHR T2 were unintelligible so that worked well for me as I sauntered up to the gate before others realised that boarding was called. Quite simply the friendliest crew I have encountered in a long time. Just after take-off a breakfast was offered of cake, cheese or salami sandwich.

I was almost refused boarding because my return flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was booked for a date which happened to be beyond the extent of my 90 day visa-free stay period in the country. I understand that airlines have to adhere to the rules as stipulated by immigration laws, but ultimately the decision to allow me to board the flight rested with Lufthansa’s flight manager who proved to be stubborn and neither susceptible to reasoning nor my explanation that I was not intending to spend the 5 months in Singapore but would travel in the wider region. It took almost an hour of arguing back and forth with several Lufthansa representatives before I was finally issued a boarding pass.

No showers, 90's style fax machines and Internet terminals (I wonder who has ever touched them in the last 10 years or so), worn down furniture, lousy food and lots of mediocre alcoholic beverages. Not the kind of place to relax and refresh yourself after a busy day before your evening inter-cont flight.

2016-07-20,"""seats are narrow and tight""",5,"✅ Verified Review |  Flight from Hong Kong to Luxembourg via Frankfurt. First leg with Airbus A380-800, upper deck business cabin. I've had the 'pleasure' of flying Lufthansa Airbus A380-800 in economy cabin and it was a horrible experience, unfortunately flying with business is a similar experience. One of the worst business class cabins I've flown - seats are narrow and tight, if you do not get a window seat there's no storage space at all for anything (window seats come with additional storage space along the fuselage) so every time you have to get up and reach the overhead bin. Film selection is so-so, the only positive side are the noise cancelling headphones. Food was average at best, service was mixed - the flight attendant taking care of my section was great, smiling, friendly and speaking English. I've noticed that on numerous Lufthansa flights that cabin crew first of all has this cold business attitude and tends to speak German, even if you speak to them in English. The second leg was ok, with a typical short haul flight seat, space and service - nothing special worth mentioning. At that point I would also suggest to avoid travelling through Frankfurt as this airport is a disgrace with rude and puzzled personnel and long waiting lines. The only bright point is the Lufthansa Welcome Lounge with extremely nice and helpful staff. Overall I would not recommend, next time I will fly with Swiss which is way better.

Because the first 20-minute YYJ-YVR connector flight was by Air Canada, on-line check-in had to be on AC website rather than LH website, even though all three flights had LH flight numbers and it was an LH ticket purchased on the LH website. The two airlines had recorded different booking codes for the trip, so only by telephoning LH was it possible to obtain the equivalent AC booking code in order to proceed with on-line check-in. YVR-MUC leg (10h30) aboard an A330-300. Main meal was the chicken or stuffed pasta, bland but adequately filling; while second meal was negligible, a couple of snacks as one might purchase from a vending machine. FAs very helpful throughout, making regular runs to offer water or juice, with full beverage service available from the galley. AVOD offered a vast array of films, music, and television programs. The A330 had a 5cm gap the armrest and the fuselage on each side of the plane. The armrest should, instead, be right up against the fuselage to make use of that wasted 10 cm. As well, the A330 had IFE system boxes under the seats. Footroom was severely reduced and it was impossible for any standard carry-on bag to be accommodated except in the overhead bins. (Have previously travelled on LH A330-300 with much better seat design accommodating full-sized carry-on bags beneath the seat, although still leaving the wasted 5 cm gap between the armrest and fuselage on each side.)

My boys wanted to have aisle seats, thats what we got. Lufthansa has a very good special meal programe free of charge, which if you order ahead, gives you the opportunity to chose between 20 diffrent mealtypes. I chose indian vegetarian.

The food was good (a salade nicoise and a dessert), adequate for the time of the day (5pm) but a little more could be expected, as everything looks a little bland. The purser, however, was very attentive and friendly. I really like the Lufthansa  colour scheme as it gives the whole plane a classy look.

I have to mention the weird announcements in Spanish back from Mexico City as they were super bad and I believe they should hire some native speaking crew member becuase the whole plane was laughing at the very weird accent. Food was good on the outbound flight but mediocre on the way back. A few more complaints - boarding in FRA was pretty disorganized and slow becuase the automatic machines were out of order and no priority was given to PE passengers. On the final leg from MUC to Milan, they displayed 1h delay on the screens so I went for breakfast: when I was done I realized that they had moved it back to its original schedule so I rushed to the gate to find out they had just started to board.

However, while trying to board the plane, I was denied entry and I was informed that all the rest of my segments were canceled, including return from ATH. They argued that I missed the 1st segment (the bus) and when I complained that this is only a bus, they said that they treat the bus the same as the plane (keep this in mind).  They wanted me to buy a new ticket, because my ticket was not rebookable and then see when I would fly! After much grief, they allowed to board; fortunately there was 1 seat, but warned me to call LH as soon as I got to ATH. So I did and asking them to show me where are these terms stated (that is, if I miss the 1st segment and in particular the bus, all are canceled), they couldn't.

Music and newspapers were plenty, though. We had the seats in front of the emergency exit rows on the A321. The seats were good for economy class seats, although they did not recline (minor issue with economy seats in my opinion, since they do not recline far anyway) and were a bit less wide compared to the other seats. However, these are one of the few seats in a pair arrangement on the singe-aisle A321.

I booked Premium Economy as I usually do on other airlines where available. Overall, I thought that whilst the flight was comfortable and reasonable value, the Lufthansa Premium Economy was not as good as other airlines that I have used. There was just a few rows within the Economy class and the only thing to differentiate Premium Economy from Economy was the seats and legroom (which were fine I might add). The food was the same as Economy (very average both ways even by Economy standards although printed on a different Premium Economy menu), shared the same stewards on board and at check-in and boarding there was no separate boarding queue for Premium Economy. Whilst these are not big issues at all I do feel that for paying twice the airfare they might have offered slightly more to differentiate it from Economy.

The plane from FRA to PTY also departed on time. Throughout the whole flight crew was present and did their best to make us feel as comfy as possible. There were 2 hot meals, snacks and plenty of drinks. What I can recommend Lufthansa, though, is to enlarge an IFE choice, especially the movie collection.

2016-11-28,"""find yourself another airline""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  I was supposed to fly out of New Delhi to Boston via Frankfurt on 26th November when the pilot strike was extended and I became its latest victim. My flight to Frankfurt was just a few hours away when I got a text that the other leg of my journey from Frankfurt to Boston had been cancelled. I could not afford to be stranded in Frankfurt and nearing panic and desperate, I managed to book another flight through British Airways which would land me in Boston just a few hours later than the cancelled Lufthansa flight. So seventeen hundred dollars and a lot of heartache later, I finally landed in Boston. The following day, I decided to reach out to Lufthansa customer service to inquire about my refund for my cancelled flight. A curt lady told me that the refund was in process and would take anywhere from a couple of days to a week to go through, but she would not divulge the amount to me. I went ahead and told her that I had spent $1700 to rebook my flight just so I could be back in time for my wife's surgery at which point I was told, and I quote - ""that was your decision and your problem. We are not liable for it"". So, was it my fault that Lufthansa decided to cancel my flight because of the pilot strike which is their own internal problem? And they have had this issue for years; their cabin crew and pilots have gone on impromptu strikes for the past couple of years now and the ones to suffer are the gullible passengers. Lufthansa reported recorded profits this year and it is not hard to imagine where most of that money came from: their gullible customers who they so merrily swindle at every opportunity. The only reason that I have posted this review is that I do not want another person to go through what me (and probably thousands of others) have suffered at the hands of this inconsiderate and greedy airline. I would dearly suggest to you that if you are booking your flight at least a month in advance, you are better off going with a more stable airline, as Lufthansa is very unpredictable and can cancel flights and leave passengers stranded with no recourse whatsoever.

2016-11-30,"""satisfied about the service""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  Going out to Funchal was a memorable experience due to service minded staff and really good food. Going back was somewhat different, as staff seemed tired, and the fact that Economy class stewards were in charge of Business class when the business class FA were having a break. Pushing the Cabin Attendant button did not make anyone come. Two very different experiences. No IFE was provided on the four hour flights between Funchal and Frankfurt, which is not good enough. However, there was an entertainment App available, but you need to download it before taking off. It's not available for Windows Phone, and when you get informed about the App, it's too late to install it, as flight mode is required, which to me makes no sense.

My flight from Birmingham to Munich was cancelled and I was slightly stressed, because I had to get back. Upon calling Lufthansa, they suggested that I could take a later flight on that day. As this was not possible, I asked them if they could book me a flight with British Airways from Heathrow. I did not expect this to be possible, as I was calling them some 6 hours before the flight (from LHR) and the ticket costing around 5x as much as my economy light ticket on the LH flight.

I mananged to re-book our flight to Porto the day before and we flew with two other St Alliance airlines. That was still OK. The problem arised before our return flight. Lufthansa sent a text message our flights were cancelled and advised to look for alternative flights. The link provided in the text message didn't work (server error), neighter did their phone contact - all lines busy, please call later (repeated several times). We lost a few hours trying different contacts via mail, phone - nothing worked. Eventually we decided to take a trip to the airport and talk to their staff there. They re-booked our flights, but more than half a day was lost. That wasn't the end of the problems. When we arrived to Arlanda our checked-in suitcase didn't. As the baggage handling staff explain, it was because of our flight was rescheduled. I could understand that unsatisfied employees go on strike, but I'm also convinced there should be a functioning emergency plan for that kind of situation. It wasn't the first time I had problems with Lufthansa.

The flight departed on time and onboard service was solid and reliable. For the FRA-BOM segment we were on the upper deck Business Class section of a new B747-8. Lufthansa has dropped the ball in the manner it has configured its new Business Class seats. They are narrow and angled towards your co-passenger in the row - a disaster that could have been avoided if Lufthansa hadn't gone cheap.

Flight departed not on time owing to the weather conditions at Dulles, but Lufthansa and German Air Traffic Control managed our flight to land on time. Seat comfort was nice with plenty of space left for my knees. Nonetheless, my seat was broken and therefore it reclined all the time which was awkward for the person sitting right behind me. Flight crew was outstanding. They did their job always with an extra smile and I told one flight attendant about my damaged seat and he dealt with the situation and offered me a new seat, which was fantastic. Food was okay, which was also down to me as I am not fond of Camembert cheese. Drinks were available all the time in the galleys and also offered by the crew throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment offered plenty of films in several languages which was a nice touch as well. The only thing bad about this flight was a rude female passenger next to me complaining about me going to the loo twice at this 8 hour lasting flight, but that is not Lufthansa's fault at all!

An online-form where I had to fill in my visa details for China got stalled. But things where quickly sorted out by the check-in attendant. Priority boarding with my colleague was not issue, as we travelled as one ground. Nice aircraft, with nice leather seats. Yet, these seats where a firm and offered little side support.

This was a special trip to Northern Italy for Christmas with my extended family and an Aeroplan reward ticket. We left pretty close to on time and they made up time on the way over. As soon as we boarded, I changed into the pyjamas and settled in for the overnight flight. Champagne and macadamias arrived quickly and on the seat was the Rimowa amenity kit. Meal service was delicious from the amuse bouche, caviar, black pepper pasta and I think it was chocolate bread pudding, though I was so full I couldn't. The wonderful champagne, I had the old world red and a lovely port. The crew on board couldn't do enough for us yet it still felt really private with a full cabin. After dinner, they made up the bed with a comfy top and bottom duvet and I got almost 5 hours of sleep. Breakfast was fresh and wonderful, I ate light as I had a 6 hour connection in Frankfurt before flying to Milan. My favourite part of flying first on Lufthansa is the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. This is a separate building with no gates attached. You walk out the main terminal doors and turn left and it's a five minute walk. Take the elevator up and they personally take care of you from then on. You can do this not only as a departing but as an arriving first class passenger too. The whole place is bar, they have a smoking room with, and I don't smoke them but my friends would love the cigars. Shower/bathrooms, private snooze rooms and comfy wing chairs and ottomans to sit and read a book. One of the three bathrooms has not only a shower but a full on soaker tub too. I booked it and read my book until my time came. Lufthansa understands that some of us still love to fly and it's about the experience and the swag. Sitting on the bath tub was another collectible Lufthansa First Class Terminal rubber ducky to add the collection. I had a delicious breakfast in the a la carte restaurant, the mimosas and long espressos were great too. It was Christmas after all and vacation. When time came to board they escorted me downstairs to a waiting limo (they have a fleet of Mercedes, Audi, BMW and Porsche vehicles from sedans to SUV's). They drive you across the tarmac to your next flight. I find it hard to fault Lufthansa these days, I like the whole experience in the air and on the ground. There are rumours that LH will discontinue first from North America, I hope not. I could get where I'm going in a shorter route but I consistently fly the long way round to Europe to experience this kind of service.

We arrived late on the Air Canada flight from YYZ to FRA and missed our connecting Lufthansa flight to PNQ. There was no special arrangement to hurry the transit passengers to their flight. We had to wait for 3 busses to be filled as we were parked on the tarmac, prior to moving to the gate. Upon reaching the gate, we checked with the ground staff available and they told us to rush to the specified gate for our flight. We had to walk there, which we did, along with other passengers. By the time we reached the gate after going through Security, it was 5 minutes to the departure time - we were told that the flight had departed and we had to walk back to the customer service counter from where we had come for additional assistance. They advised us that they had not been intimated that we were on our way to catch the flight (along with 2 other passengers), even though we had our boarding cards. The Lufthansa ground staff insisted that it was the fault of Air Canada as the flight was operated by them.  They said the earliest connecting flight was at 7:00 am the next morning via Delhi. I had to remind them that there was an earlier one LH0760, which they agreed to put us on. They got us the tickets and told us to rush to the terminal to catch the flight before it left. We asked for a cart and were told none was available (we happened to get on the cart which the other 2 passengers who had also missed the flight were given by another ground staff). We had to go through Security again and had issues with the alcohol we had purchased in Toronto.  We requested an upgrade due to our exhaustion and inconvenience, which was refused.

Only through the grace of about a billion points was I able to snag a Newark to Dusseldorf reward flight to experience Lufthansa’s renowned First Class on my way to a final destination of Lisbon. I felt somewhat unworthy as I settled myself into my 2A open suite, however, I worked hard to maintain the requisite “I belong here” demeanor, unlike the fellow in front of me who danced in the aisle, champagne flute in hand, celebrating after his boss switched seats with him (boss relocating to Business). The A340-600 First Class cabin was full. I spent the first fifteen minutes sipping champagne, enjoying macadamia nuts, and playing with what seemed like several hundred seating variations from which to choose. Service, food and beverage was for the most part stellar although once it was ‘lights out’, our two attendants did somewhat of a disappearing act, although I’m sure they would have been prompt if I had rang for service. The dinner service was outstanding, caviar first course, followed by a trio of appetizers, lobster main, chocolate dessert, complimented with some excellent tasting wines, and all served course by course on a well-sized and nicely laid out dining table. An after-dinner aperitif coupled with a cappuccino (and a few more sweets thrown in for good measure) concluded a wonderful dining experience. Seats were promptly converted into comfortable looking beds with myself as the only hold-out. With privacy dividers raised, the group settled into a state of individual slumber. I chose to catch up on a few recent-run films through the night. A perfect photo-op of a sunrise appeared much too early, as did the perfectly prepared breakfast offering of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  Finishing my breakfast, I changed back into my streets in the very spacious and clean washroom. There was a noticeable lack of interaction with the flight crew. Except for the obligatory “Willkommen to, Danke für” announcements from the flight deck, nothing else was offered. Perhaps the pilots were feeling miffed with their airline, and working to rule, choosing not to associate with even the first class passengers as has apparently happened in the past. The Lufthansa First Class experience is truly special, and not only the in-flight portion, but the other touches such as personal escort from check-in, past security, and into the lounge, as well as the lounges themselves, the service and amenities offered on either continent. As I left the sanctity of the First Class section, a sense of claustrophobia overwhelmed me and I realized I was turning my nose up at Lufthansa Business Class! And, as I sat in TAP Business on my flight segment to Lisbon, with my all-on-one lunch tray crowding my thirty four inches of pitch, I reflected on how fortunate I was to have experienced the Lufthansa First Class product.

2017-01-07,"""extremely miserable experience""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Chicago to Moscow via Frankfurt. Extremely miserable experience from business class travel.  Our flight from Chicago was delayed due to some technical problem with the aircraft. Ok, I get it, troubles happen. We had to wait 2 extra hours in a rather miserable United lounge in Chicago. On the aircraft in 2 toilets out of 3 in business, the toilet seat was not holding itself while opened - meaning you have to hold it. When the aircraft was landing some of the next flights were announced to be rebooked, but neither my flight, nor my husband was. Even though there were some flights departing after our flights, we were not announced to be rebooked. When we came out of the plane, there was a service person from Lufthansa answering questions. My husband was guided to the service desk and to me the men standing there said: ""if you run you can catch your flight"". It was 9:30 am and my initial flight LH1444 was boarding at 9:15 in a different zone (we landed to Z zone in FRA airport and my boarding was at B gate). Knowing that FRA is one of the biggest airports in the world I though it may be reasonable to go to the service desk with my husband and ask for a change of the ticket as ""running"" through the airport was not an exactly appealing option for a person with a knee injury. However, when we came to the service desk, there was a man guiding the queue to service desk windows and he also told me that I should run to catch my flight. It was 9:35 AM (as mentioned before, my boarding started at 9:15 AM). So if two people told me I should run I decided to leave my husband who was traveling to Prague and try to catch my flight. The trouble was that few steps later there was a different zone of the airport, then I had to go through train and security check, being out of breath when I finally came to the gate it was 9:50 AM and my flight had already left. The lady at the desk said that she is not willing to help me and I should go back to the service desk and change my ticket. In the lounge, they changed my ticket to 12:40 pm. Same time was the flight time for my husband, but as he was flying to Prague, and me to Moscow, we had to stay in different airport zones and were not able to come to each other. When I was boarding the plane, there was no walkway, but a bus, and they were saying that business goes after families with children to the bus. And the employee on the desk was extremely rude, screaming at business passengers they should wait till all children go the bus first. On the plane, the seats were not even with adjustable head. We had to wait for 45 minutes (plus to 4h flight) for some luggage to be loaded-unloaded and for some passenger to come to the plane. During this extra time of waiting in the aircraft there were no drinks offered. ",Business Class,1,1,1,2,1,no,914,,Couple Leisure,ORD to DME via FRA,January 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Following a smooth check-in we proceeded to the lounge which was sweltering hot and had a very poor selection of food and no cold drinks. The departure was delayed due to late arrival of inbound aircraft and further delayed due to late boarding. However, there was no explanation for the reasons of delay or an apology from the cockpit. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept. It was the European business class configuration with the middle seat of economy style seating left vacant. The FA's were friendly and efficient which was the only redeeming feature of this journey. The food was below acceptable for Business Class and a huge letdown for LH.

2017-01-10,"""the crew had arrived late""",2,"✅ Verified Review |  Munich to Sofia. The Lufthansa return flight ruined an otherwise perfect holiday. Flights were late on both legs of the journey. On the outgoing flight the explanation given was that the crew had arrived late the previous night and had to use up their 12 hour day rest, so the next day flight was delayed. Our return flight was cancelled 40 minutes before scheduled takeoff. Of course no explanations given, but considering that most other flights were departing on schedule it must not have been the weather. We were quickly rebooked to another flight 4 hours later. 30 min before takeoff that flight was delayed by 1.40 hours, so by the time we boarded we had almost 6 hours of delay. The flight did not depart at the newly announced time either, since doors closed more than 40 minutes later and by the time we were airborne it was another hour late. The flight itself was ok and apparently we made up for some of the delay. Little did we know that after landing we would have another hour of delay, this time waiting for our luggage. The crew's bags were delivered earlier but the passengers had to wait until 1.20 am to get their bags, with noone from Lufthansa or the ground handling operator to explain what was going on. So instead of getting home at 6 something p.m. the previous day we got home at almost 2 am on a Monday - not ideal if you have to go to work at 8.00 am (wish I had the ability to delay my start of work for the 12 hours rest, like the Lufthansa crew).",Business Class,3,5,3,,1,no,917,,Couple Leisure,MUC to SOF,January 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Why does Lufthansa bother to offer a specific Hindu Non-Veg Meal if in reality does not provide such a meal? The flight attendants were wonderful on board and did what they could. But they could only offer me yet another Non-Meat Pasta Meal because the other one offered was a Fish Meal which I do not eat at all.

After a very nice dinner, and watching a couple of up to date films it was time to settle down for a few hours sleep. After another good breakfast we landed on time at Frankfurt, and then made our way to terminal B for our flight back to Edinburgh on another A320.

Lufthansa's Business Class product is looking jaded and mediocre and no longer feels like a premium experience. A reason is the terrible seat layout with little privacy and the cabin feels and looks crowded. The B747 seats are slightly more comfortable than the A380 with better space around the seats. The onboard service is good, the flight attendants well-trained and efficient. The wifi service was highly unreliable and the $20+ fee seems a rip-off when there are so many breaks in service.

2017-01-24,"""staff very friendly and attentive""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew Lufthansa Business Class from Munich to Barcelona on January 8, 2017. Our flight was supposed to leave from Munich's new Terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the Star Alliance Schengen Business Lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Munich right now is going through a phase of Siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didn´t make it to the airport on time"". Funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. During that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside Terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. Boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasn´t forthcoming. Boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off Terminal 1 which LH doesn´t even use. Our A320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. In fact we didn´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. Obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. The flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in Barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. The Lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on European flights is worth the money in my opinion even if LH European business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. But the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean. Flight announcements were sufficient and comprehensible and came in four languages. All in all, I would recommend flying LH business class on European routes, and I would recommend that LH improve their ground services in MUC.",Business Class,4,5,4,3,4,yes,928,A321,Family Leisure,Munich to Barcelona,January 2017,3,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2017-01-24,"""flight was quite pleasant""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew Lufthansa business class from Barcelona to Munich on January 15, 2017. Apart from some minor ""beauty defects"", none of which turned out to be Lufthansa ´s fault, the flight was uneventful and quite pleasant. We spent some time at the ""Sala Pau Casalls"" business lounge which is a total let-down (see my separate review). Boarding was unpleasant because the announcements were totally incomprehensible and the Airport Operator AENA seems to be finnicky about hand baggage sizes. They refused to let me take my trolley bag onboard because, despite the fact that it has the required dimensions, it expands when it is fully packed. They didn´t mind about that at MUC but they do at BCN. My bag was checked in and arrived on the same flight as myself in MUC, so no major disaster, but you have to be aware of the situation. The business class experience on this flight was pretty much the same as on the inbound MUC-BCN flight - friendly and attentive staff, good food and drinks, good legroom etc, but our A321 was older than the A320 on the inbound flight and had a sort of fixed tray table spanning the free middle seat which is unnecessary and uncomfortable. There is no inflight entertainment except via the downloadable LH app, which some people will object to, but I don´t. The flight took off almost on time and landed punctually in MUC despite the nasty winter weather.

At the gate, I discovered that they gave the same boarding pass, with my name, to my colleague. This was most unusual considering at check in they would have had to match my colleagues boarding pass to the name on his passport. Consequently my colleague had to return to the service desk to sort out the mix-up. Boarding was smooth and o board the aircraft appeared well kept. Following take off we were offered drinks and then lunch. I was seated in the second row of a very lightly loaded business class. When I told the FA what I wanted for lunch she apologetically said that they had run out of that choice. The meal I settled for was well presented but lacked taste. The dessert was dry and inedible. Wine selection was okay but I would have liked more choice. The seat was reasonably comfortable and allowed me to have two hours of decent sleep. IFE was mediocre with a sparse selection of new releases. The FA serving my side of the aircraft was friendly and courteous. Flight left slightly late but arrived on schedule. This was my second flight in Lufthansa's business class in less than a month and I am starting to think they are cutting corners.

If they can combine this with proper snack service, it would be great as not all passengers are into drinking alcohol. A warm bread roll would be a good option.

This flight was LH1348 between Frankfurt and Warsaw and although it is a relatively short flight, it is always connected with a long-haul to Frankfurt, so after 10 hours of flight-time, being crammed into coach seats is never welcome. If you have not flown Inter-Europe flights, most airlines do not have a separate business class configuration. They use coach seats and then do not book the middle seat. The service is upgraded in these seats, but you are basically being wedged into coach seats at a business class price.

2017-02-16,"""no surprises with Lufthansa""",7,"✅ Verified Review | I took Lufthansa flight LH457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt as the first leg of a trip to Warsaw. For this flight, Lufthansa uses the standard A380. I sat in seat 11D (middle row) in the upper deck. The first thing you feel in boarding this aircraft is that Lufthansa is efficient, courteous and professional. The cabin is clean if not a bit bland, but overall has a comfortable feel to it. The configuration is a 2-2-2, so the middle row is the best bet, as each seat is an aisle. The seats are comfortable and are lay-flat. My only issue is that the controls for the seat are touch and therefore, if you are resting your arm on the armrest, you seat tends to ""readjust"" itself if you brush against the controls. In the lay flat position, the seats are typical of most airlines as they are not exceedly wide, like Singapore Airlines, and narrow for the footwell. One issue is that your feet land on a ledge on the bulkhead which has only a small divider between your feet and your neighbors. Often during the flight, I was awoken as my seatmate changed position and her feet brushed mine. A minor inconvenience, but for some may be too creepy. The service on the flight was very good, if not at the personal level of some of the Asian competitors. The food was decent, but not exceptional and misses the touches of other airlines like ANA, Singapore or even Austrian. The in-flight entertainment is very good. The TV screens are large, clear and easy to see both in the dark and with the cabin lights on. The screen is operated by touch or a remote. You have a massive amount of choices and they seem to have many of the latest movies. Overall, the flight does what it is advertised to do. It gets you there safely, comfortably and in timely manner.

In addition, there were some extras like a welcome drink, a menu and an amenity kid. While I would not describe the food as being superb it was tasty (choice between Indian vegetarian and Western non-veg). The A380-800 is a wonderful and exceptionally quiet aircraft, especially in the front part, where the Premium Economy seats are located. The cabin there also had a more secluded atmosphere. The plane looked very new and was in good condition. The tray could have been cleaned more thoroughly before boarding, though (in Frankfurt as well as in Delhi).

This was bad enough for a 7.5 hour flight but as soon as we were in the air the passengers in front of us reclined their seats, the backs of their seats came back to very near our faces. Also with their movement we got our knees whacked. What really gets me is that we paid for what comfort Economy Class offers but this was Sub-Economy standard: we would have had more room to move in an animal crate in the hold. Trying to read or use a laptop was so awkward that we had to give up. The laptop could not be opened more than 45 degrees. We hit some turbulence along the way and were told to buckle up. After a long period of no turbulence my wife had to go to the toilet, as soon as she got into the aisle she was told in a very commanding voice to sit down. This happened again later on when the need was desperate. Still no more turbulence and again ordered to sit down.

It so happened that a trip to Malta this year got one of those ""rescheduled"" flights. This time, I did get rebooked onto alternative flights to my liking, however, I it was a nightmare... with several emails, phone calls, a visit to the airport in Malta (only to be told to call their call centre in South Africa. To cut a long story short, Lufthansa keeps stooping lower even when you thought it had reached rock bottom. I've come to the conclusion that flying Ryanair is probably better than flying with Lufthansa (maybe, cheaper too).",Economy Class,3,2,2,,2,no,959,A320 / A321,Solo Leisure,Oslo to Malta via Frankfurt,January 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The food quality on Lufthansa was very good on both segments, but the service was even better on FRA-DEL route. I purchased full day wifi pass and it worked all the way from LAX to DEL.

I did not like the Boeing 747-8: it is a new generation of aircrafts, but it feels like Boeing rushed it to the market to counter the excellent A380.

The Premium Economy on Lufthansa's B747-800 is strangely squeezed between a mini Economy cabin in the front and the main Economy cabin in the back. There are no separating walls or curtains, which kinds of defeats the ""premium"" feeling (therefore, the 2 dedicated toilets are used by everybody). The seating configuration is 2-4-2 (vs Economy 3-4-3). The seats are wide and recline well, but the foot rest is not well thought out for people over 180cm. The food is basically the same as economy, with an extra dish and served on real china and glasses (but Lufthansa's food offering is good in all classes anyway). Would I book it? Only if the price difference is minimal at booking. Best is to book the cheapest economy and ask for a 299 euro upgrade at checkin or gate in Frankfurt (which is a really good deal on very long flights). Avoid middle/window seats, as it is difficult to get out if your neighbour sleeps.

2017-04-15,"""they refuse to give me the £80 back""",3,"✅ Verified Review |  I recently flew from Manchester to Atlanta via Frankfurt and back with Lufthansa. I was travelling as part of a group and so decided to book a seat to be close to friends. I was surprised that on a flight that cost nearly £1000, I would have to pay to choose my seat but I decided it would be worth paying £20 each way per person for myself and a companion to ensure that we sat together (£80 in total). The first issue I had was that the seats we were given on the flight from Frankfurt to Atlanta and the return leg were not the ones I had booked. We ended up on the very rear row of seats but we were at least sat together. On both flights (10 hours) we were served vegetarian food because apparently Lufthansa only offer chicken to those toward the front of those the plane. To make matters worse, I was later offered a hot dog for lunch, because they had run out of pizza. The hot dog was still completely frozen. I didn't make a fuss, I thought that I would get a refund for the seats and that would be the end of it. The flight itself was comfortable and smooth so I wasn't too unhappy until I spoke with Lufthansa customer services. They told me that the seat booking fee is non refundable and that booking a seat only entitles you to that ""type of seat"" and does not mean you will be sat in the seat that you chose when you made the reservation. So ultimately I have paid for a seat that I didn't get, I had the same type of seat as everyone in economy and yet they refuse to give me the £80 back.

Both outbound legs were uneventful despite an hour delay leaving FRA, arriving 20 minutes behind schedule into PEK. Found the Boeing 747-800 series a tad cramped for such a large aircraft. On the return leg our flight left PEK over two hours late due to only 2 of 3 runways being operational. The captain kept passengers well-informed during the delay as we'd been on the aircraft for quite some time. En route, due to the significant delay we discovered we would miss our connection to DUB. Staff onboard kept everyone informed as many connecting flights would be affected. We did indeed miss the DUB flight but we were put up in an airport hotel overnight in FRA with dinner & breakfast provided. Impressively, we informed of this and the new flight arrangements a number of hours before landing into FRA. The next morning we were flown to Oslo and then onto Dublin with SAS (Star Alliance) as all FRA-DUB flights were fully booked for Easter weekend. The first time flying with Lufthansa and was very impressed with the cabin crew, pilots, checkin staff and gate & rebooking staff as we were a 50-strong school group and they dealt very efficiently and professionally with our concerns around the delay and missed connection. Food was frequent and decent for Economy class and the entertainment system was very good also.

Next problem is at boarding which is total mayhem with economy class trying to board at once resulting in delays and a scramble for overhead locker space.

2017-05-23,"""great crews, great service""",8,"✅ Verified Review |  Washington to Birmingham via Frankfurt. This was my first experience with Lufthansa, products I experienced were Economy on the A319-100 and Premium Economy on A340-300. I opted to fly with LH as they offered both the best price for the overall trip and the most favourable times to work with my journey plans. I had initially planned to fly Economy for the entirety of the journey; however, the additional cost for a premium economy seat was so minor that it made sense to elect for the premium option. I made the booking using the LH website initially, which was fine, but then opted to manage my booking using the mobile app. The app I found to be very cumbersome and slow. It took some navigating to make simple amendments like seat choices or adding API/visa data.  I didn't have hold baggage for this journey so my exposure to ground staff was minimal. The first leg of my journey commenced at BHX. The check in process proceeded without issue; however there was a slight delay with boarding, and we departed 30 minutes late. This made me nervous given that I was meeting a connecting flight, however the cabin crew were friendly, informed us of progress and connection plans at all times. I was seated in 10A, and exit row seat with ample leg room. We were offered a basic snack (marble cake) and a juice/coffee. Service was expedient and pleasant; which is how I would describe all of the flight. After landing at FRA I proceeded to my next flight. Unlike many airlines there aren't many ground perks for flying PE with LH. no lounge access, no priority boarding. The enhanced comfort offered on board however is more than worth the cost. The PE seats on the A340 were akin to retro business class seats. Wide, with built in IFE and tray table, with a foot stand (I was in 10A again). I had an end of aisle seat which meant I was not reclined in to. The catering option offered with PE is the same as economy, served on China and with metal cutlery and a glass. It doesn't sound much but it in fact makes the experience considerably more pleasant. We were allowed use of the business class lavatories which was nice given the economy toilets were a good 15 rows back. The cabin crew overall were friendly and helpful. They seemed cheerful and willing to do as much as they could to enhance your experience. For the flight back I elected to pay to use the IAD Lufthansa BC Lounge. It cost a mere $35 and was worth every penny... however, it lacked some of the comfort and grandure usually associated with lounges. As an economy passenger I wasn't particularly fussed but If I was a BC passenger paying a flexi fare (i.e. a lot of money) I'd have found the lounge to be understaffed, A little untidy, and lacking in food options. The return legs were almost identical to the outbound; same aircraft, same seats, same comfort, friendly crew. The food on this occasion was served in tins, but this can be overlooked. Again the crew offered use of the business class lavatories which I appreciated. Overall my first experiences with Lufthansa were good.

I was going to upgrade to Premium Economy, but reviews said it was pretty much the same seat and food as regular economy; so, I didn't. Online check-in was easy using the booking code, but there was no option to upgrade. To find that out, I had to go to a service counter in Munich. Flight out of Budapest was late, but staff were apologetic about it. Boarding process in Munich was a bit chaotic, since they did not inform passengers about the pre-boarding document check (which seems redundant, since they are not Customs, and we all already went through customs). Staff on the flight were friendly and attentive. They re-arranged seats for a couple with an infant, so that they could use the bassinet in the first row. The woman who gave up her seat got a voucher to use for duty free. These are really nice touches that show they see their passengers as real people with real needs. Alcohol selection was excellent: sparkling wine, wines, beers, liquors, and cognac for after the meal. The meal was fine. I liked the chicken, and the real cutlery. The entertainment system is worth choosing Lufthansa over other airlines that are offering less for within $200 of the the price. There were hundreds of movies to choose from - from many different cultures. The system was really responsive and quick. The screeN is at least 25% bigger than the ones on Air Canada, and it adjusts to more angles. USB plugs were easily accessible, right beside the screen.

The aircraft was in a very good condition, however, the seats were the skinniest I have seen. First leg was very short so we didn't expect much as usual, however, the second leg was the longest we've felt on the plane. For an 11 hour long flight, we were served the first meal after 2 hours. I always order a special meal, but I regretted my choice as it was bland and tasteless. The second meal came an hour before landing and it was in a small box, not a full meal. For an 11 hour flight. They did serve drinks a couple of times in between the two meals, but we didn't want water the entire flight.  The attitude of the crew was alright. My screen was dodgy, so I simply didn't bother to watch anything.

My career is in Hotels hence I tend to focus naturally on food and service and have to admit both were exceptional. The upkeep of the facilities were very good.

Already At Check-in Lufthansa provides First Class service: If one wishes, a staff member guides you through the Fast Track in Security in Los Angeles to the Lounge, and if requested from the lounge into the plane. This service is very much appreciated, especially, when the special fast track building site is shut down due to power loss, as it happened to me and one is guided efficiently through the very long queue of regular security. First Cabin in on the main deck in the nose of the aircraft and very airy. The design is very nice, and very seat has still the beautiful and fresh red rose. The only disappointment is the small size of the screen and the quality of the bed (not the best flat bed is not the best in the industry.

Lufthansa provided a real masterclass in customer service on our flights from Edinburgh to Bejing. All aircraft on our outbound and return journeys were spotlessly clean. On the A380 to and from Beijing, the cabin crew were a delight: friendly, attentive, and hard-working - treating economy customers as if they were as valued as first class customers. We did pay extra to sit in the upper cabin, but on check-in were moved to the lower cabin, but were quite happy as we were given seats by the exits with extra leg-room. The in-flight catering was superb - two good meals on a ten-hour flight and snacks, and frequent runs with juice, water and red or white wine, as well as a full bar service with each meal. Plenty of choice on the entertainment system, with the latest films. All flights departed and arrived on time.

I knew that I had only 1 hr 15 mins in Frankfurt to catch the connecting flight to Zagreb. When they announced in Vancouver that the plane would be 45 minutes late, I was sure I wouldn't make it. However, in Frankfurt they had ground personnel waiting at the arrival gate and then transferring us directly to the connecting flight. This was very nice of them, especially since I had a car rental waiting on me in Zagreb, so it would be a lot of hassle to handle it if I were a few hours late. The flight from Vancouver to Frankfurt was enjoyable: comfortable seats, 2 meal services, and endless supplies of drinks in between. Had a lot of sleep time. The staff were quite friendly.

Lufthansa's onboard First Class service is a model of efficiency and precision. The hard product is very good on the A340-600 but not as good as the one on Lufthansa's A380. The lady flight attendant tending to me was outstanding in every respect, and it shows the training Lufthansa provides for its premium cabin staff. The overall experience is one of comfort and understated luxury. Topping it all was the superb First Class lounge in Munich.

Hand luggage was promised to be returned at the aircraft upon landing. When we landed however we were instructed by airport staff to move to baggage claim without support from Lufthansa personnel (there was nobody from Lufthansa at the gate). A group of us decided to stay behind and eventually got our luggage from Lufthansa but this caused a significant delay which caused me to miss my train.

2017-06-27,"""required a visa to transit""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  I was due to fly from Marrakech to Istanbul today on Lufthansa and when I arrived at the check-in desk at Marrkech Airport they refused to allow me to check in, claiming that I required a visa to transit Frankfurt, despite the fact that Germany allows Transit Without Visa for Moroccan citizens and I had already transited Frankfurt on the same ticket with no problems when flying from Istanbul to Casablanca on Lufthansa just three weeks before. I phoned Lufthansa reservations and they told me that I was right and that I absolutely did not require a visa for a 1 hour transit and I should try to check in online instead, which I did sucessfully. However, the Swissport staff at the airport still refused to give me a boarding pass and allow me to board the flight. They claimed to have phoned German immigration in Algeria but refused to give the name of the person they had spoken to. Their refusal to check me in led me to miss my flight. They refused to provide anything in writing despite me asking several times. I wasted an enormous amount of time and money getting to Marrakech airport, paying for a hotel there, car rental and reserving accomodation in Istanbul. Lufthansa took my money and then refused to allow me to travel. It appears that buying a Lufthansa ticket is like a lottery ticket - maybe you will get to fly somewhere but maybe you will just be told ""no"" and then the ticket that you paid lots of money for becomes worthless. I recommend avoiding Lufthansa as it appears they don't care about connecting travellers and can leave you stranded at a whim even if you have the right documents for your destination.",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,1004,A320,Solo Leisure,Marrakech to Istanbul via Frankfurt,June 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

We originally had seats together on the TXL-FRA leg but we couldn't get seats together on the 12 hour long flight. There was no desk at which one could check in without a boarding card upon arrival so the woman told me to go to the gate and check in there. After waiting in a queue that didn't move for over an hour despite the desks being open (extra personnel arrived later), we got to the desk and the attendant couldn't check us in together and this time, on neither flight. The service was horrible. Currently we are waiting to depart and there is neither personnel nor plane at our gate when we are meant to fly out in 15 minutes with no update on how late the flight is.  The options for in flight entertainment were largely disappointing, even for bilingual passengers. The flight 2 weeks ago from HKG-FRA was 30 minutes late causing us to rush to make our flight from FRA-TXL (Berlin). The onboard and ground staff were unhelpful in trying to fast track us through to our next flight. I have never flown on a long haul flight without the rest of my party.

Victoria to Vancouver  20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada Jazz used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops; and Munich to Geneva by Air Dolomiti on Embraer E195. Vancouver to Munich on A330-300 aircraft. Air Dolomiti flights had comfortable seating, and featured a couple of different regional Italian wines on each flight. LH Premium Economy seating was 2-3-2 across (instead of 2-4-2 in economy), with an extra four inches of legroom (35-inch pitch). Extra legroom and footrest were welcome but seats were narrower than they ought to have been. Between the window-seat armrests and the fuselage was a 5-cm gap on each side of the plane, and all seats had tray tables in the armrests. The front row of Premium Economy also had IFE screens in the armrests – small screens half the size of those in the other rows. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 1½ hours before landing. The meals seemed to be  regular economy meals – chicken or pasta options for the main meal – except that in Premium Economy they were served on porcelain and serving size may have been slightly larger. IFE was good, although films and TV shows were classified in unexpected categories. Outbound connection from YYJ through YVR is always easy because domestic passengers can remain on the secure airside to international flights without a further security screening at YVR. Connection through MUC was better than a year ago because, although you have to go through passport control entering the Schengen area, no extra security screening was required there either. Likewise on the return trip, no further security screening was required through MUC leaving the Schengen area. When entering Canada at YVR you have to go through Canadian Border Services inspection and collect your baggage but even at that point, for passengers connecting to domestic flights, they provide a dedicated area for onward baggage transfer and a dedicated security checkpoint. Despite connection times of only 1 hour to 1½ hours at YVR and MUC, both my bags arrived with me at the destination. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone AC to ask for the AC booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.",Premium Economy,4,5,3,4,5,yes,1013,A330,Business,Vancouver to Geneva via Munich,June 2017,5,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Dessert were some cookies and an unbelievably tasty orange and pistachio creme.

Even on flights not longer than 40 minutes, they are serving drinks and there is a full service, the only difference being that on a longer flight you would maybe get a sandwich while on a short flight it's crackers.

2017-09-12,"""beverages were rarely offered""",7,"✅ Verified Review | Flight from Seattle to Frankfurt, start afternoon in SEA, arrival early morning in FRA, so it was a night flight. Unfortunately, aircraft was a Boeing, thus seats much narrower than in an Airbus. Flight on time and very calm - usual, very good Lufthansa standard. However, cabin staff was not very attentive and sometimes even rude. Beverages were only rarely offered, collection of garbage even more rare. During the night, cabin staff went through the cabin with beverage trays, but did not look carefully if some passengers might be awake and wishing something to drink. About 2 hours before landing, I asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage, i.e. three empty cups. She said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products (which I know) and she had other guests to care for. She would be back later. I asked when as I was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing, and she said ""soon"". I did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept, just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast, whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. Had a flight with Air Canada from Frankfurt to Calgary three weeks earlier, and they offered beverages much more often, and they also collected garbage. It was my first time that I experienced rude Lufthansa cabin staff, but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during long-distance flights, and they also collect garbage more frequently. Breakfast: only savoury, omelette with roasted bacon and onions. I prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of German breakfast on a flight to Germany with a German airline: some bread, butter, jam, maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. I am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers' wishes, but a choice between a Northern American breakfast and a continental (German) breakfast would have been highly appreciated. Why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner (pasta or chicken)? I still recommend and choose LH for short-distance flights within Europe.

2017-09-14,"""It was impossible to sleep""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment.  I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldn’t the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt  I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled.

2017-09-26,"""the flight was canceled""",5,"✅ Verified Review |  I was flying from Nice to Graz via Munich. I found out that the flight was canceled for whatever reason and the replacement was not possible because it was Sunday. We were told that we would be transported to Graz by bus, which would take more than 5 hrs, and if we had any other questions we should go to the service center counter. I went to the counter, where I was told to wait for an hour until the additional information would be available. When I asked them to re-book my flight, they said that the only option would be to go to Vienna and then to figure out by myself how to get to Graz because most probably the company wouldn't reimburse me the money for the trip from Vienna Airport to Graz. I went back to the gate, got a 10-euro voucher, and was told to come back 45 mins later for the latest updates on my canceled flight. When I came back to the gate, the ground team announced that we were going to be taken to Vienna by a plane provided by a partner company (Austrian) and transported to Graz by bus. This sounded more or less as a solution, but we were then asked to wait until 5pm to get on the plane.

Also, the entertainment system features a screen that has not met pixels and a navigation page that is dismal. Service was efficient if not warm. The food was really lousy for business class. Even a salad was terrible. The contrast with our outbound flight to Munich could not have been sharper. We connected from Athens in Frankfurt and our flight was 55 minutes late. There was no one at the gate or anywhere to direct us or to say if our flight was being held for us.

Long line of people queing to board not by row numbers, little delayed in leaving. Sat down the back by the tail, seat 93e. Short of crew on this flight for some reason, could clearly see the results as the service was slow and the crew function like robots, no smile, just doing the motions.

Service was good, with delicious sandwich and German beer served in glass bottles. Extremely long transit walk at Frankfurt, nearly one hour gate-to-gate, with extremely rude security staff. Chaotic boarding at Frankfurt. One unacceptable thing onboard Lufthansa flights to Hong Kong is that all announcements are made in Mandarin (language in China) instead of Cantonese (main language in Hong Kong), except the safety video which makes the service inconsistent.

Despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from Munich to Vancouver, our experience was frustrating, flat out disappointing. We could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. Error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online, your name, ticket number etc may be incorrect, and your routing does not match your ticket. Error messages were different every time we tried so you didn’t know what exactly was the reason. We were questioning whether he even had a ticket. Called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 24/7. We had to wait. Tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. Had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly int’l roaming charges for calls. Original gate from ATH-MUN was rather close to our MUN-YVR, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. On arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight. Boarding an A330 MUN-YVR was a disaster. Other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. If you’re a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. Passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it. Safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go. Upon arrival into YVR, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in MUN and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. They were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. Total 40hrs. We wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from Lufthansa. It has been 7 days and still no response. ",Premium Economy,3,2,3,3,1,no,1075,A330 / A320,Family Leisure,Athens to Vancouver via Munich,October 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2017-10-18,"""onboard service is above""",4,"✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Addis Ababa via Frankfurt. The onboard service is above average and the legroom is good. However, I had booked to leave on August 25th. On arrival at Schiphol the flight was canceled. Overbooking on another flight was not possible, everything was full. Other flights to Frankfurt departed that evening. Also on Saturdays there was only place on flights with at least three stops and a journey time which was twice as long as planned. Then only one flight took 2 days (!) Later, which cost me 2 days. Cancellation can happen and the fact that there were no good alternatives was not to blame Lufthansa. Where I can admit that Lufthansa does not wish to pay my claim. They indicate that the flight was canceled by the weather conditions. That's strange if you take into account that this was the only flight that was canceled that night, KLM just left Frankfurt. One could easily leave with a delay of an hour or so. Now, in addition to the lack of working hours, I have to make expenses to get what I am entitled to. So service on board 8.5, handling complaints a 2 - the staff is friendly, average 4.2 so. DUTCH: De service aan boord is bovengemiddeld en de beenruimte is goed. Echter ik had geboekt om op 25 augustus te vertrekken. Bij aankomst op schiphol was de vlucht geannuleerd. Overboeken op een andere vlucht was niet mogelijk, alles zat vol. Andere vluchten naar Frankfurt vertrokken wel die avond. Ook op zaterdag was er enkel plaats op vluchten met minimaal drie stops en een reisduur welke twee keer zo lang was als gepland. Toen maar een vlucht 2 dagen(!) later genomen wat mij 2 dagen werktijd kostte ter plekke. Annuleren kan gebeuren en ook het feit dat men geen goede alternatieven had is Lufthansa niet te verwijten. Waar ik mij wel aan kan ergeren dat Lufthansa niet mijn claim wenst te betalen. Zij geven aan dat de vlucht geannuleerd was door de weercondities. Dat is vreemd als je in ogenschouw neemt dat dit de enigste vlucht was die geannuleerd werd die avond,KLM vertrok gewoon wel naar Frankfurt. Men had dus makkelijk met een vertraging van een uur of zo kunnen vertrekken. Nu moet ik dus naast het gemis van werkuren onkosten maken om te krijgen waar ik recht op heb.

2017-10-18,"""their service was appalling""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Newark-Liberty Intl to Munich, LH0413, 18 Sept 2017. I did not expect something elegant or sophisticated from Lufthansa, but their service was appalling. The flight was delayed due to ""late arrival of the plane"". Quite worn out plane, not much of a welcome on board, dim light in the cabin did not make me feel bad in the beginning but definitely was not comforting. I do not mind not smiling FA's if the level of service is high. On this flight, I learned for the first time what means lousy service in business class, definitely not expected from 4-star airline. Frugal menu had one appetizer (salad) with no other choices. I chose fish for the main course which was greasy, overly salty and poorly presented. Everything came on the same tray. During the meal, no drink refills were offered (I had regular coke), so I had to ask for a favor. After I asked for the tray to be taken away, FA took it and asked me to throw the tablecloth and serviette on top of the tray. I expected a dessert would have been offered but was wrong. So again I had to ask for one. Not happy with my request, FA asked what I wanted and finally brought a portion of fruits which was placed on the table without any preparation. After such ""feast"" I tried to sleep but the seat was (though full flat) bumpy and extremely narrow even for me (I am a slim person). So the only comfortable position was lying on my side. Finally, I was able to fall asleep but was awaken soon by the noise from the galley where FAs were loudly talking without lowering their voices. About 1 hour before landing I asked for breakfast. It was not served right away, so the seatbelt sign came on. FA told me that now the breakfast could not be served. No single positive emotion during the whole flight. Extremely lousy service is only memorable thing about Lufthansa. My flight back with United (Polaris business class) was a pleasant surprise – frankly, I expected the opposite for these two carriers. Lesson learned: Lufthansa’s business is an awkward decoration of a comfort+ class with a flatbed (though very uncomfortable).

On my last flight from Lisbon to Frankfurt there were 6 people queuing up in the aisle waiting for the lavatory making it almost impossible for business pax to use the lavatories. This for some reason is standard procedure on LH. Another problem I have with them is that the crew uses the overhead bins for their own luggage leaving practically no room for their so called ‘priority customers’ which are seated on rows 1&2.

We have to congratulate one staff who was the flight customer service most friendly in the world, specially with my mother who needed a wheel chair arriving Frankfurt from London on Saturday 11 of November. He took us as if we were his family (we were 6 people) and guided us wonderfully through this huge Frankfurt Airport to the Hilton Garden Hotel. However at the following morning (Sunday 12, November) despite we asked for similar service (a wheelchair), Lufthansa failed totally. We waited about 45 minutes in the Hotel reception, to received a laconic communication from the airline explaining that was ""system failure"" and did not book the service. On the other hand, Lufthansa services and his workers in the airport are in a bad mood. Returning to Panama was an odyssey trying to get information about the process of check-in. And we had to weigh our luggage and put the tags ourselves?

One thing I had to complain about (I guess that is more a Berlin TXL problem than LH) is that there were no open check-in counter in Terminal C where this flight departed. I guess it was because usually LH departs Terminal A but there was no space for the 747. There might have been a problem for people with checked-in luggage or people who wanted to check in at the airport. The flight itself was the best I have had so far. The crew was very friendly, the entertainment program was good and they gave everyone a chocolate teddy after landing. The space between seats was good, I'm 1.67m and I could stretch my legs - I guess there were 10-15cm to the seat in front of me.

Again I had to fly with Lufthansa from Berlin Tegel to Frankfurt. And again, as often the case, plane was late because of late arrival - or because they changed the aircraft to a larger one.

2017-12-02,"""will avoid Lufthansa connections""",2,"✅ Trip Verified | Budapest to Venice via Munich. The first flight from Budapest departed with 20-30 mins of delay. This is ok as delays can occur and the duration was rather short. However, arrival in Munich was also delayed in turn by 20-30 mins. The connection in Munich was known in advance to be short, for which reason it is expected that the airline has foreseen how to manage this flight combination. Instead this connection was managed very poorly. Arrival in Munich airport took place at the gate area K, while the connecting flight (to Venice) was at gate area G. This, according to the screen indication itself, requires 17 mins of transfer time. Upon arrival, I noticed on the screen that the connecting flight was already boarding. After taking the shuttle train (needed for this transfer) and running the rest of the way, I arrived at the gate only to discover that the flight was gone. It seems nobody bothered to advise that there was somebody on the way, and hopefully the plane could wait for a mere 10 mins. Offering a connection implies that it is reasonably managed. In spite of the short connection in this case, it seems the airline makes it even worse by setting flights at different areas and not advising of people in transfer. I would never ask a plane with all passengers to wait for a long time, but I do not believe 10 mins would be an issue for anyone. After the above experience, I went to the service desk for help, where I was told that there is ""fortunately another flight tonight"". That meant at 22:00 vs. the original 15:30 that I missed. To illustrate the staff's further lack of customer service, I was told I am eligible for a voucher since I will spend a long time at the airport. I was given a voucher for 10 euros. After indicating that a 10-euro voucher does not seem exactly a correct response from the airline for the trouble caused, I was told that maybe it was a system error, and after a second check, the staff confirmed that in fact I am eligible for 17 euro. I did not continue the discussion as it would have been a waste of time. The above service gives me an impression that the airline simply does not care. In fact it feels like a joke. In any case, I would have expected a much different treatment for a company with a German origin and reputation. Obviously for the future I will avoid this specific flight connection, but I will also avoid Lufthansa connections in general as well.",Economy Class,3,4,2,,1,no,1097,,Business,Budapest to Venice via Munich,December 2017,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The seats were very uncomfortable, new slimline designs which mean less cushion and thin armrests. The airline only allows one checked bag from the US, even on international flights if flying in economy - the economy plus averages about $300 more, so certainly not affordable for most travelers, but if you can afford it, it's 100% worth it for the bigger seats, screens, and extra checked bag. The wifi never worked for me on board my flights.

It's probably been about 20 years since I last flew Lufthansa and it is still as efficient and good as I remember. Prior to boarding, LH sends out a link where you can download magazines for your flight. Even though there was no in-flight entertainment such as movies, this was an innovative way of rectifying this issue. Business class in Europe, apart from Turkish, is generally done with economy seating and the middle one kept free. That is pretty much the standard. This A321 was the newer generation with the new sharklets (winglets) and looked brand new, the seats were good but no better than in Economy. The service was excellent. even though the flight was relatively short, just over an hour, we were served smoked salmon, some meat and a dessert which were all delicious.

The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt. This would involve a 3am start and I would have to pay for a hotel. Was told that this couldn't be done but if I turned up for the flight and checked in the change could be made at check-in. Turned up at 04:00 to be told this isn't possible and I have to phone Lufthansa. Made the call and after an hour and 300 EUR I had the earlier flight. Arrived at Frankfurt and began the delays, 2 hours at the gate, then 4 hours sat on the plane as the de-icer was needed, then it was needed again. So arrived after a 23 hour day still to ensure a 4 hour drive home. So, sent an e-mail and letter to Lufthansa giving them my feedback from my first trip with them, the bad customer service and the great cabin crew. Received a call from the customer service team (located in Manila) with an apology and an offer of 600 EUR compensation. Agreed this and felt that Lufthansa had actually listened to me. 2 hours later receive a call to tell me a mistake has been made and the compensation is only 300 EUR - sorry I say, you made an offer which was accepted and I'm not accepting you changing your mind. They told me they would speak to a manager and call me back. Received an e-mail 20 minutes later to tell me my 'request' for compensation had been rejected and a cheque had been issued for the lower amount. So I called the team and over the next four days received a long line of contradictions - 'The manager will speak to you now, the manager went home whilst you were waiting, we will only talk to a lawyer, we cannot let you speak to a member of Lufthansa, we are a call agency'.

We connected in Frankfurt from a flight coming from Brussels, disembarking this flight we were met by a driver who took us with a Mercedes to the exit nearest to the First Class Terminal. We had to exit the airport and walk about 200 meters; alternatively we could have used a First Class lounge in the airport but we preferred the First Class Terminal. The First Class Terminalwas a good choice as it is just fabulous. I also had sufficient time to take a shower (accompanied with a First Class Terminal duck). About 20 minutes before departure an agent took us to the Mercedes that drove us directly to the plane. With a dedicated elevator we went up close to the first class entrance of the plane. Seating in the nose of the Boeing 747-8i is very spacious and comfortable. The seat converts into a flat bed and you can raise a privacy screen. Soon after takeoff caviar was served which is one of the highlights of a Lufthansa first class flight. Soon some appetizers were served followed by the main course. There were 4 options for the main course; duck (which I’m not fond of), a beef stew (also not my favourite), a vegetarian option (pappardelle) or fish. Since fish was the only option I was attracted to I took it. The fish was ‘loup de mer’, presentation was rather uninspired and the taste was extremely salt. Luckily the cheese and dessert trolley had some very good options and all was served very professionally by the crew which was one of the best and most dedicated I ever had. Champagnes and wines were not the most well renowned names as with some other airlines but the quality was extremely good and typical for the regions/varieties. Just before landing the crew came to say us goodbye personally. We landed on time in MEX and were welcomed by a Lufthansa representative holding a board with our names. The representative took us directly to the diplomatic passport immigration desks. Next we went to the luggage belt where our HON labelled luggage was already standing in front of the belt. This was really amazing; from getting out of the aeroplane to getting out of the airport with our luggage took us only a couple of minutes. This was the fastest I ever went through immigration.

There is a Lufthansa Business class check-in counter inside ""long distance trains"" station at FRA airport. What a great idea! 10 meters after leaving the train from Munich, we instantly dropped our luggage. However we had no friendly welcome at all at counter, neither information about lounge, gate whatsoever. Next passenger please! Neither a smiley welcome at gate, except from a Japanese attendant. Also boarding was slow and lacking information about slight delay. It seems that LH has improved the quality of inflight service but, on the ground, passengers, in any class, always seem to bother attendants. Something has to be done as we faced a similar situation in GIG. Fortunately on board (upper deck), a fabulous moment. Fabulous crew, great food and drinks (except cheap Champagne).

That started to change from 2016 and now I have had another great experience with LH. Flown Hannover - Frankfurt - Miami and back Atlanta - Frankfurt in premium economy class. Short flight HAJ to FRA as usual, in time, small snack, nothing special, but its just 40 mins in the air. FRA-MIA on A380 premium economy. Thats very good value for money. Seats are spacious to all sides, IFE monitor is bigger. Cabin is seperated from economy class. Food is economy class food but served on porcelain. They serve two meals on that flights, both of them have beem surprisingly good. Beverage selection and IFE have been good as well. Staff helpful, friendly and professional. Flight was on time. On the way back from Atlanta it was an A340, cabin was not clearly seperate from eco class, but seats and food have the same comfort as on the A380. Flight was also on time. The only negative thing was that both flights have been heavily overbooked. On the way to US they announce at the gate that every business class traveller which would downgrade to premium economy would get 800 Euro. So far so good, but actually the rate difference was 900 Euro per way (at least what I got offered). On the way back they offered all passengers at check in which volunteer to fly next day 800 USD.

Nice to lie fully flat on a long journey, would not say the seat is greatly comfortable for sleep, if anything a bit hard.

Flying from London to Frankfurt was reasonable though we were very irritated that our seats had been changed. The cabin crew were pleasant. Transiting in Frankfurt was very efficient, with a representative meeting us on the exit of the aircraft and took us to our gate. The queues there were long with first a document check and then general boarding. Not only were we delayed by over 40 minutes but our seats were changed again from row 6 to row 33. To say we were irritated would be an understatement. The flight was extremely full and there was barely space to put our hand luggage. We felt sympathy for the cabin crew as they were clearly exhausted, having to work on Christmas Eve on an evening flight. On our return flight, check-in was super quick but boarding was quite chaotic though relatively speedy in the end. We again had our seats changed but it was to the emergency exit row. We transited at MUC before continuing on to LHR. Nothing pretty remarkable for such a short flight. Overall, Lufthansa do well in terms of seat comfort but the food is quite repetitive. However, they are to be commended for being one of the few airlines to maintain a complimentary onboard service in economy.In addition, whilst the cabin crew are satisfactory, they lack the some hospitality and come across coldly.",Economy Class,4,3,5,,4,yes,1129,A321,Family Leisure,London to Moscow via Frankfurt,December 2017,3,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The points I mention don´t mean much, but in combination they make you wonder why you spent more than the price of an economy class ticket. Outbound flight MUC-ATH (Jan.13th, 2018): I noticed that the Business Class security fast lane at MUC airport was not open. The food in the business lounge at MUC is fine but the same. When boarding the aircraft you used to be addressed by name, not for me. The A321 business cabins have a fixed tray table across the middle seat which is very awkward for sitting down and getting up when you have a window seat. An economy class passenger stowed his hand luggage in the business class overhead compartment. No welcome drink, and announcements in German and English, no Greek.  The onboard choice of meals consisted of two main courses, the one I chose I found inedible. LH always serves freshly baked bread which is nice but for some reason they forgot me so I had to ask for it. After meal, economy class passengers queued to use the business class toilet. Return flight ATH-MUC the lounge at ATH airport nice with  better food than MUC but no toilets. Staff took the trouble to annouce LH departures personally which was a nice touch. At gate, priority boarding was announced but not enforced. This is one of the most annoying problems with LH business class travel and it happens all the time. On the flight, again no announcements in Greek, food markedly better, but disorganised service. They didn´t come around to ask if you wanted any extra drinks after meal service, and some tray tables stayed down into final approach at MUC.

2018-02-03,"""I will not fly with them again""",2,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toulouse to Singapore via Frankfurt. The TLS-FRA flight arrived late, leading to miss the connecting flight to SIN and causing me to spend the night in FRA. These things happen, and as a frequent traveler working in the aerospace industry, I'm more understanding than most. However, I was not impressed at all by the way the situation was handled:  no information was given by the crew about the delay of the TLS-FRA leg. We were just stuck in the aircraft, doors closed, and not moving. After asking multiple times, I was told by the FA it was because of fog in FRA. When I proceeded to claim compensation, the airline told me it was because of French Air Traffic Control Strike. Remembering the chaos in FRA airport that evening, I have a hard time believing that. No staff was available to provide assistance once arrived in FRA airport. All customer service desks were closed, even though it was obvious that there was a big mess in FRA. It was impossible to reach the hotline to check for alternative flights. I stayed online for 2 times 45 mns, before giving up. So I organized my own hotel, transportation and meals, and in line with EU regulation 261/2004, I asked the airline to pay for the expense incurred. It has now been 4 months, and I have yet to receive the funds. I received a reply 6 weeks ago telling me the payment has been made, but it never reached my bank account. Now, customer relations department is just playing dead. On the onboard experience itself, I would say that the crew is professional, but rather cold. Food is edible, but I thought below average of other full service airlines. The major issue lies with FRA airport, where connections are very long: I had to walk 35 mns and take a train to reach the other terminal. Security was very long, with only 2 lines open, and rude staff at every checkpoint (passport control, security, boarding gates). Considering the ticket price, I will not fly with them again, mostly because of FRA airport, and the ""ghost"" customer relations department.

2018-02-17,"""leaves a lot to be desired for""",8,"✅ Trip Verified |  Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",Economy Class,4,5,2,,3,yes,1145,,Business,Frankfurt to Milan,February 2018,2,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

The service was basically an economy service with some enhancements (juice as welcome drink, food was served on china plates, but is the same food as in Economy). The flight attendants were professional as usual on Lufthansa, but the service was nothing exceptional.

Unfortunately the first available flight was on the next day from FRA. Few words to the flight itself. I know flying economy class you can not expect too much. But the seat comfort and entertainment on Lufthansa A380 is in my opinion below average. Seats comparing to other airlines (KLM and Aeromexico) felt very cramped and uncomfortable and touchscreens unresponsive.

Security at JFK T1 is always disorganized, with pre check sometimes available and often not. This time, there was  a dedicated lane, I got to pass with shoes on, but, at x ray, the officer suddenly insisted “there is no precheck” and sent my bag to be prodded, examined and swabbed. LH owns a quarter of T1 and so would seem to have a at least a quarter of the responsibility to sort out the chronic security mess. The lounge was overcrowded and under catered, worn and unchanged. Pre flight dining is now a standard expectation for C class transatlantic flights, but here for a 10.30 pm departure, the offer is a bowl of canned vegetables, sadly wilting on a steam table, next to Teriyaki chicken. There are also some chicken wraps, just about edible. The wines are basic. Pre flight at TXL is even worse. Mobile boarding passes must be exchanged for paper at the desk - no obvious reason; the lounge is outside security, shabby, with a flair of filth. At 4pm, when you might want a bite to catch up on a missed lunch, catering consists of pretzel and potato salad. The security line is long and slow, inspection excessively manual. When you are on the plane, things improve. The A330 on the route has an F cabin but operates C class only, so the front is partly given away to preferred passengers and partly sold to less preferred ones for Euro 450 per leg.

Also, the seat is on a sideways angle, meaning that it's not a natural position in which to sleep in the bed mode, further complicated by the fact that the footwell is very narrow indeed. This is a 2-2-2 configuration and the seats are far too close to each other and lack any real sense of privacy (nor do they have a privacy screen). I do the same sector frequently and this is by far the worst of the major airlines. The cabin looks great but in practical terms (ie the need to sleep), it is very poor. I only wanted a snack for dinner on a midnight departure and chose a Thai prawn appetiser (dry and miserable) and some cheese (dreary but edible) With so many other great business class choices available, it's extremely unlikely I would choose Lufthansa again.",Business Class,1,3,1,,1,no,1157,A380,Solo Leisure,Bangkok to Frankfurt,March 2018,4,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

We waited 25 minutes for boarding and it took us a long time to get all passengers inside the A321, so we left Tel Aviv with about 30 minutes delay. The cabin staff were kind of stressed and unfriendly, due to a group of passengers who stood in the aisle all the time during the flight. Once they announced  there will be a delay at the arrival and they will give further information about connecting flights. The passenger next to me asked how long the delay will probably be but the stewardess did not know. They also announced a gate as arrival position in MUC which doesn't exist. The seats were good, with enough space even for tall passengers, but  only two lavatories for 180 economy passengers? There was no inflight entertainment. Really poor for a four hour flight. The meal was pretty good and rich but we had to wait 1,5 hours to get our first drink and there was no second beverage round as on the outward flight to TLV.

My big disappointment occurred while flying from Frankfurt to Buenos Aires. I asked the stewardess to help me In order to put a backpack in the luggage rack as I was holding my baby and she refused to help me, I had to ask for help from another passenger. I also requested services from the staff and the person assigned to the area pretended not to see or hear the passengers' calls. When I was getting my return flight from Buenos Aires to Tokyo, the flight was canceled and rescheduled, we had to wait around seven hours. Someone from Lufthansa staff in Buenos Aires did not want to inform us about the arrival times to our destination. I was assigned a second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo with only one hour difference, I was not informed that I would travel with another airline and they did not confirm whether I would be given seats with a crib for my baby (I had paid for this seat as flying from Buenos Aires to Tokyo can easily take more than 30 hours). I asked the staff to confirm this information, but she told me that everything was indicated on the ticket, which was not the case since it did not indicate the local time of arrival to Tokyo, so I had to request the information from another staff. Finally, the flight took off later than the scheduled time expected so I was afraid that I could not connect flights on time. In Frankfurt, you can experience some delay while making flight connections. No one from the airline assisted us even though we had less than forty minutes to get to the second flight, due to the flight delay. Luckily, some security from the airport gave us a priority in the security line because otherwise we would not have arrived on time.

We loved the quiet atmosphere in the well booked business class compartment - our daughter had two seats on her own to take a nap almost throughout the entire flight.

Their online customer services logging system should reply within ""five days"" but my enquiry about the delay and also my follow-up complaint have only been acknowledged but have never been responded to, despite my weekly emailed prompts to them.

2018-05-09,"""a comfortable and plush flight""",8,"✅ Trip Verified | Night departure from Munich to Singapore with Lufthansa. Boarding was efficient and uncomplicated, arrived in cabin. Cabin crew introduced herself to me (bad sign) and kindly forewarned me that as I was in seat 1C, there would be a bassinet in front of me, and offered me a choice of seat change. Eventually was in Seat 7D. The A350-900 version 1 by LH has 2 business class cabins, the one most fore is a self-enclosed area bounded by the toilets and galley in the rear, but this area has bassinet fixing positions. The second area is aft of the toilets and galley and separated by a partition from the premium economy section, this area has less seats but you are more likely to be bothered by toilet and galley noise, if that is important. This area does not have bassinet fixing positions. The modern seat was as efficient and high-tech as before, really simple to adjust your seat to achieve a variety of positions including lie flat. Service was more friendly this time, though also with a Germanic reserve (none the worse for that!). Dinner was served shortly after departure, and was pleasant enough fare. Overall cabin ambience was good enough to achieve a fairly comfortable sleep, and awoke for breakfast - which was really not deserving of the term, it was the first time I ever managed not to eat scrambled eggs and cheese at 40,000 feet! The only other slight criticism is that the toilets were quite heavily used in business class and were showing signs of definite disorder by the time we were approaching our destination.

The flight attendant serving our part of the cabin was efficient, proactive, and friendly. The dinner served was elaborate and delicious. The veal and asparagus would have presented a challenge if we had been using plastic cutlery, but silverware did the job handily. I remember feeling that the seat was somewhat narrow in the flat-bed configuration, but I promptly dozed off and slept soundly for five hours. I must have been mistaken about the seat. With all the horror stories about lost luggage published here on Skytrax, I was apprehensive about my suitcase double connecting in Newark and Munich, but Lufthansa (and United) did their job and my case arrived promptly and intact. I had made a special request of Lufthansa by mail ahead of the flight. All correspondence was handled courteously and professionally. Many reviewers here tell bitter tales of frustration dealing with the customer service departments of other airlines, but I could not be more pleased with how LH handled my request. I have read a number of comments questioning whether Lufthansa deserves to be on the Skytrax 5 star list.

This was not a pleasure as the flight take 2 hours and 30 minutes and I had some pain at the lower back area and thigs. I guess for a shorter flight the seat is ok, but for flight of more than 2 hours it can be very unconfotable to sit on such a seat. The menu/food was ok, the tast more bland than nice. I expect more from a 5 star airline, especaially in business class! There was only one choise of coffee, filter coffee. No further coffees available like espresso or cappuccino other airlines offer in business class and same typ of aircraft, single aisle. And the service has been done with foof and beverages trollies, this is fine but at some shorter flights within Europe Lufthansa has a signature service.

The seats were very comfy, WI-FI was fast, food was good, and the staff was very friendly. Boarding started on time and in the correct order. Boarding went very smooth, and as soon as I boarded, I was welcomed to the purser. The food was great and seat very comfortable. I slept great and enjoyed my meals. Lufthansa’s staff is outstanding. A man sitting next to me was very inpatient and kept complain about the fact that the person behind him got his meal first even though he had a higher status. I would have already stopped serving, but the crew kept smiling and putting up with his moaning. My flight was great and I would definitely recommend it. After I landed in Frankfurt, I had a 4 hour layover until my connection to Zurich, but it went great and very smooth. As I was very tired, I headed to the lounge to rest, but after the lounge staff saw I was almost sleeping in my seat, they offered me a bedroom with a shower. The bed was perfect and the room looked like a 4-star hotel. The shower was outstanding and I was impressed with the service. After my rest, I headed to my connecting flight to Zurich. This flight also went very smooth and the food was great.

2018-06-12,"""turned out to be a nightmare""",1,"✅ Trip Verified | This is my 3rd bad experience with Lufthansa in the last 3 months and I think I need to share it. I was travelling Business Class from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then to London with a layover in FRA of 1hr 45min. Boarding at ZAG was done without priority boarding. When landing at FRA the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. Not only no separate bus was used for C class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. When I reached Terminal A I had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates B where my flight for LHR was departing from. I have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within Europe, yet Lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. The queue for the security was one of the longest I have ever seen in my life. As a business class passenger and Star Alliance Gold member I attempted to enter the Fast Track. A lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""No"", despite me showing her my C class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. I asked her three times whether Lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""No"". I waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. When I reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. The Lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. There are not a lot of benefits for business class European flights. People pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that Lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. What should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. I have experienced inconsistent and bad service from Lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that I would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.",Business Class,3,2,3,,1,no,1211,CRJ1000 / A320,Business,Zagreb to London via Frankfurt,June 2018,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Lufthansa has their Istanbul airport office and I get some service counter agent who basically has to call and hold just like I did from hotel. Another 20 minutes to be told to change the Istanbul segment would be $2,400! If I were to purchase a business class ticket today from Istanbul to Frankfurt it is $350? So why $2,400?

Unfortunately flying it in economy is just awful. I was seated in row 16, the first row of a mini cabin between club and premium economy, where seats are sold at premium prices. The seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong, not a chance to get comfortable. IFE could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could, so gave up on that. The insult after injury was the main meal: a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo! The German kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. Tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why?

We went to counter. There was long queue. It was approximately 20 flights canceled, due to bad weather. So after 1.5 hour in the queue we have reached counter. Staff was quite rude, they told us to go to another counter in departure area. We went there. There was several times longer queue. Here we spent approximately 5 hours prior to reaching counter. Here staff was more friendly. They put us on waiting list for 8 a.m. flight and give vouchers to hotel. Next morning we have repeated exercise. In boarding area they told us that it is 40 people on waiting list and only two seats, so we have to go back to counter. I ask, is it possible to talk with manager. Answer was quite rude: go to counter and there will be your manager. We run to counter. This time we reach it in 40 minutes.

There I realized that we may reach Florence by some miracle this evening, otherwise we may not get there even till our train to Verona.

Another hour waiting and we are again in front of window. They told us that here we can only cancel flight, but to start procedure of returning money I have to go to site and feel up some request. They told us that we may get our luggage in half an hour to one hour. Of cause, it took us 2.5 hours to get it. Mean while I feel up that form. It was not from the first attempt that I was able to submit it. To summarize our experience: of cause there could be different circumstances, like weather conditions, strike etc., but it would be good attitude to send manager to each canceled flight area and talk with passengers, figure out their needs, try to find some solutions. Nothing of this was done. In addition to that normal companies did not canceling flights due to temporary weather conditions, just postponing it.

Transfer in Munich was straightforward as it was well-signposted to the train to transfer between different terminals. Munich to Hong Kong was my first time on an A380. I was excited to experience a new airplane so I booked a seat on the upper deck. Unfortunately the seat I booked was in a row of three behind a row of four so that when sitting I faced the gap between the two seats in front of me and had to sit at an angle in the seat to view my entertainment screen. Otherwise though the flight was very good. We were served dinner shortly after take-off, breakfast in the morning and a snack before landing. The food was all decent airline food.

When I purchased the ticket, there were flights with either about 45 minute connection time or about 3.5 hour connection time at Munich / Frankfurt airport. 3.5 hour seemed quite long so I chose connecting flights with 45 minute layover. If Lufthansa sells the tickets, the transfer should be possible. In fact, I had less than 30 minutes to transfer as the boarding for the 2nd flight closed 15 minutes prior to the departure. When my first flight arrived in Munich, I had to run. But there were so many people in the queue to go through the security and then passport control. It would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate! But then I realised from the live departure board that my flight to London has departed. As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me. There was a hotel at the airport, Lufthansa should have arranged a room for me there. They should not sell connecting flights with such unrealistic layover time. I tried to complain to Lufthansa, however, their website didn't allow me to do so. So I emailed their customer service. They acknowledged the receipt but I haven't heard from them since then.

2018-06-28,"""customer service is the worst""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. One of the worst customer service you will experience. Myself and my 15 month old daughter are traveling from Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. When we reached the airport, they checked in the bag and when they checked the passport, they found that my wife cannot travel as there is a new rule that if you have a layover in Frankfurt, we need a valid schengen visa or a US stamped visa. We told Lufthansa that you never told us anything while booking the tickets or even when i called them to pay for the seat allotment as Lufthansa charges person for getting the bassinet seat (Most other airlines provide it free if you book the flight with infant). Lufthansa just want to get the money from you and never provide any information. The person at the check in counter said it is in our website and i asked him to show it, he went and wandered for 15 minutes and said he lost the sheet which had that information. I checked their website and nothing says about the rule. They mention that if you have two layover within Europe you need schengen visa, but not for a single layover within Frankfurt. And the person in the counter said, if you have booked the ticket through Lufthansa, the customer service should provide me alternate route. So, i called the customer service as i booked the flight through Lufthansa.com. When i called Lufthansa customer service, they told me that they cannot do anything apart from cancelling (which i dont get any refund) or postpone the flight to some other day so that i can go and get schengen visa. I am speaking to them saying getting schengen visa takes days and my wife and daughter has to travel within couple of days. The customer service person said they cannot do anything. So, i went back to the check in counter and the person over there called the supervisor who made a call to customer service of Lufthansa and explained the situation. Lufthansa finally said they can put us in another flight with a huge layover everywhere and also it cost us $1500 more as it is considered as one way flight and we need to pay from our pocket. I have been going through all this mess in the airport and took almost 4 hours with the 15 month old baby sitting in the airport. I decided not to fly with Lufthansa as they treated really really bad and went to Qatar Airways and flew with them, who provided excellent care for the baby and myself. But Lufthansa didnt stop there, they charged me extra for missing the flight and also charged me more as my return flight is with Lufthansa. So, i ended by paying more than $3500 for the entire flight from Detroit to Chennai and my return flight. The person in the check in counter said, they see same scenario everyday (at least 2 people every day). Lufthansa is  making free money from 2 people at just one airport and i am imagining how much money they make from all the airport around the world. They charge people when they knew that they cannot fly and also charge them more whey they miss the flight due to Lufthansa mistake. While booking the ticket, why cannot Lufthansa mention this. Lufthansa mention that you need to have a valid schengen visa is there is multiple layover within Europe. If you can say that, why cannot Lufthansa say that if you don't have a valid US visa or a Schengen visa you cannot have a layover in Frankfurt. Lufthansa just want to get the money out of you and don't care about their customer.

2018-06-28,"""Worst A380 layout I have flown""",4,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt. Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrée selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival.

They gave me a tiny thin blanket and I had to sleep on the cold metal chair which was the only object to sleep at the whole time and had to try to be awake for half of the time to keep my eyes on my baggage, so no one can steal any of my stuff. Its obviously not true that the airport doesn't have any room for passengers who their flight get canceled. I was so frustrated and I had to be at work the next day but what Ive got instead was a very poor customer service reps and no one was around who could be responsible or at least give some solutions!

We were not proactively offered anything (drink, etc) on flight ATH-MUC, the curtain between Business and Economy was left open for most of the flight, with the result that the Business class lavatory was used by people from Economy. None of the cabin crew tried to stop them. Surely one of the benefits of flying a Business class cabin is to have a dedicated bathroom? The boarding process was chaotic - any notion of priority boarding was a joke. On 1 flight by the time we boarded, other passengers had filled the storage space. Since we were seated at seats 2D and 2F, where we had no option but to store everything in the overhead lockers, I believe that someone should have made sure that people on the other rows stored things under the middle (empty) seats. To his credit, the steward very kindly helped us find a solution - no pre-flight drinks were offered, on one flight no menus were offered. We were offered a choice of ""meat"" or ""paella"".

While Miles&More Senators/HON and Lufthansa Business Class customers are allowed to use the DB Lounge at Cologne Central Station, this service is not provided to Star Alliance Gold customers. Still, I find the 50-minutes train ride from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt a very convenient alternative compared to flying. What I do not like is that there are no check-in agents at Cologne Station anymore – they have been replaced by a check-in machine. So it is not possible to make changes to the ticket: No change of flights, seats, frequent traveller card or APIS when flying to the US. Security at Frankfurt was very quick and I went directly to the lounge closest to my departure gate in the A terminal (A30). It was a business class lounge and had a really good selection of food and I nice tarmac view. It even had showers (which I did not use). I found it better that the Senator Lounges.

The way back through Munich was a mess. For whatever reason we couldn't check in online. We called and were told we could check in at the airport the next morning at the airport to get our boarding passes, then do the same again once we were in Munich. This went OK for the first short flight, but horrible for the connection. The Lufthansa service desk in Munich wouldn't print our passes and sent us to the gate without alerting anyone. Lufthansa has an extra security check-in before the gate, and those employees didn't want to let us through without a boarding pass. This resulted in about twenty minutes of additional delay with three other confused Lufthansa employees. We finally made it to the gate where we were then reprimanded by another Lufthansa employee for being late for boarding. She refused to sit my husband and I together (?), so we were placed in separate aisles. Once on board the flight, the seat I had been given was in between a woman and her two children.

Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options – vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times.

Even though the level of Singapore Airlines or Emirates is not reached yet but the Lufthansa crew kept taking care of the passengers the whole flight.

At the Frankfurt hub, the transfer waited for us at the gate, giving it somewhat of a delay, maybe 20 min's or so. The organisation of the hub was average, but the FRA airport is really large, so we had to run several kilometres from the arrival gate to the departure one. There didn't seem to be much organisation either, with gates lying far apart although the nearer gates were vacant. Overall I had a good experience though, even counting the delay. There were Wi-fi, but one had to pay for it, in three different levels of WiFi speed and amount, ranging from approximately 3€ up to 7€. Because I didn't buy the WiFi services, I can't rate them, but there were more than sufficient information on the subject.",Economy Class,4,5,3,,3,yes,1241,A320-200,Business,Göteborg to Prague via Frankfurt,July 2018,2,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Cabin crew friendly and helpful. These B747 aircraft are showing their age, and one problem is that the overhead bins in the first few rows are smaller than standard and don't fit the cabin baggage size limitations of LH. Food and presentation were ok. Seat was reasonably comfortable but entertainment system was lacking in choice and quality. A big problem this flight were 2 small children whose parents were not controlling well. They squealed, shouted and cried throughout the 8 hour flight and other passengers were quite upset.

I'm sorry to report that not only have the standards in flight service dropped, there no variety of snack foods in the galley between meals. Last time there were apples, chocolate bars, crisps and biscuits. And the food during mealtime (I have low fat meals) was less. SQ seats (due to the lower leg support and the foam in the seat itself) is in my opinion more comfy. And the noise cancelling headphones in SQ make a difference. The crew was friendly, personable and efficient. They were just let down by what LH was supplying. The DUS-FRA flight was cancelled via email/sms 5hours prior. Upon arriving at DUS to see what alternatives were available as nothing had yet been listed in the LH App and LH disconnected my attempted phone call 5 times whilst in waiting queue, they were most apologetic and had our complimentary replacement ICE High Speed train tickets to Frankfurt printed out and ready to go, along with a time table, within 10mins, which was much appreciated. The LH only check-in located directly upstairs from the FRA airport train station was also handy.

The original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes, which is more than enough. However, the boarding time was delayed twice as I was waiting in Basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. So I asked the front desk what should I do in order to catch my second plane, and she  couldn't give a useful answer, saying you should be able to catch it. As I got on board, I asked the crew several times about whether there is a fast track for transfer and whether they have further information about my second device. All the feedback I got was ""I couldn't give any information"" and ""sorry we don't have the device to check"". By the time I get off the plane, I still have five minutes to catch up. However, I have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. This is simply no way for me to speed up. I ran  but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. So I have to go to the service center for the rebook. But the queue is super long. They only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people.  And the officials didn't even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. This isn't my first experience of a tight transfer so I do have some example to compare. I remember when I took a Swiss airline from Beijing to Zurich, the plane was late due to frost for two hours. However, during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew. And as soon as I arrived at the Zurich airport, there are officials guiding us how to go and the transfer was really fast. Eventually everyone was happy about it.

After a delayed flight from Sofia to Frankfurt, I missed my connection back to Florence which in and of itself would not be a problem if I did not have another flight the very next day from Rome to Bangkok, ironically connecting in Frankfurt again. The flight was not on the same booking as I had taken a last minute trip to Bulgaria and felt comfortable giving myself one day in Florence before my flight back to Bangkok. What would have been a few busy days of traveling quickly turned into a nightmare. After a long walk to terminal B to the transfer counter, which I could not find and was not clearly marked, me and hundreds of other frustrated and tired customers got in line. Standing there I realized that I could potentially miss my return flight to Bangkok the next day because of a one hour delay; my best laid plans were ruined. As I inched forward slowly to the front of the line, I could see the agitated groups of people huffing and puffing about their misfortune. I started to feel a tinge of panic too. Standing in the very front I looked at the flashing number and approached the counter. I was greeted with a welcoming smile and cheerful voice. Already an amazing feat as far as I was concerned seeing the amount of verbal abuse that was going on at the counters while I was waiting. This immediately put me more at ease. I explained my predicament: If the earliest flight from Frankfurt to Florence landed at 9:30, I would not get home to get my other bag and drop off the keys to my friend's apartment until at least 10:30, it's a 30 minute walk to the train station and a taxi is not much quicker then I would have to hope there was a train right away. If my some twist of fate I got an 11:15 train, I'd be at Rome central station at 12:45 and then have to hope again there was a coinciding train to the airport just at that moment which would get me there around 1:30pm for a 2:55pm flight and that is if absolutely everything went my way carrying two pieces of luggage in the hot August sun. Maybe some daredevils think that is plenty of time but I'm a traveler that arrives 3 hours early for every flight. Just thinking about that time frame was causing me stress. The friendly woman behind the counter listened and empathized with a smile. She could have just told me that even though both flights were with Lufthansa because they were on different bookings that there was nothing she could do. She could have politely told me that the 8:30am flight was the best she could do or brushed off my concerns and turned her attention to the hundreds of people behind me.

2018-08-18,"""requesting compensation""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  . I booked to fly with Lufthansa from London to Zagreb via Frankfurt on a Wednesday evening. The check-in staff told me that the first flight was delayed so I would miss the connection. The impression was this was very much my problem and I should speak to the reservations line. Reservations changed me to a flight via Vienna to stay the night in a hotel courtesy of the airline and fly to Zagreb early the next day. I was satisfied with this. I asked the check-in staff whether I should get the hotel voucher from them or from Vienna airport - they were clear that I should collect this from the Austrian Airlines representative at Vienna airport. On arrival at Vienna I was told by the Austrian Airlines representative that Lufthansa had put no information on their system relating to my needing accommodation for the night. They spent 20 minutes trying to contact Lufthansa reservations and were not able to - on speaking to a representative at the Frankfurt Lufthansa headquarters the Austrian Airlines rep was told ""that's not my responsibility"". There was a pop concert on in Vienna - there were no rooms or only rooms with inflated prices available and I could not afford the cost of a taxi to/from the city and a hotel myself. I approached two hotels in walking distance who told me they had rooms only accessible with a voucher. Austrian Airlines would not provide me with a voucher without Lufthansa indicating on their system that this was agreed. The rep apologised for the experience I was having due to Lufthansa but was  unable to act without their ticking a box on the system.  I spent the night on the floor of the airport.  I emailed Lufthansa that night expressing my frustration and requesting compensation. I have heard nothing back over a week later and just spent 25 minutes waiting on their customer services line without getting through to a representative.

We had a very short layover in Frankfurt and our flight from Lyon to Frankfurt was delayed. The pilot announced several times that the flights from Frankfurt were also delayed and not to worry. Nevertheless, we ran as quickly as possible to make our connection to Philadelphia. The gate agents practically laughed at us and said that flight was long gone. The truth was we arrived at our gate at 1:45pm, the flight was delayed until 2:10pm (according to an email I received from Lufthansa) and did not actually take off until 2:30pm (according to FlightAware). Yet, Lufthansa did nothing to get us on that plane (I assume it was out on the tarmac - the busing around the Frankfurt airport to and from the planes is ridiculous). Instead, we had to go to customer service and were re-booked on a flight the following day. Customer service actually seemed annoyed that they had to deal with us. Then to make matters worse, the customer service rep said they would book us at a nice hotel in center city so we could see Frankfurt. The hotel was no where near center city - we were in some warehouse district that was not walking distance to anything. To get to center city was a walk and two bus rides away or a 40 euro round trip taxi ride. Ridiculous! The extra 24 hours in Frankfurt was awful and I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was seriously the most money I have ever spent on an airline ticket ($1900+ per person) and the worst experience I ever had.

The inflight entertainment system on the trans-Atlantic flights had a decent selection of movies and music, but my screen kept freezing and crashing, and had to be reset, on both long-haul flights. The food on the EWR-FRA segment was okay, but the chicken meal on the FRA-EWR flight was absolutely horrible. Decent bar service on both long-hauls though. The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful. I just barely made it to the gate a few minutes before they closed the doors. My already short connection was made even shorter due to the fact that the flight from Vienna landed what seemed like several miles from the actual terminal, and we were then treated to a 15-minute bus tour of Frankfurt airport, so I ended up literally having to run all the way to my next gate. Overall, I'd still fly LH again, they're still better than any USA-based airline, as well as better than many European ones, but as a supposed 5-star carrier, they really need to improve the food on long-haul flights, work out the glitches in the entertainment system, and take better care of passengers' luggage.",Economy Class,3,4,3,3,3,yes,1286,Boeing 747-800,Solo Leisure,Newark to Kiev Boryspil/Vienna via Frankfurt,August 2018,2,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Upon arrival at the airport in Luxembourg, I had to find out, that Lufthansa has decided to use Air Nostrum aircraft as wet lease on this routing for a couple of months already, without ever feeling the need to inform customers of the change of service. Air Nostrum is a substandard low cost airline, normally operating on behalf of Iberia. Not even a Star Alliance partner. There was zero service onboard. Flight attendants were rude. They basically disappeared out of sight immediately after takeoff, only to be seen again for final landing procedures. This is in no way what I expected upon buying a Lufthansa flight.

Lots of space, away from galleys and far enough from lavatories. Two things that are inconvenient - the aircraft is extremely noisy and the noise cancelling headphones, attached to seats in Business Class are very bulky and impossible to sleep in. Ear plugs don't help with the noise. I've done this route three times in the past year, and I always choose 8A on MUC - YVR leg. Service is impeccable, food could be hit and miss, entertainment is great and the aircraft is not good, but that's what Lufthansa flies on this route, hence I don't have much choice.

I asked if the luggage had to be picked up in Beijing and re-boarded to CKG, I did not receive conclusive information in Hanover and at the boarding gate in Munich. The lady at the boarding gate in Munich has looked in the PC, but she was not able to give a conclusive answer. She just gave the advice to ask in Beijing! On my objection that I do not speak Chinese, she said that at the jetway when leaving the plane there are always someone with English language skills. That was not the case. Then, as a precaution, I waited for my suitcase on the luggage belt, which then came. The food of the flight section MUC-PEK can be classified as problematic. The first leg of the return flight, which I took with my wife, was done by Air China. The first leg was delayed by 1:40 hours due to fog in CKG. We had to fear for our connection in Shanghai, because an airport change from Shanghai Hongqiao to Pudong (around 60 km) was necessary. When we made our online booking only a terminal change was indicated for Shanghai. Later it was changed in an airport change. Air China was unable to obtain any assistance because of the delay. Then there was an altercation at the check-in CKG because of the number of luggage (2 pieces each 23 kg per person). Air China wanted to carry only 1 piece with 20 kg/person. Furthermore, it was forgotten to enter the passport number on my wife's boarding pass, as soon as the next trouble occurred at the security checkpoint.

2018-11-26,"""isn't worth the money we spent""",7,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Munich. First time my son and I decided to try flying in Premium Economy as we were flying with Lufthansa. In short, it isn't worth the money we spent. It was more comfortable than flying in Economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. Differences between Economy and PE are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of Economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. The kit has 'Cerruti 1861' on it not Lufthansa and was just okay. They serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which I think should be varied. The drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. British Airways and Air France serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. The service was fine. We had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. Food was tasty. However, there are just two choices: Meat dish or pasta. And the portions are as small as a frozen meal. Everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. Bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. The flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. However, the choices were either crackers, Lindt chocolates, and juices and water. Seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. I found it problematic to recline. In fact, I could not figure out how to do so. And the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. If I weren't sitting next to my son I'd need to ask my seat mate if I could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. Worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire PE section and they were filthy. Plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. In fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. Sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. Also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. I've flown British Airways and Air France which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. This was a connecting flight between Munich and Rome. Hated that we were not told that upon arrival in Rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. It was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. Would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. All in all, I'd have to think hard if I want to spend another $2K for Lufthansa's PE in future. I just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in Economy. In fact, they make it known that you're really in Economy as you have no special boarding privileges either; you enter with all of the Economy passengers.",Premium Economy,3,4,2,3,2,yes,1336,A380-800,Family Leisure,San Francisco to Munich,November 2018,2,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

However, I was forced to buy a ticket for 50 euros, non refundable for nothing!

After a layover in Frankfurt we finally arrived in Belgrade. Of course, our luggage did not arrive as initially confirmed. We talked to airport staff and expressed our concern as our wedding attire was in the luggage and we were having our ceremony the following weekend. After dealing with airport staff we were sent home and told we would be contacted when our luggage arrived. Three days later we were told our bags had showed up but due to customs we would have to drive the 3 hours back to Belgrade to retrieve them. After another day of our trip lost and a few hundred dollars in gas, tolls, and customs fees, we finally had our clothes. When we returned to the US we filed a claim for the hardship and money lost due to their delays. We have been going back and forth for a couple months now with an endless string of emails requesting that we submit more and more documents and receipts and whatnot.

There was no food provided on the flights from Berlin to Munich, and Munich to Frankfurt. To make matters worse, the service was horrendous.

Budapest departure delayed. Thus missed connecting LH MUC-DEN flight. Rebooked LH MUC-ORD-DEN. 2-hour wait. Boarded LH MUC-DEN. Told we had to wait at gate for people arriving from Greece. LH MUC-ORD departure thus delayed nearly 2 hours. Long time to sit on the plane. Thus, missed UA ORD-DEN connecton. At LH service desk in ORD, discovered my wife had been booked by MUC LH on LH ORD-LAX, not ORD-DEN. LH ORD told us only choice was to take AA flight next morning to DEN. As that was the only choice that LH offered, we accepted. LH put us up in a distant rather basic hotel. Arrived at AA (Terminal 3) early next morning to check in. Long line. Denied boarding. AA said LH incorrectly booked our AA tickets. We have to go to LH in Terminal 1 to sort it out. Thus missed AA flight. Arrived at LH in Terminal 1 and told they would not open for 8 hours. Went to UA, they tried to help. There was a UA flight at 8.45 to DEN. Why didnt LH book us on that instead of AA. UA called LH to get OK to write the ticket (Hey, Star Alliance, right?). LH agrees but disconnected before transaction completed. UA agent calls again. Starts to tell story, disconnect. Calls again, starts to tell story, disconnect. Finally he is able to tell the story and again request OK to issue ticket. LH says: NO! No? Yes, no. You have to go back to AA (Terminal 3) and ask AA to reissue the ticket to UA. But, wait, there is no valid AA ticket. That is the problem. In any event, if we go back to AA, we will miss the UA flight. So I buy the tickets, and I will ask LH to reimburse. UA prints out receipt and says surely LH will reimburse. After all, if the LH agent in ORD had been paying attention, he would have issued a ticket on UA and not AA in the first place. However, now, LH says no refund. Not even for goodwill. We have received off letters from LH about this. LH says the wait for passengers in MUC, the misbooking of my wife to LAX instead if DEN, the failure by the LH agent in ORD to find to the UA connection to DEN, and the improperly issued AA tickets in ORD were all due to bad weather in Europe. It took us 42 hours to get to DEN. I will try to avoid using LH in the future. The ground staff was incompetent and uncaring.

After many frustrating calls to your 866 number and talking to someone who English was not understandable, we retired for the evening and called again the next day and finally spoke to someone who helped with confirming our flight and my sister was then able to check-in online. I have no idea what my cellphone fee will be for the call, but this could have been avoided if the error was not made it the first place and when you hirer someone ensure that they speak perfectly clear English. In the future, I will avoid booking any flights with Lufthansa.

The food choice was poor and poorly presented, the wine list consists of two reds and two whites, both very average.

There is no privacy between the seats and the comfort of the cushion was a really bad surprise, not what I was expecting from a business class seat. The service on board is in line with the expectation, really friendly and regardful. Wi-Fi service costs extra money, even with a business class ticket or for members of Miles&More which is disappointing. starting with 7 EUR just for the slow connection and going up to 29 EUR for the premium one.

The trainee at the counter forgot to give us fast track cards for security/immigration which was quite a pain as it was a very busy night at BKK so we had to go back to check-in to collect cards. Security/immigration was quick and efficient. Boarding started on time and was very quick. Blanket and pillow was waiting at the seat and amenity kits were handed out shortly after, as were welcome drinks. Orders from bar were taken prior to take off but dinner orders were only taken after the seat belt sign had been turned off. Despite this dinner was completed in just 90 min after take off. The food was ok but nothing special. The seat, while lacking privacy and not being all aisle access, have to be the most comfortable seats I have ever been in. Whether sitting up, lying down or picking the ""relax"" position the seat was great. The entertainment system was great and easy to use with a good selection of movies and tv shows. Breakfast served prior to landing while ok was perhaps the least tasty meal of this trip. The intention was good but the whole dish had ended up being very dry and boring. The crew were quite non-descriptive as they were going through the motions and while not unfriendly they did not seem to engage at all, a very forgettable crew. Landing in FRA was on time.

2019-02-19,"""boarding was a total mess""",5,"✅ Trip Verified | Miami to Munich. How Lufthansa is a 5 star airline has always baffled me but this time I really got the confirmation. I will not blame them for the 3 hours we spent on the plane before departing on our outwards trip (MUC-MIA), there was heavy snowfall in Munchen and we had to wait for the runways to be cleared and the plane to be deiced. However, during those 3 hours there was no service at all. I wasn't expecting much, but a glass of water would have been nice though. Now, the A380s cabin is seriously outdated. And even though it's clear that the plane we flew on recently underwent a C-check, being repainted in the new livery, the didn't bother retrofitting the cabin, so you get a 10 year old in-flight entertainment system. The touch screen barely works, it's slow to respond and responds only to every 3rd of 4th command. And on the inbound leg (MIA-MUC) the control keys (volume, channel, reading lights) didn't work at all. The IFE also froze and reset several times. On the outbound flight some passengers had the IFE not working at all and although they announced on the PA systems that they reset it several times, it didn't solve the problem. We also landed with the cabin light on (they should have been turned down) due to the same electrical problem. The seats are quite uncomfortable and the pitch in economy is just bearable and there are large metal containers protruding in the leg area. I have flown on low cost airlines which had the same seat pitch. There were no amenity kits provided, which if I'm not mistaken, should be provided by a 5 star airline, even in economy (I have flown on ones that do). The food is also nothing to brag about, it's half decent but certainly expected more from such a prestigious airline. On our backward trip the crew arrived late (but again, not their fault since there was an accident and a traffic jam), however the boarding process was a total mess. People aligned according to their seat numbers, but then they decided to randomly close lanes and just board people wherever. There wasn't even a boarding announcement, just for first and business class. When they started boarding Economy and Economy Premium they just opened two random lanes. This meant that no one really knew what's going on and the random boarding made the boarding time unnecessarily long for such a large plane (people in the back which should have been first ended up waiting for people in the front to sit down, who should have been boarded last). The crew however is pleasant, smiles and does a good job. The pilots also seemed professional and seemed to have everything under control, despite quite rough turbulence at times. At least this time our bags arrived safe, this is a miracle for Lufthansa since they managed to break 2 trolleys on my previous flights. In conclusion, definitely not a 5 star airline and regret choosing them over the other 5 star airline with which I could have flown (despite the fact that my flight time to MIA would have been an hour longer since they operate from a different hub and would have had other connecting flights).",Economy Class,3,5,2,1,1,no,1381,A380-800,Couple Leisure,Miami to Munich,February 2019,2,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Once in the plane, an A319-100, the welcome was really German and polite from the cabin crew. The seats were nice, actually comfortable with a small but good place also for the legs. As it was just a short, 1h 20 minutes flight of course they passed with some sandwiches and beverages, but they offered you how many beverages you wanted and as I was really hungry I asked the hostess if they had some sandwiches left and after literally two minutes with no hesitation she brought me two sandwiches, with a big smile in the face!

But I was on Premium Economy for the long haul part from Frankfurt to Bahrain, and was offered an upgrade to Business Class for the short haul sectors for a very low fee, which I took. And I was not disappointed. On boarding, I was greeted with a smile. The flight attendants were professional but not necessarily engaging, although they did address me by my name. No hot towel, welcome drink or IFE. But the food was excellent in both directions, considering it's an hours flight. Outbound was a tasty cereal with fruits and on return, a delicious tuna salad with hot bread and premium brand bar service, with refills. I really enjoyed these flights and was impressed with the good service. The seats, though hardly any leg room, surprisingly felt comfortable too. Both flights were on time. But I still would avoid paying Business Class fares on European routes. Checking prices (two days prior to departure), I noticed that the BC flight LHR-Frankfurt-LHR was only little cheaper than the fare from LHR-Bahrain-LHR on Premium Economy!

Soon after take off, a bar service was offered, followed by lunch, which was OK, and a snack just before landing. On my return flight, a tasty sandwich was served and later a hot breakfast. The scrambled eggs with Tandoori breast of chicken on top seemed a rather odd combination, and was rather bland. The seat back touch screen IFE monitor was easy to operate and had a limited selection of movies, both old and new. The crew although polite and professional were non-engaging, despite there were only eight passengers in the PE cabin. As for the seat itself, a few inches of recline, foot rest and adjustable head rest made the journey very comfortable for the 6 hour flight to Riyadh for a 45 minute stop and onto Bahrain.

The touchscreen often registers your tap in a different location. Food: The food quality is ok but below the standard of other airlines. It is obvious that Lufthansa is trying to cut some costs. For example my meal included a salad that only had the leaf in it, no tomato or other vegetables that usually belong in a salad. For my chicken I thought they served me tofu because it was just some white cubes of something dumped into some sauce without even bothering to mix them together. Lastly for breakfast I was served the main dish, a yogurt an a roll. That is alright but I would have wished for some fruit to be served along with it like other airlines do.

Lufthansa (And Frankfurt airport) in general is a great airline to fly, with good planes, well maintained, great staff, clean, courteous, and efficient operations. The challenge is their digital experience.  For an airline this large, I am shocked at how bad their web sites and APPS are. The speed is so slow that I feel I am back in the days of dial-up service. They seem to have layered so many pages on top of one another, that when you click on a button, you wait 10 to 15 seconds for the next page to load. Then, when you think you have it loaded, some other layer loads on top, and moves the screen so you have to search for what you were just doing.

I then tried the APP - couldn't eventually book it in the APP because I kept getting kicked out.

There was a lot of chaos and people who could run were running, but people with disabilities or problems had to go through a lot of stress to reach to the aircraft. Lufthansa needs to work on this where the problem is at their end because their connecting flight was late.

As this is a long flight we choose the airplane (wanted newer aircraft for more comfort) and to pay for a premium economy seat to have extra leg room and to be able to choose a window and isle seat so as to have no one next to each other. At the time the reservation and seat bookings were confirmed. 4 months later we noticed on the Lufthansa app that the following changes were made to our reservation without any notification - Our seats had been changed between Bangkok and Munich. (different seats allocated than booked).Our flight time has been bought forward almost 1 hour, aircraft type has been changed (New A350 to old A340 200). The aircraft operator has been changed (from Lufthansa to Sun Express) We then called Lufthansa to ask what and below is the response. First call we are told the flight had been moved to a different airline and we should contact them directly (Sun Express) and that Lufthansa cannot help us any further despite us booking directly with Lufthansa.  2nd call were told that this is a Lufthansa flight but this plane is not listed on there website as an aircraft used. The operator then said it was a different operator and I asked if there are any alternatives. The operator booked us on a later flight same day this time with Lufthansa. However despite asking if we can have similar seats and being told they are available (we were told we could book these afterwards on line) we then see a window and isle seat are not available. 3rd call we are told a window and isle seat is not available and to write a written complaint. At this point we are told this has been caused by a maintenance issue with the original aircraft and other people have also been affected. 4th call (as we still do not have the confirmed booking we paid for) we called again and we are told we can have a window seat but when looking at our confirmation we get allocated 14D and 14E but on the seat map this is a isle and middle seat, not a window seat. 5th call we are once again told our seats can be moved to a window and isle seat and have now been allocated 14A and 14C however when looking at the details on line we understand this may not be a window.

We were booked on a different flight to Washington DC and then switching to another airline on to Dallas. To add insult to injury we had to pay to get seats together, only available in economy plus.

The check-in was ok (this time the BUD 2A terminal was totally empty, nobody was at the LH business check-in desk), the fast track security was ok, but the next step, the lounge was not ok. LH uses the Celebi Platinum Lounge at BUD, and the standard is around middle! Food selection is poor, quality is bad, there is no warm food at all, snack and sweet selection is pretty bad too, so I'd say this looks like rather a premium economy level lounge. I don't know if Celebi or LH upgrades or checks this lounge, but it would need a definite upgrade, cause for the business class ticket price, it was a disappointment. The boarding was ok both at BUD and MUC. On board, it is also a bit strange. The seat is not a business seat, it is an economy seat, only the middle seat left empty, but this is the only good thing one can say about LH's biz class seat. No bigger legroom, no bigger recline comparing to economy. The food is ok, there is no warm food, not even for a MUC-OSL route. The dessert was fine though (in fact it was better than the main course), and the tea was served in a ceramic cup. Bread was ok, butter was ok, though there was no hot towel. The pursers on both routes were kind and helpful. The Lufthansa business lounge in MUC was super, that one would have to be copy-pasted to BUD! And of course, it was nice to have the possibility to check-in two baggage (which this time I did) and to go on board with two handbags (which this time I did). All-in-all, nice flights with minor delay in the first leg, professional and efficient crew.

2019-06-11,"""should express empathy""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Hong Kong via Frankfurt. At the check in at London I was told if I knew that the flight from London to Frankfurt was delayed. Then asked if I am going to miss my next flight? They said no news at the moment yet so you might still make it. We landed around 2145 in Frankfurt although boarding for my next flight was 2125 (flight at 2210). When I got off the plane I expected there to be ground crew guiding people with connecting flights. But there was none whatsoever and we had to take an airport bus to the terminal. Once we arrived at the terminal no staff to guide us again. We had to run towards our next flight to catch the flight. Once we arrived at the gate for the next flight it was 2221, the guy said was it is closed. I explained I have been delayed by the flight from London. He said you have to exit and get someone to book your hotel and next flight. So we had to walk to the exit again. Once we got outside we were booked a hotel and next flight. We had to wait outside the airport for the shuttle to hotels. It took us 20 mins for the wait. Again no clear instruction which is the right bus. I am not saying it was any of the ground staff's fault as well but I think as a service industry the first thing an employee that represents the whole airline should do is to express empathy. Also the whole process would be made much smoother if only the airline could arrange 1 person at the arrival to say we are not going to make our next flight and it is closed or if we should make a run. It doesn't make sense for us to run all the way to the next gate to be given the cold shoulders.

Seats were ok but with one of the worse legroom, I have experienced (IFE box was also under the seat). Toilets, on the other hand, were super clean throughout the flight.

As Lufthansa only operates one flight at night, baggage drop-off is only available 3-4h prior to departure, unfortunately. The Lufthansa Lounge in Dubai is rather small but offers a good selection of food and self-service alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. We had already eaten at the Ahlan Lounge before thanks to our Priority Pass and have to admit, that Ahlan Lounge has the better offering. But as soon as we were on board, we were glad to have chosen Lufthansa again! The service was just outstanding and ground staff made sure we were reseated next to each other (it was not possible during online check-in). We were offered drinks immediately and were shown the menu with food for later. As this flight was only a bit over 6h, Lufthansa was serving a light midnight snack and breakfast. Both dishes were really good and were met by a good selection of drinks. The seats in Business Class are full-flat on the A330 and offered a comfortable night sleep. It's not the biggest business class seats available, but definitely comfortable! In the morning we woke up relaxed and left the plane after a refreshing breakfast.

Lufthansa prides themselves to deliver what is called Signature Service in Business Class which means that every Business Class passenger gets assigned a personal flight assistant who is supposed to introduce her/himself to you after boarding. Ours did nothing of that sort. When I asked her, her response was a counter-question whether I would be missing something. Great service attitude indeed. We have been sitting in row 15 on the A380 (upper deck) which is separated by sort of a curtain from rows 10-14 despite all rows are supposed to be Business Class. As a consequence, we were entitled to watch how passengers in rows 10-14 were looked after by their personal flight attendants while we didn't get anything. We felt like being in sort of a second class of Business Class. I don't know whether this is common on LH flights on the A380 but it is unacceptable.  When the service finally started, we found out that other passengers got offered a salad between the started and the main course while we again heard nothing about it. Probably, it would have been too much of a nuisance to our flight assistant to serve us a salad. When the main course finally was saved, it has been the worst meal I ever had in 25+ years of travel.

As I had not checked in a bag, I wanted to just get my new boarding pass from the LH transfer desk within the security area. We were told that we would need to see a representative outside security. Passed immigration, got in the queue for check-in. As I was walking up to the counter when it was my turn, I received a message on my phone saying I had been rebooked and could access my new boarding pass through the app. Proceeded to proper checkin nonetheless - rebooked on a flight nearly four hours later than my original flight. Check-in staff received me saying that I might as well have got my boarding pass from the transfer desk colleagues behind security. Told her all of us were told we had to head up to this checkin and she responded that that information is incorrect. I was then handed a four pound voucher for food and drink.

Firstly at the start of my trip, I almost missed my flight to Denmark from Frankfurt as my flight from Heathrow (Lufthansa) was delayed which made me have to run through the airport to catch the last bus to my flight (I must also add that I have asthma and needed to constantly use my inhaler during the process of running to catch my flight. On my return from Denmark to London I experienced yet another delayed flight except this time it was from Denmark to Frankfurt. By the time we were meant to be boarding the plane, it had only just landed. Once we touched down in Frankfurt it was already time to board my next flight to Heathrow. Other flights had a minibus to take them directly to their next flight, however, Heathrow did not. The gate for Heathrow was announced once we landed which we were told it was B41, this was a gate change from the initial gate which was B20. Once we had finally got off the bus, I and a few others had rushed out following the correct signage. I eventually made it to B41 which I was then told that the gate has moved to B47 which I then had to rush off to. I think that this is extremely unacceptable as this is now the second occurrence in the space of 4 days, and I am sure that this didn’t just happen on the 2 days that I experienced it, this is a continuous occurrence and something needs to be done to eliminate or even minimize this issue.

So, I booked my own hotel, returned next day and I was number 9 on the waitlist. All flights were full, and I was told to go to the customer service center, again a three hour wait with virtually no staff and many people. I feel sorry for the staff as they need more. As I was only going for a short time I gave up and was put on a wait list to return home. Luckily 24 hours later I got a flight home.

My recent experience of a simple one-stop trip from Vienna to Manchester and intended direct return (on Austrian) is a case in point. VIE-FRA. Flight delayed. Once boarded it was announced that there was no catering and limited drinks available due to a catering strike. No compensation, no voucher, no air miles. Frankfurt Airport is a heaving, dark disaster, having to lug luggage and navigate miles of travellators. FRA-MAN. Delayed by over an hour. Again, no catering and no alcohol. MAN-VIE. OS464 14/7. Waiting at the Gate, no staff, boarding time passes, then 15 minutes after our scheduled departure the screen goes blank and people start to panic. A dnata ground staff shows up, casually announcing the flight is cancelled, we have to exit the airport, recollect luggage and return to the check-in desks to be rebooked. 120+ passengers all scramble to arrivals, we haul our 4 items and stroller with a sleeping infant as fast as possible back to check-in where we are told there are no seats available until the following day. So we are rebooked with Swiss. MAN-ZRH-VIE. Two hours before departure I recieve an SMS that our flight is 1h45mins late. We've been rebooked! Via Frankfurt. God no. We pack and walk over to the terminal and are rebooked via Munich. MAN-MUC-VIE. Finally, an on-time departure to Munich. The flight again affected by the ongoing catering strike. By this point, I just don't care. A rude stewardess initially refuses to provide us with a napkin when we are feeding our infant, responding ""you can get it from the toilet"", before thrusting paper hand towels at us. MUC-VIE on Austrian is again delayed by an hour after a discrepancy between the manifest and number of passengers on board (how does this happen?)! We finally land in Vienna 21.5 hours late. Add to the above the fact that Manchester Airport T1 is a total disaster, with understaffed security at the Assistance Lane we were forced to use, overzealous security staff, far too many shops and too little gate space and seating, a children's play area consisting of little more than a soft mat etc. Incidentally, inflight WIFI was available on all flights, but no moving map or inflight information which is a shame.

Firstly, to allow for traffic, we arrived earlier than the 3 hour window at EWR. Lufthansa would not let us check our bags until 5pm, so we had to wait 45 minutes even though there was no long lines at check-in. The announcements at the gate were not clearly spoken or loud enough compared to Icelandair which was right next to our gate. You could clearly hear their directions, but Lufthansa’s, barely. The staff were not as courteous as expected and seemed upset. We were late departing and when we arrived in Munich, our gate was occupied by another plane causing us to be further delayed in reaching our connecting flight. Since Air Dolomitit is part of Lufthansa, there should have been communication to hold the plane for us! Or at the very least, there should have been a representative meeting us at the gate and walking us to customer service to rebook our group of 22 on the next flight. Instead we panic stricken raced dangerously through this unfamiliar airport and then customs only to be told at the gate the plane had already left (if this was true, they actually left earlier than the departure time). We got to the gate at 11.11, no fault of ours. Then only a few of our group were given lunch vouchers and to make matters worse, our new flight departing at 2.25 for Florence was delayed.

After standing, waiting with no update, the people in the front were told the flight was being delayed. We finally left at 1:40. All passengers with connecting flights were stressed. The stewardesses reassured us that our flights would be held for us.  Then we were told they were short staffed, so only minimal beverages would be provided with a bag of pretzels. The crew were friendly and did their best. We finally land in Munich with previous scenario in mind that we would miss our flight, but a representative met us and raced us through the airport to the plane.

Our experience started on the way back when I tried to check in online. I couldn't do it as booking code I got by email was not applicable for Turkish airlines. When I contacted via FB Turkish Airlines I was asked to contact travel agency and get another booking code. Second proposal was to call international customer line. Not working processes should be airlines responsibility and customer service shouldn’t send me back and force but should take responsibility and manage by them self. After few hours communication in FB we decided to check in the airport before flight. Early check-in was important to us because we wanted to get seats on the first row to be able to leave plane ASAP to catch another flight because we had 50 min between flights. So we were proactive and wanted to do the best. In the airport representative of Turkish airlines was surprised that FB client support were not able to check-in and told us that customer service people can see another booking number which was needed to check in (clients are not able to see). I am not angry that situations like this happens, I am angry that nobody from Turkish Airlines wants to listen customer experience and move even one finger to improve they processes and client service. And day by day everything goes worst. Instead of asking to share feedback and send to responsible people to take a look what is wrong everyone is shaking heads. So my try to share my experience in Istanbul airport was unsuccessful. At least I was able to check in and we got seats in the 8 row. But luggage was sent instead of Poznan to Munich. Probably she had already feeling that we will not reach Poznan tonight? Lucky we saw that on time and we asked them to redirect our luggage to Poznan. And for sure the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Munich was later then planned. We asked flight attendants if they can contact people on the gate and ask to wait. We asked passengers in the plane to let us go first to be faster. When we reached the bus to go to another terminal we asked bus driver if he would be able to contact gate and ask to wait 5 min (because we had to wait 5 min for bus schedule). Answer was no we cant so we had to wait. When reached Terminal number 2 we ran as crazy (maybe somebody could explain me why?). And I came to the gate 6 min late, and plane was still there.

On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team. I was for instance able to get off the plane before almost all premium passengers. In conclusion, not Lufthansa's finest day, by far. Would I fly them again?

I have chosen this airline for many years as a family friendly airline and for its reputation. Unfortunately when I traveled this time it was a total disaster leading me to write this review. I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference.

Hardly time to visit the toilet and certainly not opportunity to go into the Lounge. At the boarding gate I asked about my luggage and I was reassured by the staff, after checking the computer, that it had been transferred successfully to the second plane. After boarding the plane, lunch time, we were informed that there was no catering service at all due to the recurrent issue that they have had .. for over 2 months now. But being served just a wafer is totally unacceptable, they didn't make even the effort to get us a sandwich despite departing from their main hub. Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid. I had to beg then for having it express delivered on that night (only Senators and HON members are entitled to such privilege) despite being Star Alliance Gold and Lufthansa Frequent Flyer. Fortunately the staff took pity of me and they managed to get it approved by Lufthansa. Needless to say that I sent the feedback form to customer services on the very same night. I requested for someone to call me as soon as possible.

Now, before I took this flight with my dog I made sure the flight will be the most comfortable as possible for her. The rules are that dogs can fly in cabin as long as they are secured in their carrier during take off and landing and when the seatbelt light goes off the dog is allowed to sit in your lap. I asked the rules several times before traveling because she hates being in a carrier and goes crazy barking and crying. I even got her tranquilizers from the vet just for her to be able to deal with those few minutes she has to be in the carrier. This is the way we traveled to Europe a few weeks ago. Nice and smooth she made it thru.  Lufthansa banned me from flying their airline because my dog, who came out of her carrier by poking her head out, mid flight and was barking! This pilot demanded At the beginning of the flight to keep her in the carrier the whole flight and told me that that is the rules. My poor dog hates being in the carrier, I probably would’ve not brought her if that was really the rule because she barks and cries when she’s in the carrier. I asked the pilot why he would not use his own discretion with his rules, for my dog will make the whole plane crazy by barking while being locked in a small box. It’s the rules.  I did what he told me anyway and my dog barked for 25 minutes straight while I apologized to the other passengers. So we landed in Frankfurt to catch our connecting flight to Miami and the stewardess told me that we cannot board the plane. Mind you that flight to and from the US, ESA’s are allowed to sit on your lap the entire flight, landing, taking off and all. I was not able to board my flight in Frankfurt and was told to order another plane ticket with another airline, and that I will not be getting a refund or will they transfer my ticket to another airline.

LH appears to be losing its discipline when it comes to on time boarding and departures. On board, the hard product offered decent space for one’s belongings but the fact that not every seat has direct aisle access remains a downside for LH business class. The seat offers limited privacy and the fact that it is angled towards the neighbour, makes it quite awkward in the fully flat position as a mere 1 inch divider separates the respective foot wells. The seat was narrow compared to business class seats found on other carriers. It was not particularly comfortable in the lie flat position. The service was in typical LH fashion, efficient but lacking warmth. The food and wine offerings were quite good however, the salad consisted of limp mesclun greens and was sort of thrown onto the tray. The snack served prior to landing was actually better tasting than the lunch offering consisting of a delicious soup and very tasty prawns. The IFE had a good selection and I especially enjoyed the cameras showing the exterior of the aircraft. The toilets were kept in immaculate condition throughout the flight.

When in seating mode, there was not enough space for my arm and I kept hitting my neighbour with my elbow. There is no storage space to put things into. All my stuff ended up on the floor by the window.  The flight was full and perhaps because of that the service was not good, either. The cabin attendants looked harrased and did not smile, it was difficult to to get a drink as they were busy with a full cabin. Despite bad service, the food was good.

2019-10-10,"""Senator Lounge is in free fall""",6,"✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt on 6 October in Business Class. The Senator Lounge in Berlin is in free fall. There was a lot of talk about the new Senator Lounge. In the end, the new one is worse than the old one. The choice of food and drinks is very limited. For breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. The croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. There is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. Shame on Lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the German capital. The departure from Berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. However, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. As I was in a good position overlooking the apron, I knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in Frankfurt. The aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. In Business Class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. For me, there was enough connecting time in Frankfurt, as I knew exactly how I could get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 quickly. I spent some 20 minutes in the Senator Lounge. It was quite empty for that time of day. The food served reflected the fact that the Oktoberfest in Munich had started. It was all very Bavarian – the same you get in the Munich lounges all year round. Within the 50 minutes I was in Frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from B30 to B20 to B27 and finally to B28. The flight from Frankfurt to Tivat was the real disappointment. The flight was more than twice as long as the inner-German flight from Berlin to Frankfurt, but the food served on board to Tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. I mean how is this possible? How can it be that Lufthansa – a so-called 5-star airline – offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? Frankfurt is Lufthansa‘s main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. Is that the impression Lufthansa tries to leave? Austrian, a Lufthansa-group member, is able to serve a hot meal on all international flights no matter how long it is. Why is the parent company, Lufthansa, not able (or willing?) to do the same?",Business Class,3,4,3,,3,yes,1551,A320/A319,Couple Leisure,Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt,October 2019,3,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

When we arrived at the check in they said they had overbooked and if we could volunteer to go on another flight (KLM) leaving at the same time. I figured no harm so I ran to the other side of the airport only to be told by KLM that we had not been booked on that flight and that the gate was closed. So we had to run back all the way to Lufthansa to then be told they could get us on our original flight. In form of “compensation” they offered us €250 each and put us up in a hotel with a shuttle bus from the airport. But like the previous promise of another flight, the shuttle was non existent so we ended up paying for taxis out of pocket. Next day when we arrived early to follow the given instructions about the compensation once again, no one knew anything and everything they told us was wrong. The only thing we could do was file a claim online. Of course this is a very convenient way of not dealing with customers. I called and was told if I wanted to make a reservation of course I could talk to someone, but if I have a complaint that can only be done online, nice way of avoiding responsibility and not facing your many unhappy passengers. We filed the claims, I sent all the required emails and have received no reply. I am very frustrated with what I consider to be lies and lack of responsibility.

After only 2.5hrs of a 9.5 hour flight the cabin lights were turned off completely. This was not a red eye flight so I have no idea why this was done. When I got up to stretch and stand I was told within 2 minutes to go and sit down by the rudest stewardess I have ever encountered. She also badgered other passengers throughout the flight. There was also no safety briefing at the start of the flight and all the announcements were so garbled you couldn’t understand what they were saying, in German or English. There was no offer of assistance while de-planing and no offer of assistance in regards to where we go next for our next flight. Once we arrived in Frankfurt we were almost run over (literally) by a golf cart doing at least 15-20mph! We had to walk almost 2km to get to out next gate and when we went to the Lufthansa service desk for directions there was no one around (of course).

Over an hour after landing, we had missed our flight. The girl on the customer service desk arranged for us to get our luggage back and  gave us a cursory apology for any inconvenience. Missing your bus is an inconvenience, but this has required us to alter our car hire, the friends meeting us in Dallas have had to hire another car, hotels for them and us at both ends of the journey, and we’ve missed the start of our tour.

On my return flight, which was late night, the service started with drinks and a delicious beef sandwich. 90 minutes before arrival a bland breakfast was served consisting of omelet and cold items. The seating on Premium Economy is very comfortable (2x3x2). The usual water bottle and small amenity kit was also provided. But as I was at a window seat, stepping out to use the toilet was difficult, especially as the passenger in the front seat had his seat reclining.

As it was a midday flight, a cold lunch/snack and warm bread was served, along with drinks. Comfort wise, there is no difference between Economy and Business seats.

IFE okay. Of course seat width, pitch and hardness were awful. Love the plane, hate the configuration. No info pre-landing about connections or ground personnel to facilitate what became a tight connection due to delayed arrival. Return to Orlando, possible same aircraft. Problem this time was logistics of transfer in Frankfurt. Inbound flight from AMS late and then gate hold issue. Close connection quickly became a crisis. Ironically, I had hurt my back during trip so requested assistance in transfer. None was present on arrival in Frankfurt. Ground agent said gate change had messed up meeting. Arrived Terminal 1 gate 29, outbound Concourse Z gate 69 with 20 minutes to connect! Ground agent scolded me for making too tight connection. I said LH booked it that way, I am just the customer. Finally contract ground service arrived and two women loaded me into wheelchair and sprinted me through concourse, Passport Control, through tunnel, up elevator and then onto electric cart for high speed ride to Gate Z 69 which was at least a mile downrange, still. Made it just in time. If I had not had excellent help from ground personnel, would have definitely missed the one daily flight to Orlando.

I received an Email confirmation with my flight to Belgium with Brussels airlines and proceeding with an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna. I wanted to check- in online but on Brussels airlines it was not possible, but for the flight with AUA yes. I was a bit concerned, but I thought due to the strike this could have been normal. I arrived a bit earlier to the airport and at the check-in counter by giving them my documents their answer was “we don´t have any flight booked under your name” I was very furious as it was looking like there would have not been any solution to fly back on that day.

Frankfurt airport is operating out of just the one terminal: Terminal 1. This means that the terminal was cram-packed full of people. There was only one restaurant open and it was expensive and the quality of the food was pretty poor.  The flight to Bilbao was approx. 2 hours, and during this flight they only gave out one bottle of water per person - all in the claim that it is because of COVID-19. The following morning, I received an email from Lufthansa - apologising that there have been changes made to my booking and asking me to either accept the new conditions, or choose not to and keep the flight open. The problem was that there was no alternative flight option shown. Lufthansa cancelled my return flight and didn't give me the option of rescheduling my return flight on 24th July. I went online and entered my booking details into their site and only my outbound flight was showing up. My ticket had been changed to a one-way ticket. I tried calling their customer service number but after multiple attempts - they just don't pick up - I gave up. I also sent them a couple of messages, using their contact form, but again, no response.

2020-08-01,"""had not understood the forms""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  After paying for selected seats I saw the seat numbers had changed, one from row 6 was now row 23. Only after numerous attempts did I get through to Lufthansa only to be cut off in the middle of my call. I tried to call 4 or 5 more times to simply be cut off before anyone answered the call. I then tried using the Miles and More member number, I got through after just a few minutes and was helped by a courteous friendly assistant who, after 5 minutes, re-allocated the original seats. At no time did Lufthansa inform me of this change or of the fact they had seated two people on the same booking some 15 rows apart. I wrote an email to Lufthansa on 29.06 asking for an explanation on 23.07 received an automated replay that did not address my question. The seat numbers continued to change in the days leading up to the flight at least the changes were in the same area. 48 hours before the flight the screen showed that the seats ""could not be pre-booked on this leg of the journey¨ but could be selected at time of check-in? In line with an apparent Lufhansa ""Covid19 code of conduct"" during this whole seat reservation farce the seat next to a booked seat was shown as ""non-bookable"" .. an intelligent and logical move, a positive Lufthansa initiative. However on boarding the plane (after ground staff informing us the pre-booked boarding assistance was ready! I had no requested this and after a brief discussion the whole thing was dismissed with indifference and lack to interest on their part. Upon boarding to my surprise people I saw that in fact passengers were sitting in the ""non-bookable seats"" .. no Covid19 distancing as implied by Lufthansa. In addition to being incompetent during the booking and boarding process they were also lying about their ""responsible seating policy"", Additionally boarding was more chaotic than normal, people queuing in the aisles, moving from the back to the front of the plane: evidence of the Lufthansa “dynamic seating process”. During the flight the FAs handed out 3 documents in a disorganized and giggly fashion, requesting us to complete them. The request was in unclear/garbled English and German. When unable to fill out 1 form (as none of the options applied to me) I asked the FA how to proceed: she replied “I don’t know, I´m just a FA, just fill in something!”  One form was handed back to the FA, the other 2 had to be handed to the French authorities at passport control/security at Lyon arrivals. There were no officials at Lyon arrivals, no passport or security controls. One document was only valid for nationals from non-EU countries (plus UK, Norway.) The FA clearly had not understood the forms she was handing out. On the return flight I received a “Boarding Gate change” on my phone, the new gate being quoted as G26. As I was unable to find any “G” gates I asked a security guard where the G area was (no ground staff were at the original boarding area). We were then called to board (at the original gate) only to be kept standing for 15 min while the confused and theatrical ground staff gave us unclear and contradictory information. We we bused to the plane (overfull bus). I saw 2 “low-cost"" airlines using airbridges.

Stop saying it will take 2 weeks when that just isn't true. I was going to submit a chargeback December 1, 2020 if I did not receive my refund by then.

I was assigned a seat number and given boarding cards for the 1st flight LH0453 (LAX to MUC) as well as for the 2nd flight LH1754 (MUC to ATH). I was told my suitcase will go straight to Athens and arriving in Munich I had only to go to the gate and with the given boarding card to get the plane to Athens. The flight LH0453 arrived in Munich about 3 hours before the 2nd flight. In about 30 minutes I was in front of the gate for my 2nd flight to Athens. To my surprise, 20 minutes before the departure, the Lufthansa person stopped me and did not allow me to get to the plane. I was told that I needed to have the PLF form from the Greek authorities. At the check-in in LAX nobody told me anything neither before when a few days earlier I had called Luftansa. Instead, they had assured me beeing a US and Greek citizen I did not need anything else. This time, 20 minutes before the departure of my flight to Athens, I was not allowed to enter the plane and I had to stay in Munich until I fill the PLF form. Although they had given me boarding card in LAX, they forced me to stay in Munich airport without any assistance  and they refused to put me in a new flight the next day with the excuse that my ticket was a United Airline ticket and not Lufthansa. This is the worst experience I have come across. The Lufthansa people in Munich did everything not to give me any assistance and to ignore me. They did not want to help me finding a hotel around the airport nor another flight next day, they did not even want to give me my suitcase that was already on the plane to Athens.

My surprise came when on both flights (inbound and outbound) I had to pay the full airport fee for extra baggage over the check-in desk. Seems they had an error in their system and that the transactions did not go through and they did not inform me. The personnel at the airport asked me to claim for a refund on the difference between the online and the airport fees, so I did. After I explained my case, Lufthansa recognized that it was their fault but they would not give me my money back. I insisted to talk to a supervisor and I was denied to do so.

What a mistake ! Our return flight from Crete to Brussels on the 19th November was cancelled and the proposal we received by e-mail was a flight from Athens to Brussels. When I called their customer support the first proposal was a flight on November 30 (11 days later) leaving 6:55 in the morning and arriving 20:50 in the evening. There were flights available leaving 6:55 arriving 10:50 several times a week but we could not be booked on those because we did not have the right booking class. I was asked to call again later, maybe other options would become available. The next time I called the proposal was even better: we would leave on the 29th and arrive on the 30th (a stay in a hotel was not included). I could contact customer relations if I did not like this, which I did. The only answer I got from them was that their customer services were able to handle this problem. After calling 5 or 6 times they finally arranged a flight for us: on the 1st December. At least that was what I understood because when I received the e-mail it said the 5th. When I tried to get this changed I was told that I would have to pay because I confirmed their alternative. When they were calculating the cost they ended the call so I gave up and booked a flight with another airline and got home without problems. Off course I did not want to throw away the money I spent on the Lufthansa ticket so I tried to rebook it for next year. Again a huge mistake. If the flight was booked as a return flight on their website it would cost only €8 more than my original ticket, but as a single ticket it would cost € 150 more.

I had planned and packed carefully knowing I’m a woman going to a conservative, patriarchal country. Doesn’t matter, Lufthansa left our luggage in Frankfurt. I didn’t think too much of it to begin with because half of the time I travel international they lose my luggage. But normally they get it to us the following day or the day after at the latest. If we didn’t have 5 multilingual, wonderfully kind guides from our tour company constantly harassing Lufthansa and the airport carriers, I don’t think we’d ever see our luggage again. At first they told us to come in 2 days later before we flew from Cairo to Aswan and they’d have it for us to take with us (since they have the same flight coming in every day). It never was put on the plane. Then they tell us it will be sent to us in Aswan. We’re there for 2-3 days so they have time to get it to us before we get on our Nile Cruise. They never tried to send it to Aswan. Now we just heard we won’t get our luggage until we go back to the Cairo airport and retrieve it in person. Why? Because they honestly don’t care. They don’t think it’s their problem that we don’t have our luggage. Reminder that we’re not just in a foreign country, but in Egypt. We have a body guard assigned to us from the Egyptian government to escort us whenever we leave our hotels. “Go buy some essentials and we’ll refund you 50% of the cost.” First off, even refunding me 100% of the cost is not enough to even begin to cover this inconvenience. There’s clothes, snacks, and other items in my luggage that I bought specifically for this trip that I’ve now bought in vain because I will never use them.  I saved up money, which is precious right now during the pandemic, to come here and enjoy myself! If my luggage was delivered to me in a timely fashion, I wouldn’t have been able to relax and enjoy myself rather than almost have a breakdown.

Lufthansa has to do much, much better if they really are committed to protecting their customers (and their employees!). I know it is difficult for the crew to control everything that goes on during a flight, but to be blunt, it is their responsibility and they failed their costumers who followed the rules (doing everything to avoid infecting and getting infected) miserably.

I chose Lufthansa for a number of reasons, mainly reputation, route, price, and recommendations by others. I must say I was extremely disappointed. Terrible infotainment system - slow and clunky. Terrible economy seats - they recline but the seat pad does not move forward like others airlines such as Emirates, Turkish, Ethiopian, etc. Many rude flight attendants. Unsurprising given most are German, but still, should be more pleasant. No meal choices. Every other airline I have ever flown has offered at least some food choice ~ meat, chicken, fish, etc. Not Lufthansa! It was pasta with tomato sauce and wasn't even tasty. I sent emails to the Lufthansa customer relations department. Here is the context of my email. We traveled from Frankfurt to Johannesburg on flight LH572, departing on June 3 at 22.05, which lasted approximately 10 ½ hours. During this time, we experienced disrespect, rudeness, and overall unpleasant attitudes and service by some of your flight attendants. We were seated in row 32, seats G, H and K. I understand that food is limited, however, when we inquired if our daughter could have an alternate meal, the female flight attendant blurted out “Everyone has the same thing! If you wanted a special meal, you should have requested it before the flight.” That’s fine, but the insensitive and rude behavior of this flight attendant was not acceptable, by any culture! When the plane pulled into the gate at Johannesburg, the fasten seat belt sign was turned off. I stood up to stretch my legs as I am tall and my knees hurt. Again, this flight attendant shouted at me to “sit down until you are told to get up!” Is this the type of behavior that is tolerated by your airline? Based on reactions from other passengers on this flight, I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect, almost disdain, by some of your flight attendants, as I was not the only passenger she yelled at.

The day before the flight on July 24th, I went online to do my check in and just want to make sure everything is okay then I noticed Lufthansa had cancelled my flight without booking me another flight back to the US, meanwhile, I paid for round trip. So I spent last day of my vacation 4 hours on the phone trying to solve this issue. First, it’s so hard to find a valid number to call Lufthansa for customer service. When we finally found a number to call, then it says they only work Monday to Friday. Long story short, I finally was able to rebook my flight for July 25th at 9.10AM. Boarding is so slow and inefficient. We were supposed to leave at 9.10AM but we did not leave until 9.40AM due to slow boarding. I originally paid/ booked premium economy seat, while they rebook me they downgrade my seat to regular economy. Then I have a connection flight from frankfurter to JFK at 11.00AM. While in the air I asked a crew member that I have connection flight if I can still make it and she said yes, if I ran. I ran through the immigration and I asked the guy who worked at the immigration again if he thinks I can make it then he told me he doesn’t think so because of the gate is very far, the farthest gate it’ll take me about 10+ mins if I run (Z68). When I finally ran to the gate, airline employees told me the boarding has closed. I missed my flight while my other fellow American who ran with me said while they were told this connection flight will wait for us. Then we were told there is no more flight out to NY JFK anymore for the day. We can either wait until tomorrow or go to Newark NJ. (But my car is parked at JFK long term parking). Then we have to go to another gate (Z12) to the counter in order to rebook our flight. Anyway, so I took that flight at 1:20PM (again they put me in regular economy while I paid for premium economy). Because of the whole chaos that Lufthansa put me through now I end up in Newark. So I have to figure out an Uber home or arrange pick up by friends while I have my own car parked at JFK where I booked my final destination to.

Breakfast prior to landing was a sandwich. Flight attendants very efficient. The 747-8 provided a very smooth flight albeit with some minor turbulence over the Atlantic. This aircraft had the old familiar livery of LH which I actually prefer to their new livery. Landing was smooth, deplaning very interesting.

Second, my bag did not arrive in my final destination. Strange considering I had one connection in Frankfurt of several hours, which is where Lufthansa's automated system says the bag was held up. I filed a report with the local baggage service at Bari airport, but customer service directly with Lufthansa has been poor/nonexistent. I have not been able to reach anyone on Lufthansa by phone in Germany or the US. The calling service offers no way to leave your phone number for a call back.

I had to buy a new ticket due to this but all flights to Milan were sold out so I chose to fly direct to Rome and then to Belgrade (which I did). On the way back (Aug 1) I caught my flight from Belgrade (FL# LH1411) at 6:00am. The flight was 30 minutes taking off and we were airborne at 6:33am to Belgrade. My connecting flight in Belgrade was also on Lufthansa to Milan. The flight landed at 7:50am, my connecting flight (LH 248) was departing at 9:00am. The Frankfurt airport was crazy busy with very long lines. After deboarding the plane, I ran with computer back and check in luggage in tow to find the connecting gate. The first passport control (8 minutes away) line had about 4 windows open with about 30 people in each line. I asked one of the staff that I have a flight leaving very soon and I will miss it, is there anyway I can get to the front of the line, she said you have to wait. I waited about 10-15 minutes and the line hardly moved. I then went up to the airline staff window and pleaded with the man there that I would miss my plane. He looked at my boarding pass, stamped me and let me through (thank you!). I then ran about 5 minutes more to a send security passport check to get to the connecting gate. I waited in line for about 5 minutes and then was allowed through. I ran to my gate and arrived at 8:50am. I handed the lady at the gate desk my boarding pass and she simply said.. ""The plane has left"".  I asked her how the plane could leave early when they  have a manifest that shows there is a passenger on this plane connecting from a flight from Belgrade. She simply looked at me and said ""I'm sorry the plane is gone"". She then handed me a card that had a Lufthansa website address on it to lodge my complaint. (I have since lodged a complaint, to which Lufthansa replied that they have ""no fault in this"" - Unbelievable!) My question is: How can they simply just leave knowing there is a connecting passenger coming from another flight, and why would they leave 9-10 early!?

Moreover, if there is a government-imposed travel ban, they will not allow you to have refund (only rebooking, usually at a very high price because the last-minute booking is usually twice or three times the price of the original ticket). Other flight companies allow for refund, but Lufthansa is instructing their call service to deny the refunds and rebooking cannot be done online. To rebook, you need to call their call service, which is a nightmare. I tried to rebook 3 times. First time I was on hold for about an hour.

2021-09-17,"""My daughter was denied boarding""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  My daughter was denied boarding.  The adventure began already in the night before the flight when I tried to check-in my daughter electronically. This was not successful, because electronic check-in of LH asks whether or not a visa is available. In an exchange program, there is no visa, however, but an ""application approval"" and the visa is issued at the local airport upon arrival. Such a possibility is, unfortunately, not available within the electronic check-in at LH and electronic check-in could, therefore, not be performed. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. As soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. However, only an electronic check-in was possible there. This check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. Therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. After a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. Although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. When she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. Despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines I have experience with close their gates just before departure, LH refused to accept my daughter. Lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also LH has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. Not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of LH. All in all, I consider this procedure unacceptable. Two days before departure, I wanted to clarify one more point with LH and called LH's information desk at 23:00. According to the information on LH´s website, the support line is open until midnight. The announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. Since the clarification was important to me, I decided to wait.

The queue was endless and moving in the slowest possible pace. Things looked quite scary, so I opted to go directly to business class check in with my Turkish frequent flyer card (unsure whether eligible for that). After some 25 min of wait (at business class line folks) I was checked in and given tags for my carry-on.  Boarding was a mess. Calling passengers by groups (to lessen physical contact I guess) gate agents then asked everyone to form a standing queue near the gate door within a small space providing close physical contact. Then the gate door opened, so people were able to board, and without airline staff guidance things got back to normal. Onboard it was ok. The seat back recline has been eliminated since new A320NEO came to fleet, so seat comfort is now not on par with low cost carriers. A bottle of water and wet napkins were handed out. We took off and landed on time. Disembarkation in Munich also went by groups. It slowed things down, but not badly. Then boarding flight to Kyiv was another stupid quest. Without any announcement all the passengers were re-directed to another gate. There instead of boarding we had to get our boarding passes stamped. But with stamped boarding passes instead of boarding the plane we were diverted to the initial gate where they were trying to enforce boarding by groups ignoring the fact that stamping passports was not done by groups, so they were finally able to form quite a big disorganized crowd. Boarding took forever and some more covid infection was spread in this interesting way. Onboard it was uneventful.

In-Flight Service : Very friendly and accommodating as Lufthansa has been in the past. Seat-Comfort - Due to the half empty flight, I was happily able to stretch out. However, even in a full flight, the seat would have been above average by economy standards. I can recommend the mini-economy cabin in front of economy plus on this particular plane. Food/Beverages - Good selection of beverages. Meals were fine (Ravioli for dinner and a sandwich box for breakfast), but nothing special by economy standards. No choice food alternative choice was provided. Entertainment - A bit of a more dated touch system, that was a bit sticky to navigate, but overall a good selection.

Living close to their German hub, I use this airline for world-wide travels, both for business and private needs. In the past, the airline delivered not perfect but pretty good services as on the ground as well in the air. The last 5 years the situation has changed drastically. I had multiple serious issues on the ground and in the flight, when Lufthansa staff demonstrated a full ignorance or arrogance to the passengers. The numerous complains to the support line result in formal response without any real measures. The COVID pandemics worsened this disaster service even to more catastrophic. I could provide my personal tens of examples how the Lufthansa employees treat the customers in bad manner, starting from business lounges and further at boarding and in airplane, however, this review is not aimed to make a long story but just to express the general status of the services by Lufthansa. Last but not least, recent changes in price policies and in-flight services just confirm the general trend of company degradation. For example, on some international flights longer than 2 hours (flight FRA-LED), which I recently used, there is no more complimentary food/drinks service. The ticket price, however, increased!

The food served on my business class flights were uninspired tasteless sandwiches. They looked similar to the sandwiches Lufthansa used to serve in Economy until a few months ago. If this is their strategy to attract full fare paying guests in Business they really got it wrong. It’s an absolute disgrace for people paying so much money expecting a standard above average.

The company canceled the inbound flights twice where I had to call multiple times to have them rescheduled. Within one week of our travel, they canceled (again) the last leg. When I called (again), this time, I was told that the full ticket was canceled and, there were no other available flights for November or December. The free flight change would only cover flights to the same destination within 7 days of the initial booking dates. If I would like to reschedule for January onwards, I would have to pay 1100 Euro per passenger. Or, according to customer support, the best option was to get a refund and book the flights with another company. Being close to Christmas (a peak period) increased our travel costs by more than three times.

2021-11-08,"""overhead bin filled up quickly"" ",5,"Not Verified |  The first leg BER-FRA was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft. The flight is completely full and the boarding was chaotic without much prioritisation of the Group number. Most passengers brought along huge cabin luggage. The gate staff announced to encourage passengers to check their bags free of charge, but they didn’t go out of their way to pick some obviously large and oversized bags. Once onboard, the overhead bin filled up quickly. Cabin crew were standoff-ish, saying that it was not their job to facilitate the space arrangement.  The flight was further delayed because passengers continued to run up and down the aisle to find space. Once arrived in Frankfurt, there was nobody at the gate to facilitate connecting passengers, so everyone ran for themselves. My second flight FRA-LHR was also further delayed for unknown reasons. Upon boarding, I was told to go to another gate staff to have my documents checked for COVID & locator form etc. The other staff  refused to do it because it wasn’t her duty, whilst the one holding that duty was nowhere to be found. Once onboard, again, similar situation with the overhead bin space reoccurred, but this time the male steward were slightly more hands-on than the previous flight, but they still could do more. This trip wasn’t the first time I encountered LH cabin crew staff’s attitude towards assistance with the overhead bin space. Since before COVID, I’ve gradually switched from BA to LH as my preferred full-service airline, but the LH cabin crew attitude is making me think twice on my future flights, especially LH has now scaled down the inflight catering whilst BA started to offer some free stuff

We were so much tired, with a so little baby, so many and hard flights. At that (third) city (i don't remember which exactly, it was just for transition), we were already exhausted. We forgot my small bag at the airplane with my phone, documents, bank cards, money ut already couldn't return for it. I was in panic, cause in 1.5h we had another flight, to Kyiv. I, with a little baby on my hands, saw an airport crew guy - Mr Lenz, told him about my trouble. Truth be said I didn't think he can help, i thought he sends me to the special service for finding things  as most are doing.. But he said: don't worry, take care of your kids, I will get it for you. I was very happy. The airplane already wasn't at the place, Cristian did real magic and found that my bag before our next flight. I appreciate it so much! I even don't know what we would do, especially with 2 month old baby, who was already very tired. I'm so grateful this Person for His heart and willing to help.

I used to fly transatlantic several times a year and Lufthansa was always a good option - not anymore. On a 12-hour flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City (10,5 hours backwards) they don’t even offer meal options anymore! They just shove you a vegetarian pasta which is edible but unsatisfying. The “breakfast” is also vegetarian, both times it was a tortilla with cheese filling, it was cold and stale and I couldn’t eat it though I was hungry. On the 3-hour flight from Frankfurt to Moscow they don’t even serve free drinks - they give you a 300ml bottle of water a tiny chocolate bar at the end (you can grub several if you are really starving). Coffee and probably some snacks you can buy from them - that’s how it works now. In general, food service is a disgrace and the flight attendants are polite but very abrupt. With their masks on, they are like robots - gone is all the niceness and kindness and good humour. All they care about is that your mask is covering your nose properly at all times. It’s more like a sanitary convoy, not a service, and that was the impression throughout all 4 flights with them that I’ve had recently.

Eventually we managed to rebook with an increased travel time of 12 hours and after having spent 4 hours on the phone at 40p per minute over 3 days. The customer service is appalling.

From what I can see on the Lufthansa tracking on their site the baggage was sent on 28.12.2021 from Vienna to Malta, and then for some unknown reason from Malta to Frankfurt - however, Malta Airport is reporting the luggage never even landed in Malta. Since then I have had to contact Lufthansa who claims there is no report even made, I have called Frankfurt Airport, Vienna Airport, and Copenhagen Airport to try and get some assistance, I have been passed around and have to communicate with Central Baggage Services and World Tracker – this is beyond infuriating and also just simply unfair as Lufthansa should be able to at the very least guide me in what to do and see where the error happened.

I had a long argument with the agent who nearly refused to issue my boarding passes although I had all the necessary documents with me (and no problem at all at immigration in Dubai later). Flight from Berlin to Munich on time, but otherwise nothing to praise about it. Lufthansa has introduced a buy on board service on domestic and European flights, but they didn't offer anything on this flight, so even if I had wanted, I couldn't get a coffee or snack. Munich airport is very easy to transfer, but repeated document checks at the gate resulted in a delayed departure. First time flying in Lufthansa's premium economy, and while I liked the seat comfort and additional space, it's disappointing that the service has been reduced to exactly the same as in regular economy, apart from a tiny glass of juice after boarding. They also cut the nuts or crackers with the first drink round, and they now serve coffee or tea together with the meal. That doesn't make any sense as your coffee will be cold once you have finished the meal.

Over the years I have traveled numerous times on Lufthansa and I’m sad to say that this time around, Lufthansa did not live up to its reputation of being Europe’s 5 star airline. The meal choice was poor (only veggie pasta on both legs) and the service of the crew left much to be desired. It seems like the lack of customer service just gets blamed on Covid. Worst of all was the terrible spacing/leg room in economy class. It is big enough for a 10 year old kid but not for a normal size adult. It really felt like the airline wanted to cramp in more passengers to make up for the losses incurred during the pandemic without any regard to the comfort of passengers. On the second leg of our journey we even wanted to upgrade to premium economy or business class but turns out since the FRA-JHB route is so busy, both flights were fully booked. As a Miles and More member I was deeply disappointed. I usually don’t complain about airlines and I’m not pleased I even had to write this one. However, comparing the passenger comfort and the customer service of Lufthansa to that of the middle eastern airlines, or even other European airlines, it really makes me question whether I should fly Lufthansa ever again.

What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time?

For Lufthansa also, the company modified the flights, telling me that some of the internal flights were to be modified, around March. It took hours with customer services to find and agree on another internal flight, only for the trip to be cancelled two days later. This has happened several times. The company is now cancelling all these flights in April, which is understandable in view of the global crisis. The postponement of flights is done on the month of May, where the customer service simply tell me that my flight has been moved as is to the following month. A few weeks before departure, internal flights were also cancelled, forcing me to spend hours on the phone to get a new flight and keep my trip. Once done, the flight was cancelled again, telling me that the company had no flights in April and postponed my trip to May. It's also the same story when my May flight date arrives, hours on the phone to change an internal flight after it was cancelled only to be told that my flight has to be rescheduled for June. Except that I consulted the company's website to check if a new reservation was possible. Indeed, the company was operating flights but the tickets were close to 5000$. The company's strategy was simple, postpone my flight booked in November 2019 for 700€ to avoid losing a seat which was then sold at five times. I had to buy another ticket (from another company) to be able to return.

There is a menu in the seat pocket in front of you, where those little things are being advertised as ‘onboard delights’.  For dinner there was the choice of vegetarian pasta, pasta or pasta. It tasted like nothing. Thankfully this airline has foregone the little salt and paper packet, which might have added a little taste at least. With the meal came the second and final round of drinks for this evening. One bottle of water was given to each fellow passenger and the crew was not seen again until next morning. I remember those occasional rounds of cups with water throughout the night but not anymore. There was no choice for breakfast. The airplane, a 747-8, was modern and clean, IFE was working okay and the choice of films were satisfactory, too. Seats typical economy style, I found them ok in terms of legroom, but very narrow for the shoulders. The return flight was a copy of the outbound flight.

Tried to go to the customer service disk at gates B it was closed, went to the lounge who were of no help and directed me to another service disk, went there and staying in the business and first class line, people in front of me were clearly also from economy also, took me more that an hour to sort my connecting flight, and I had to suggest to them a more suitable connection.

No one could be bothered to even look at it. I hadn’t eaten anticipating being fed on board. Service, I was passed a tray, the smell of which had begun to permeate the cabin. No option. Most of which was sparse and totally inedible. The crew after service was conspicuously absent having blacked out the cabin. At lighting up time 1 hr 45 mins from BKK. Another “offering” was handed to me. Mostly inedible, a comically bad sandwich. The sum of all I could stomach was a bread roll and a yoghurt for a ten hour 50 minute trip. I was Ravenous by BKK and destroyed a KFC on arrival. That’s a first in over 40 years of flying. Mean, penny pinching in tough times I can kind of understand, these are tough times.

Late departure, cramped seats, underseat storage was only 3 half-size slots for 4 people (not big enough for a regular size backpack), none of our bags fit, the entertainment system was exceedingly slow and crashed 5 times leading to a blank screen. The flight attendants ignored the call button, I rang it 4 times in 30 minutes and they never peaked out from behind the curtain, I could hear them chatting on the other side, there were numerous other call lights illuminated in the cabin - all went unattended. When I arrived at the transfer airport, they shuttled us all onto our new flight only to wait several hours on the tarmac before telling us that the flight was cancelled. When we were returned to the terminal, the line to speak to customer service was about 500 people long. I waited in line for an hour before an airline employee came and told a large group of us that there was another service desk on the other side of the terminal with no line. He led us all the way across the terminal only to find that the line was easily twice as long. I ended up waiting in the new line for another 2 hours. When I finally got to the front, I was told there was only 1 seat left on any flight on any airline to my destination within 48 hrs, it left 31 hours after my original flight and I had to take it now or leave it. I took it, only to find out on my way to the hotel that I could have rebooked my flight in about 60 seconds via the chat bot on their website and caught a flight within 2 hrs (it had multiple seats available) By the time I discovered this, it was too late to return to the airport and catch the flight, so I had to spend a night in the stopover city, arriving at my destination more than 24 hrs late. The entire experience was a nightmare and I don’t understand how they’re still in business. Speaking of which, the taxi and hotel immediately knew that I was coming from a cancelled Lufthansa flight, it seemed like all of their business came from customers in the same situation.

It took us almost two hours to find an open Lufthansa service desk. Three of them were closed. We had to go thru the control to get to the open one So hour and a half later (7pm) the lady at service desk told us that we have to wait till next day 10.45 am to continue our journey and she gave us hotel accommodations off the premises of the airport and there is a shuttle to take us there. 30 minutes to get to the shuttle stop we had to wait for the bus for an hour and a half to find out that the shuttle is not equipped for handicapped people with the chair. Somehow we managed to load my grandma on this shuttle and when we came to hotel they had no ADA equipped rooms or even elevators. We did mange that (I had to carry her again) and went back to our flight in the morning. We were told at the gate that we will be preboarding before everyone else. That didn’t happen cause the person who was suppose to open the elevator for us was nowhere to be found. So we had to wait till everyone boards and then walk through all the people to our seats.

We initially tried to book through Air Canada with this flight, but were informed that as we are travelling with a pet we need to call Lufthansa directly. Everything seemed fine and I gave my debit card details to the operator and was told I'd receive my booking confirmation within 72hrs. After 1 week I didn't receive anything, so I called again and this operation took my card information as if he was booking me another ticket, again I was assured I will receive the booking confirmation within 72hrs. Another week passes and I've received nothing (we can all see the pattern here!), so I call again. This operator told me that the payment couldn't go through as it was a Visa Debit card, so my partner gave her credit card and the payment went through in the time frame or so we thought! We still haven't received a confirmation for our pet in cabin. We call again (several times) to get a confirmation that our pet would be joining us on the flight, we were given 4 different responses, but always promised the confirmation will arrive by tomorrow or 48hrs or 72hrs (depending on who we spoke to). One month passes by and we give up and decide to leave it up to chance arriving with our pet at the airport with the hopes we can take him. But it doesn't end there, about 1.5 months after booking our flights I receive another booking confirmation email for the same flight and the price was taken from my account. So I call and cancel that flight and received a refund of the full amount. I know what your thinking ""It must end here!"", think again. On the day I received my refund I had two more transactions taken from my account, totaling the amount that I was just refunded! In our preparation to move to another continent, I had missed these transactions coming from my account. So the night before my flight, as I was checking in, I noticed and I called explaining my story to the operator, she was no help at all as we were trying to figure out this issue. The call then dropped. Calling back again I got another operator and at this point I wanted to speak to someone with more knowledge, so I asked for the manager. He told me this isn't possible and that he can help me, I expressed that I have called about a dozen times to simply get a flight for 2 people and a pet, I've been booked on the same flight twice and charged three times. At this point I just wanted to speak to someone with a bit more experience. I was put on hold and told it wasn't possible for him to do that, but he did direct me to their website to request a refund, (I mean come on, that's the best you can do, submit a refund for a flight that I've already cancelled?). I thank him for and submit the form, but there was nowhere to upload the documents. So I called again, explained the situation to another person and I was giving an email to send my bank statements to and now I wait!

After 5 hours of staying in line for their service, I was told that Lufthansa is not obliged to give vouchers for accommodation and transfer due to their fault. In turn I would have to pay everything myself and have the possibility to invoice them to Lufthansa. Very disappointed.

2022-06-02,"""cutting costs with the food and drink service""",5,"Not Verified |  My return leg from Johannesburg to Tokyo on Swiss had been cancelled and I was put on a Lufthansa flight. The flight was OK but i really felt the food and drink situation was terrible. Johannesburg to Frankfurt was about 10 hours. The first meal consisted of a salad of carrot, squash and aubergine, a roll, a cake with raisins, and a dry pasta with some tomato sauce. Initially, I thought that as the plane was full and I was at the back of the plane that this was the left over option. It transpires that there is only one option and it is vegetarian which doesn't bother me but might others. The pasta was pretty horrible and really felt like something a student might make. Just past and a bit of tomato sauce. the salad was small and bland. The roll and cake were fine. The second meal (breakfast) was a yoghurt a cereal bar and a dry sandwich (also vegetarian). Beer and wine are complimentary but spirits are not and come in at about 7 euros. No snacks or nuts with the drink service though you can buy them. The seat was fine, the entertainment system was difficult to use and had an average selection. The second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda which was around 15 hours due to closed Russian airspace was in airbus. The plane was new and clean and the entertainment system was easier to operate. However the food and drink situation was the same. In fact the same nasty pasta was served this time accompanied by a couple of chopped up lettuce leaves. breakfast was the same too. I really felt that for 15 hours on a plane there wasn't much food. I understand that times are tough for the airline industry and that probably Lufthansa are cutting costs with the food and drink service but times are tough for the passenger too and being fed not very much and of poor quality on two different transcontinental flights is a poor showing especially on what is supposed to be a premium airlines.",Economy Class,4,3,1,2,2,no,1901,,Solo Leisure,Johannesburg to Tokyo via Frankfurt,May 2022,4,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

Once onboard, staff did not greet us, but directly inquired about the seat row. We found the seat area in business class poorly cleaned and with visible traces of spilled drinks from the previous flight. No welcome drink was served, as is usually the case on Lufthansa. Once airborne, we were served a sausage salad, which was one of the most appalling airline meals I’ve ever had. As dessert we were offered an apple in a paper bag, which we declined. Drinks were served out of synch with the food - here as well the service standards were poor, as all drinks were served lukewarm (including the sparkling wine).

For drinks they offered some juices, water, wine. The morning omelette was more or less ok, tomato near raw and cold, piece of bread was hard to bite. Also staff were very rude to me.

They just cancelled my ticket without notifying me. Of course, they would not hear anything or try to find a solution. ""We're sorry"" was all they could say. The return flight from Rennes to Frankfurt on June 18th? Also cancelled. The worst is yet to come: the client service is incredibly bad. No one can give me a precise answer or find a solution. No rebooking or refund is being made. They told me the ""no-show"" is automatically cancelling the other flights, but why not put it clearly somewhere? Why not send an email?

The app is also not of assistance. If you want to upgrade your seats, the service desk is not able to assist or they claim everything is sold out but ask people to keep an eye for availabilities. We naturally did this, and last minute upgraded our seats, only to realize that they sell it nearly for free in the airport - this to advise that we tried to upgrade to business via phone but was told that it was sold out. In the airport they sold business cheaper than we had bought premium economy seats at the day before. Business was nearly empty on the flight and we were not allowed to upgrade in the airport, despite wanting to pay for same, as you can only upgrade once. When boarding we were shocked to see the seats, as the pictures of the class on their web is absolutely not picturing what you actually get. On the return flight, we again wanted to upgrade, as one of the ticket holders got injured and upgraded to business by the insurance company. We managed to upgrade the rest of us to prem eco only to find out, than in 3 weeks they had removed the ""all incl"" in the prem eco, hence limited avails of the drinks (both soft and alch). This wasn't even mentioned while being upgraded. Entertainment on board is very limited or not working. Very few movies, games platform not working at any of the flights and the wifi was not working on any of the flights. The food back from Mexico was not edible - and we are really not having high thoughts for food on board a flight - but when you pay a fortune to get food on board, then you should at least be served food which is being well cooked in order to eat it. Pancakes served for breakfast was not even fried enough to be able to eat it.

However, once we got there after waiting in a 35 minute line for customer service, we were simply told this is the wrong line and to walk “that way” toward the double doors. In an airport that big, you think they could give better directions but no. Then once again, we asked for more directions and their ambiguity of directions appalled me. However, after searching for the “correct” customer service for half an hour, with little to no help from anyone we found it. They were very accommodating and put us up in a hotel 20 min away from the hotel free of charge. However, we asked if we could get our luggage so we could have our change of clothes, our toiletries, etc, and they weren’t able to do anything because “they were already headed to our final destination” which I would have understood. However, as I landed in New York this morning I received a text message that my bag couldn’t be loaded on schedule, which leaves the question as to why I couldn’t get it in the first place. I was flying home for a surgery for a fractured jaw so I thought Lufthansa would be a bit more accommodating due to that fact, but no. Not at all. So I am now left with no contacts, no toiletries, no clothes and the hassle of having to reschedule doctor appointments and surgery.

In my last flight from Frankfurt to St Louis the quality of the food was pathetic to say the least. It seems the quality of food that was served earlier to Economy class is now being served to Premium Economy. The Economy Class food is not up to the mark of Lufthansa level. Last year I had a very unpleasant experience at Valencia airport while travelling to Dubai and I couldn't fly. I had to buy an Emirates flight as an alternate as it was an urgent journey and I was more than surprised with the excellent service and the quality of the flight.

They gave us the tracking number and we filled the forwarding address for the luggage. But then after 3 days, the tracking stopped without notice and we lost the trace of our luggage. Last it was seen in Frankfurt we believe. Now, there is no one to contact and the lost luggage office in Bucharest states that there is not much they can do.

I checked in no problem and well you got me to my point of destination with relative ease, my my my, how that has changed. This airline has made my life living hell in just 24 hours. They have screwed me not once, not twice, but about a million times over. Let's break it down. I am going to start with their website. The website is absolutely appalling in terms of navigation, to find any information on the website, you must navigate the entire website dictionary. Not to mention the pages upon pages of useless code (meaning the pages don't work). I will save you some time by giving you a few pages that don't work - The Baggage Calculator, The COVID 19 Related Documents Uploading Page, The login and Sign Up pages, and a ton of the characters and typography. All I can say is whoever is doing the code for the Lufthansa website needs to fired. Let's move on to baggage. For a long-haul flight, I feel like a personal item (a purse or backpack), a carry-on item (a small bag), and a checked bag are acceptable, especially considering the flight was $1,500 USD. But no. Not on Lufthansa, you have to shove everything you need for a 10-hour flight into a single carry-on bag that must weigh under 8kg. I work with technology for a living and what I need for my job alone weighs 8kg. Unfortunately, I will not be able to pack everything I need for the next 2 years into two bags, so I looked for how much it will cost to take 3 bags. There is not a dang thing on the website on how much it costs to check another bag. So I call Lufthansa. Nothing. So I call again. I could not get a hold of any operator or person even within the business hours, nor would they let me wait on the phone for someone. No contact, how convenient Lufthansa. Website flaw, maybe, customer service flaw, absolutely. It is now just 22 hours away from my flight. I currently live 2 hours away from the airport and can I check in for my flight online...nope, I have to check-in at the airport conveniently located nowhere near me. Oh and just so you are aware, the Lufthansa check-in page doesn't work either. All in all, I would not wish this kind of stress on my worst enemy and lord do I hope that you the customer are not flying on Lufthansa because you won't even be able to check-in for your flight.

Upon arriving in Athens, we had to wait till all luggage was delivered to realise that one of ours didn't make it and file a missing luggage report. This was the 6th June. To-date, I have heard nothing from the airline. The online tool to monitor the luggage tracing delivers zero updates and lacks any functionality. A week after the luggage was missing, we filed a luggage irregularity report via the PDF form on Lufthansa's website but to my dismay, the ""send"" button refused to take any action. We emailed the airline's support to receive a reply 24 hours later, with some generic content, stating that we didn't provide all needed information. Since then, I have followed up once more and as expected received nothing back. Putting the luggage issues aside, the overall experience of their business class service was totally disappointing.

The seat was great to spend time in that long and the noise of the aircraft is much lower and therefore I enjoyed the journey very much. Staff attitude was ok. I was little surprised that have to pay for spirits, but I can understand this due to the current economic climate in the world.

I tried to complain and they shut me down especially with an extremely rude staff at the Detroit airport with both supervisors being extremely rude and didn’t want to solve the problem. They even don’t answer the customer service phone line nor emails and no refund for all the inconvenience they caused especially with last minute cancellation of my return flight which delayed me about 2 weeks from my original date where they wanted to charge me the difference for it. I see lack of coordination between them and other airlines in addition in lots of inaccuracies within their system.

2022-07-14,"""huge all round disappointment""",2,"✅ Trip Verified |  We recently had the misfortune to fly Lufthansa on 5 legs of an international trip. The booking class was in Premium Economy. Fortuitously - the 6th leg of the journey was on a code share partner Air Canada. The Air Canada experience was truly great and a marked contrast to the most disappointing Lufthansa flights . And the Lufthansa Premium Economy experience was a supreme disappointment. In fact - the entire Lufthansa experience was terrible. This starting on their website - in which I wrote a note querying some assistances required. Despite being promised an answer within 2 days, Lufthansa never bothered to acknowledge nor respond! On to the flights, the seating was pretty much the same as economy. And there appeared to be very few toilets on the plane, with access to all and sundry. The food was very poor. The drinks service was abysmal, one drink allowed  and that was it! No doubt Lufthansa on a cost saving program? Found the air hostesses to be less than helpful- and in some instances even rude. Lufthansa premium Economy is sold at a 50% premium to the normal Economy. This is in our opinion an absolute rip off. We most certainly will NOT be flying Lufthansa again.

Although we were not given headphones to use the inflight entertainment, we were able to stay entertained by our own devices. As soon as dinner came around, there were 2 options which were fried egg rice with chicken, or a pasta with cheese, tomatoes and other vegetables. The food was overall very good although I did not like a sweet and sour salad.  As we left the airplane and went passed the security gate, I had realized that I left my wallet on the pocket of my seat in the airplane and there was no way for me or my dad to get it back. We had to go through a minimum pain of contacting the service center and they were able to get us back the wallet in fast time.

I’m no stranger to the exit row seats and my wife and I are capable of assisting passengers and opening exit door in the event of an emergency. Also the cabin crew should assess if passengers sitting in the exit row seats are able to function and assist other passengers. Food and beverage service was outstanding. We had a female pilot in the cockpit who did a superb job managing the aircraft and kept us abreast of all situations including delays, which we were delayed taking off and landing. It was a good flight, the A350 is a very nice aircraft.

As we took off the pilot announced that air traffic control in Frankfurt was monitoring our flight from Vienna as most of the passengers onboard had connecting flights and that we would all make our connecting flights on time. We landed in Frankfurt only 5 minutes late, and then the pilot announced that Lufthansa had transport waiting at the aircraft for us and two other passengers who were also flying to Dublin. A comfortable mini-bus transported us across the airport to a small police office where we had our passports checked, and then back onto the bus and driven across the tarmac to a remote departure gate that we would never have reached on time. We were then escorted to a lift/elevator by Lufthansa staff and into the departure lounge which was only about to board when we arrived.

The touch screens were horribly slow and old, and staff said they were =out of wired earbuds. Meaning any of us with airpods were out of luck for the nine hour flight if you wanted to watch a movie. Meals were okay, but the cold sandwich (cheese and veggies) was not good. Our flight ended up being over 11 hours due to a detour in Philly because of thunderstorms. We had to sit on the tarmac while the plane was refueled. They did an okay job of keeping us updated, but none of us appreciated being alerted to the detour literally ten minutes before the detoured landing.

Seated in front of exit row. No window and no recline seat. Good thing it was only a 1 hour flight. Frankfurt Airport was horrid. Bussed us from remote pad to A terminal. Then had to walk 3/4 mile through A to C terminal, but required to exit secure zone when left terminal A. There was two separate B terminal security lines which were at least 200 yards long. Figured lots of people would miss flights in that terminal The line for C terminal security took around 45 minutes. Although we had a connection time of 1.5 hours we barely made it through security to the C15 gate in time. When going through the boarding ticket scan I was told I had to pay for baggage which I had already paid on check in at Basel. Gate agent had no record of us paying for baggage which would have cost us another $100. I finally reasoned with gate agent that we had already checked bags in Basel and paid the fee in Basel so they finally waived the extra baggage fee. we boarded the plane exhausted and dehydrated from the walk. After walking as fast as we could From A to C, we did not have time to purchase any water because it would be discarded at security in C terminal. we were thinking we would get a bottle of water on the plane. Sat on ground after boarding for another 1/2 hour. No beverage service for at least 30 minutes after take off. No bottle of water, only a half full 6 oz plastic cup. And no ice. Servers skipped us twice during flight and only offered drink service 30 minutes after takeoff, during the meal two hours into flight and two additional times before the ""snack"" during the 11 hour flight. The snack before landing was two pieces of bread and a slice of white cheese. I had to ask the servers for some water twice after being skipped. Seats and legroom seemed smaller than those on Delta.

I have purchased the tickets Vilnius - Frankfurt-am-Main - Halifax with an 8 hours stop at Frankfurt Airport aiming to meet up with friends there and travel further to Canada. Though I checked-in 24 hours before departure it turned out that the flight LH889 was overbooked and app. 20 passengers incl. me were left behind. The airport personnel first asked us to proceed to the gate and wait until departure probably hoping (!) that some places will reveal themselves. But the miracle was not there and 20 unhappy passengers were asked to go to the airport workers to rebook their flights. After 1.5 hour waiting, fortunately, a Vilnius airport employee found a solution for me and managed to rebook the flight to Frankfurt via Amsterdam. So I had to stop at one more airport and spent in the air 2.5 + 1.5 hours (Vilnius - Amsterdam - Frankfurt / Main) instead of around 1 hour 10 min (Vilnius - Frankfurt/Main). I was acceptable as long as I was on time for my connecting flight to Halifax. But the next ""surprise"" was waiting for me in Halifax. My luggage did not arrive. I immediately filed a report at the airport and waited patiently a week as it was agreed with the lost&found service. Since then I regularly write complaints and emails to airports and Lufthansa and receive no feedback at all! Nobody answers the phone either. On top of all these circumstances I had to cancel my fully refundable return ticket due to personal reasons and was shocked by the refunded 80 USD instead of 611 USD. The bad part is that you do not received the responses on your emails or cannot reach Lufthansa workers on phone.

Upon our plane landing in Munich, the pilot and flight attendant staff instructed us that there are no more flights until tomorrow and to go straight to the Lufthansa service desk to assist us due to our circumstances and missing connections. Once we exited the plane and got into the airport, the Lufthansa Munich service desk immediately made an intercom announcement stating that they are closing their service desk (regardless of a plane full of people just arriving off of a Lufthansa flight with nowhere to go) and told us that there are no hotel rooms available for us, no transportation, no meals and to sleep in the airport. They were very rude to us and would not answer any questions we had.  The service desk staff told us that they will not give us any new boarding passes or more information on backup plans, etc until 0600 the next morning. Over a hundred of us were left stranded after midnight in horrible conditions.  The only option I had at that point was to find a taxi to get me home.

I was in queue for a few hours and when it was my turn the customer agent was not very friendly. However, my new flight details were never sent to my email. I added on an extra baggage for my return flight but I was only allowed one check in baggage for the new flight. Because I didn't want to waste money on roaming calls, I used the live chat option on their website, of which they are even more unresponsive and I had to retry several times and wait a few hours before I got to chat with a live agent. This time, I rebooked to another (less ideal) flight but I didn't have a choice as I had to find my way home somehow. When it was less than 2 weeks away from my return flight, I got notified again that my flight got cancelled, they said that they were unable to rebook me on a flight anytime for the whole of July to the first few days of August. When I searched on the Lufthansa website to try and book a one way flight back home, I saw that they clearly had multiple flights back home with plenty of seats still available. However, the agent said that those flights were not accessible for me to rebook. At this point it was clear that Lufthansa did not respect me at all. Not only did they cancel my original flight back home, they did not allow me to rebook on similar flights, instead asking me to delay my flight back home by at least 2 weeks. I was so done with them and asked if they had an email which I can complain to, but there was none. in the end, I asked for refund (which I have still yet to receive) and booked a one way flight with another airline.

There, after another 4-5 hour wait, I was told that my entire booking had been canceled by the computer system because it had considered me missing my initial connecting flights as a “no show”. In addition to canceling my booking the computer system had also surrendered the seats I had been rebooked on and these were now unavailable. I was then told that Lufthansa was unable to rebook me on a Lufthansa or star alliance flight for a period of at least 4-5 days. After further long delays I was offered a booking through Emirates and was told that that journey was my only option to get back to New Zealand. At this point, my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 03/08/22 – delay 74 hours I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher and spent the night at tyet another hotel where air-conditioning was available but unfortunately broken! This made for another uncomfortable night. Again hygiene amenities were not available. On the 01/08/22 at 1300 I presented myself to the check in counter at FRA only to be told that my ticket was on stand-by. I was eventually provided a boarding pass for the flights but was made to pay 246 euro to have the extra piece of luggage, which was included in the initial Lufthansa ticket, carried to my final destination. Generally I thought the airline representatives were not taking responsibility for the inconvenience that I experienced as a result of the disorganisation. I barely got an apology and worse was made to feel that I was inconveniencing them. Furthermore I was plainly lied to multiple times.

The boarding process was slow and delayed. The management were very unprofessional, giving me a negative attitude. The (staff) standard was low class. I would use the word cheap. A company training their ground staff to use cheap flirty tactics on valuable passengers. To me Lufthansa needs a change in managing and training their staff. However the inflight service was relatively ok and the seats were comfortable. The inflight service was ok as the fight attendants had done a good enough job to comfort their passengers. The staff in Frankfurt were ok but not overly impressive. The flight coming back was delayed but it was ok. Overall, I rate the service in Vancouver was unacceptable as it would be 2/10 but inflight was ok 8/10 and Frankfurt staff was 7/10. Good enough for my trip back. Lufthansa really need to upgrade and improve their service in Vancouver. I will be travelling a lot for my new career and I will be an important part of the world’s success going forward. I will be an important person to the country. I do not see Lufthansa as a company who tries to improve but rather a company who tries to hide from the truth.

After many hours struggling with Lufthansa customer service and their useless chat-bot I finally managed to rearrange my flights for Saturday, arriving in Ljubljana at lunchtime. This meant I would miss part of the Congress itinerary, but the formal start wasn't until Monday. Then when I went to check in online on Friday my whole outward trip to LJU vanished! More hours on hold for LH customer services, including one memorable 2.5hr hold. Finally the managed to find flights for me on Saturday evening to Frankfurt arriving at 11pm and then onto Ljubljana at 9.00am the next day getting me at lunchtime. This meant that I would now miss two days. I got the flight at LHR, checking in two piece of hold baggage. I arrived at FRA and went to the hotel desk only to be told that the hotel I had been allocated was on the other side of Frankfurt. When I finally got there it turned out LH had sent lots of people there and the poor hotel staff were having difficulty checking so many people in near midnight. By the time I checked in it was midnight and the bar and the only food facility had closed. The next morning I returned to FRA to continue my flight. When I got on board I asked the flight attendant if she could check that my luggage had been loaded as there had been such a long delay between flights. She told me that the Load Master assured her it was. When I finally arrived in Ljubljana there was no sign of my luggage.

Price was outrageous, around 6,700 EURO / person, so 21,000 EUR altogether. Service for that price was completely inadequate. Seating: I'm tall but not super tall (6 ft 5''). Did not fit while sleeping into the narrow seat on the A330-300 Business Class, thus couldn't sleep at all. Used to fly a lot between NYC and FRA on the 747-800 (Business Class). That is a completely different size of seat, so it feels like they are trying to fit more seats into Business Class by shrinking the comfort.  Not enough Meals: We were 3 persons on that flight, each person getting their menu at the beginning of the flight. Turns out, they couldn't serve us what we wanted as they did not have enough meals on board. Compare that against the ticket price of 6,700 EURO per person. Also cabin service overall was mediocre ... this is a 9 h 30 min flight and there was close to zero service between meals. You had to actively get up and ask for anything you wanted. Can understand if you try to minimize disturbing sleep of the passengers, but no service is not the answer to that. Lastly, I have gold status (Senator) at LH and was asking at check in if they could connect that flight with my miles account which they said they did ('Are you sure?' Yes!). Turns out, this is not the case. Other than that, check in was nice and helpful. So overall after that experience in combination with that premium price, I would say LH are on the way to serve the market with premium marketing and price, but mediocre performance.

The first leg from Brussels to Frankfurt was Okay, I do not remember anything extraordinary about it, it was a short 40 minute flight in a regular plane with a regular very-short-haul experience. The second leg from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv was rather odd. We had a connection of 2.5 hours. When we landed in Frankfurt on time the screens showed us the flight was already boarding, which we found to be very weird. We sprinted to the gate, through connection security and passport control, and were devastated to discover that apparently, Israel has special travel regulations that make all flights landing to Israel go through a special process. Our gate was separated from all other gates, it had extra security and when we passed it we saw there is no plane even at the gate. So after security we were essentially locked in a gate that had only one super-over-priced store selling basic literature and food. We waited for 90 minutes until boarding started. When we sat in the plane the pilot announced that our plane ""has the wrong wheels"" and that it would take us 3 hours to replace all the wheels of the aircraft. All passengers were angry. After 40 minutes the captain announced that we will be brought back to the gate, and transferred to a different aircraft. After an hour buses were organized to the new airplane, same model, A321. Once we arrived there were a few dramas involving passengers that were mad that because the configuration was a bit different in the new plane, couldn't seat next to their loved ones. After an intervention of the German police we took off. The crew was excellent, especially A Stadelmann, who although being very tired as we did, did her best and gave an excellent service. At turbulence when I panicked she noticed and calmed me, we had a quick chat and all in all she was very welcoming, using words like ""dear"" to make me feel warm and welcome aboard the plane. The flight was regular, there was no entertainment, and complimentary soft drinks and disgusting sandwiches were given.

The food service was okay, but it was served off of trolleys like you were in coach. We haven’t seen anything like this in another business class. And, they didn’t give an amenity kits. When we went to the lavatories, we saw offerings of masks and razors and earplugs, but nobody told us about them, And some items were already empty. When you’re paying for business class, you really should get an amenity kit. Even if it’s not the best one in the world. The minimal amount they’re saving, that’s really shameful. Also, they didn’t offer us bottled water until we got off the plane.

2022-09-24,"""no desire to travel again with Lufthansa""",2,"✅ Trip Verified |  Not a good experience all round with Lufthansa. I thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in Munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of Star Alliance. First, the positives. They automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in Frankfurt. Also our baggage did not get lost. So they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. So, what went wrong? Inconveniently, there was not a single member of Lufthansa staff available at the airport in Munich. Thankfully we had downloaded the Lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. Customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or SMS communication. EU passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. However, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". We took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to Frankfurt departed. Having to spend a night in Munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. The food that Lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. Crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into Munich. All the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. Lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. The designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. There were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. Perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of Lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. The next morning we boarded our new flight to Frankfurt at 6am. On arrival, I searched out the Lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. Most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of Lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. They did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for Muscat, so that meant spending an extra €17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. No further dramas onward to Muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. It has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from Lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law. The only communication we've had was an email telling us to confirm our new itinerary (sent 2 days AFTER we arrived) and an automated email in response to my complaint, which asked me to submit my flight details (which I had already done 3 times by this point). This experience is in stark contrast to a previous experience with KLM, travelling to Dubai via Amsterdam, where we were given the compensation in cash at the service desk, and there was a driver waiting outside to take us to a hotel for the night.

2022-10-09,"""Absolutely despicable""",1,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst company to fly with. We flew it coming here because my husband is European and he believed Lufthansa was a good airline. We first took it from SFO and the first problem was they made us pay for luggage even though I showed the agent that our ticket included 1 checked luggage. I always pay for luggage beforehand because it’s a lot cheaper than what they make you pay at the airport. He made us pay $75 anyways. This rubbed me the wrong way but I went on with the vacation. Of course my husband wanted to use them going back to SFO so we did. First, they left late so the plane was delayed and we missed our connection. We tried to run and make it but were held up in Germany because the lady was upset that she couldn’t find a stamp in my passport even though I kept telling her I have a residency card for Italy so I don't get a stamp. We missed our connection and then had to deal with customer service from hell at Lufthansa. They guy was unbelievably rude. I first asked him if there was another, earlier flight he could put us on so that we wouldn’t have to sit at the airport for like 5 hours. He said no. I asked him if there was a customer service centre and I guess that made him mad because from there he became rude. He told us that we didn’t even pay that much for our ticket and it wasn’t ‘that bad’ and I should be fine with it because it’s not like I’ve never had a delayed flight before. He continued on being rude. I think customer service is definitely the wrong profession for him. I have never ever had to deal with someone like him and I’ve been flying all over the world since I was a teenager.

I was then rebooked for another flight 6 hours later from Munich to Singapore with a 7 hour layover to Seoul. The reason I booked Lufthansa in the first place was to get the direct flight from Europe. But apparently there was not even one seat available on the direct route the day after. I could have stayed at an airport hotel and Lufthansa could have at least guaranteed me a somewhat comfortable sleep as compensation for their delay, but instead I get to spend the night on my way to Singapore and a day at the airport, already tired from the long extra wait, not even to mention missing my meetings in Seoul that I had planned. When I booked my original ticket I had paid extra for window seats, but as the window seats were already fully booked I got an aisle seat and when I asked if I could at least be upgraded for the inconvenience I was told that it would be on my own expense. As I will be almost 24 hours delayed I thought as it states on the Lufthansa website, that I would get the necessary care during the redirecting, but all I got was a 15 euro voucher (which had to be spent all at once) in one of the airport restaurants. Sadly most meals start at 20 euros so it should rather be called a modest meal contribution instead. Very sad to have around 24 hours longer to spend in airport transfer with a 15 euro “meal” voucher, aisle seats despite having already paid for window seats and a service level below minimum.

2022-10-13,"""seats were right in front of the toilets""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had paid for economy seats; my wife went online and reserved aisle seats. She selected seats in a row that was about halfway between the mid and rear toilet areas. (Around row 40) When we arrived at the departure lounge at Munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. The Lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in Business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. The clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. The suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. After some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. When we got on board, I got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that I had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. I hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. When I got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what I thought was mine or my wife's seat. A short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. Some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. The seats my wife and I endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. The seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. There was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. We noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to Singapore. Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. We had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. So, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. We received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. My wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. When we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat. The parents did their best but the crying and continuous getting up and down to silence the baby made sleep impossible for anyone nearby. Cabin staff were noticeably absent in assisting the parents.

While the seating arrangement in 2-2-2 is not the latest standard for business class, I found the seat comfortable enough for 11 hours. On these really long flights, Lufthansa now provides extra padding for the seat to sleep on and a sleeping shirt.

Schedule changes feel very much the norm in today's travel however, I would have hoped the passenger log for my flight would have been correct. Shortly after take off the lead member of the cabin crew took his time to introduce himself to some of the passengers with some polite chat. At this point it became apparent, despite checking in 12 hrs earlier the passenger log had no idea who I was. Asked if I was someone I wasn't, an accusing ""have you changed seats"" was delivered followed by the non reassuring ""oh, no don't worry"" and a clear tone of 'your not at a high enough loyalty member to warrant my time' was delivered in a closing remark. It should be easy for the cabin crew to tell the truth, so when during the second meal service I was informed that the first option was no longer available I was surprised to see the opposite row still able to order and receive, with the polite question asking if option 1 was actually available my original meal choice was found. I can't help thinking Lufthansa have stripped all customer service out of their operation, several attempts to contact the team before the flight were ignored, the only engagement came when they cancelled a section of the journey and asked me to call them, nice touch that their automatic email pretends they have tried to contact me. A small connection flight cancellation was apparently enough to confuse the booking system and the many people in the call centre.  It took six hours of my time reviewing the Lufthansa schedule and and their ticketing availability to find a route that the 'system' would allow. To rub salt into the wound, at HND I was approached by an agent for Lufthansa and asked if I would like to change flights,  for one of the routes I had been denied and that had always shown availability.

Since the booking was made, there have been countless flight and schedule changes requiring us to repeatedly contact customer service to accept changes and/or find alternatives as proposed by the agents and re-book on alternate flights with different airlines, timings, dates, airports etc. Despite the extensive flexibility on our end in terms of these factors, every time we called and confirmed a booking with an agent, we were left to find that the booking had either not been made, changed again, or entirely cancelled. We have evidence documenting the numerous calls lasting over 50 hours in total, as well as all the emails/screenshots of bookings from the website documenting the booking changes, as well as the flight cancellations that were made without our knowledge and were not informed of until checking ourselves. At this time, despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, the itineraries are missing components of the journey as originally booked ie. the last leg of the trip from DEL - AMD for record locators #1 & 2. The customer service agents have not been able to resolve this and have pretty much said there is nothing they can do in terms of ensuring we have confirmed flights for the entire trip as planned and have left us hanging, without answers, and in a panic as our travel date approaches. I also intend to submit a compensation request as advised by an agent in order to be compensated for the price paid for the flights at the time of booking as well as the additional fare difference to book on ticket now with a different carrier, and making the same request to management if they are unable to resolve our problem internally, by booking us on appropriate Lufthansa/Partner flights as booked and paid for.",Economy Class,1,1,,,1,no,2078,,Family Leisure,New York to Ahmedabad via Frankfurt,July 2022,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany

From Frankfurt I had a 1 hour - 40 minute stop over to reach my connecting flight to HK. An hour before the flight was due to depart I received an email advising me that my Geneva tō Frankfurt flight was going to be 15 minutes late. 30 minutes later, I received another email advising that the flight would now be an hour delayed. A Lufthansa representative eventually advised the delay due to a ‘technical’ problem, and that ground staff would at Frankfurt would be on hand to help all passengers with late or missed connecting flights. While waiting for our plane to land in Geneva we were told the replacement plane was smaller than the original intended plane, as such, our hand carry luggage would have to be surrendered upon boarding, This created even more delays. 40 minutes into the flight, the pilot announced that due to bad weather, the flight would be now diverted to Nuremberg. At the Nuremberg tarmac, we were given little information. Hours later we were told we would be bussed to Frankfurt, however we were waiting for a bus to arrive, and also, there were no ground crew to help disembark the luggage. Later, we were told to collect our luggage and wait for the bus. No specific area was designated. Eventually an airport representative came out and advised the bus would be arriving in 10 minutes The bus ride would take approximately 2 and a half hours. During this entire 6-7 hour Geneva to Frankfurt ordeal, passengers were not fed nor given time to use the bathroom. During the bus ride I received emails from Lufthansa advising me they had, without consulting me, rebooked the remainder of my trip home. This rebooking meant an entirely different route, and it would also mean I would arrive back in New Zealand a whole day later than I had intended. At Frankfurt we disembarked at a bus stop. No Lufthansa representative was there to greet or advise us. The bus driver simply drive away with no instructions. A majority of the passengers stood around lost and confused. Using my phone Google maps, I began walking terminal 1 at Frankfurt airport. At the terminal, we discovered it largely deserted. Not surprisingly as it was well after midnight. Most check-in counters were closed. Eventually we found some staff who handed every passenger vouchers for 1 night stay at a hotel and two taxi vouchers and told us we had to sort out our problems in the morning. Weather problems aside, if there were no technical problem with Lufthansa's plane to begin with, we would have landed in Frankfurt on schedule and avoided the airport closure due to ‘bad weather’ and I would have made my flight to Hong Kong. Even after the bad weather and plane diversion issue, the lack of support and help from Lufthansa made the bad experience worse. There was no attempt by Lufthansa to help or guide us from Nuremberg to Frankfurt, and there was no help at all once we arrived at Frankfurt.

2022-12-02,"""lack of customer service has been appalling""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been at Frankfurt airport after traveling on an early morning flight out of Amman which left at 340am their time. I have been up for over 36 hours at this point and my flight has been delayed multiple times. It was originally supposed to leave at 1040 am and now we are looking at 600pm. We are going to Chicago, and from there have a flight to Charlotte, NC before driving 3.5 hours home. This is on top of being told we will be provided a “meal” but being given only trail mix, some kind of chocolate cookie bar, water and juice. We were also loaded onto shuttle buses that had very few seats, we were packed in like sardines, and taken to the tarmac to board a new flight. We watched them load our luggage while we sat stationary on the tarmac with no explanation. Then they started unloading the luggage back off the plane and we began receiving texts that our flight was delayed again until 4pm them immediately received another text stating it was delayed until 6pm. My partner as significant rheumatological health problems and did not have access to a seat, which is a problem for her, and was in tears from standing stationary on a flat hard surface for so long. There was poor air circulation on the shuttle and the close proximity of everyone packed onto the shuttle quickly made it become suffocatingly hot.  We waited approximately 45 minutes on the shuttle in front of the plane before being told, with zero explanation, that we were being taken back to the gate we had just left.  We were then told that our gate was moved from z54 to B23, which is quiet the hike in the airport. This is on top of sleep deprivation and zero real food. I began researching Lufthansa customer rights and found that we are supposed to be provided with a meal voucher to be used at participating restaurants within the airport and that it is built into the bar code of the boarding pass. When we went to use it, the lady at the restaurant said it was something they honor and use but when she scanned the code, she said it hadn’t been activated by the airline yet. When we came back to the counter to see about having it activated, we were told they couldn’t activate it and a manager had to. It is now 408pm local time.  I understand that delays happen but the overall lack of communication and lack of customer service has been appalling.

After waiting at the Florence airport for 7 hours, Lufthansa cancelled our flight out and claimed weather (not sure how it could have been weather since another flight going to the same place, Frankfurt, was allowed to take off). We were now stranded with no one to help us. We were told to go to the customer service desk where we initially checked in for the flight. The rep recommended that we travel to another airport and book a flight out on a different carrier. We did this at great expense to us. We have since asked Lufthansa to reimburse us for the Lufthansa flight that we never took because it was cancelled by Lufthansa. They refused. I never want to fly this airline again.

An economy seat where the middle seat of the three is left empty as a shared space with the other passenger. Lufthansa does offer a meal depending on the time of day it may be hot(ish) or cold. One nice touch is that on many routes a small bar of chocolate and an apple are offered after the meal. Our flight was a little late departing which was frustrating but understandable as the sub-zero temperatures across Europe were causing delays everywhere. Indeed our flight from Budapest had been so late that we only just made this connection. The cabin crew were excellent and the service brisk and professional.

After 2hrs no one had returned back to the desk to serve the customers. After someone asked we were sent to another customer service desk where again the lady behind the counter finished her shift without being replaced leaving customers again standing in queue with no one to help them. On arrival into Munich the following day (we had to pay for our own accomodation in London) 3 of our bags did not arrive. We placed a lost baggage claim at Munich airport but 4 days later we still do not have the luggage back or even an estimated date. I have made several phone calls trying to chase up where our baggage is (snowboard equipment so we have to hire equipment costing us approximately $2000 AUD) and no representative from Lufthansa is willing to assist us in prioritising our baggage to be located. One baggage service representative even hung up on me!!

After landing in Tunis at 1:30AM and waiting for the luggage at the delivery, we were informed that ""No luggage has not been embarked in Frankfurt"" ""make the queue to register for lost luggage"". Waited 1 hour in the queue, just to be told that the registration can be made online. No Lufthansa personel on site for any explanation. I was surprised by the lack of sincerity from Lufthansa, the plane captain and crew, since they must have known the missing luggage before the departure but failed to share the information to the passengers.  If I was able to make the online registration in the plane, I could have left immediately the airport!

The most horrendous customer service, full of misleading information, and no result, in over 6 months! Needed to rebook parents' flights due to my father's medical emergency back in June... called a zillion times, phones constantly disconnecting, three times spoke to a different rep who rebooked for me, three times supposedly booking was confirmed, but then the booking code disappeared from the LH website... I'm beyond appalled!!! What a scam this airline has become!! I kept calling 1800 645 3880, the USA phone number. For weeks, even months, the voice message would say that the lines were busy and to call later. I finally got my call answered in November. I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. I tried the second time. The second rep assisted, I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. Five times in a row! This cannot be normal. At one point, I asked the rep whether they were having issues with phones, and she responded yes, but they are being worked on. But I called on other days, too, and it was the same. I got disconnected every time I got a rep on the phone. Is this a tactic by Lufthansa to keep customers away? Basically you can't get anything solved, since you get disconnected every time!! And I repeat, EVERY TIME!!! Over a span of two weeks, I called the US phone number about 10 times, and got disconnected every time, after I explained to the rep what I needed. So I called the German phone number +49 - 69 - 86 799 799, on December 5, 2022. The rep reviewed the files and offered to rebook my parents' tickets. We spend over an hour on the phone (and got a message from AT&T phone company that I just got charged $200 for the long distance call). The rep gives me a new booking code. She took my credit card number and said I would be charged $41.23 for tax, and $150 for rebooking, for either of my parents. I agreed to these terms. The rep gave me the new booking code. I checked on the website, and the code was on the LH booking site. Two days later I checked again, and the code was no longer there. I called +49 - 69 - 86 799 799 again. Asked a different rep why the code disappeared from the LH website. The rep checked, and said it was because those flights were no longer available (nobody let me know that! Imagine my parents going to the airport on the day of, and find no seats on the plane!). She offered to rebook to ‘available’ dates. Took my credit card information, told me that I would be charged $41.27 for either parent, the booking code would stay the same, and now we’re supposedly confirmed. I received an email from Lufthansa with confirmation. However, the email also said to “Please call back your Lufthansa Service Center”. I smelled a problem again! I called Lufthansa, spoke to a rep, who checked the booking, and she assured me that everything was in order. I also checked the website, and the booking showed. Two days later, IT DISAPPEARED AGAIN! I tried for the last time, on December 21, 2022. The LH rep said that the previous booking didn’t go for ticketing (no explanation provided!).

The next day by some luck, I got on the flight to Madrid which was at 10.15am. Due to delays, the flight left at 1pm.

We booked our flights based on price more than anything else, so we weren't expecting a great deal. Boarding was straightforward and not delayed. The A340 had a 2-4-2 configuration, and one of the crew had whispered to me ""the flight is empty, once we say boarding completed, grab yourself a row for sleeping""; unfortunately, the couple in front of me decided they would have a row each, so my wife and I had to settle for a pair of seats each. Compared to the Singapore A350, the Lufthansa plane was showing its age, though it was fairly clean and tidy, but the toilets in particular had seen better days. We were served dinner soon after departure, which was a hot meal, there wasn't anything else on offer, and anything between that and breakfast had to be purchased, which I did not expect from a full service carrier. That said, one of the cabin crew pointed this out and suggested I may need more than one beer for the 14 hour flight, so placed 2 spares in my seat pocket.

Absolutely appalling lack of communication from on-ground and central customer service, with each customer service agent either not replying at all or contradicting their colleagues. Trying to claim for any kind of compensation has been a nightmare (despite assurance from the ground staff at the time) and I'm not holding out any hope.

My first flight got delayed and I missed the connecting flight. All of this was Lufthansa's fault not mine. I had to stay at Munich airport for 4 hours straight in a line for the customer service desk so I can be rebooked. The people at the line were crying because we all have different final destinations, no one seemed to care. I was with my dog (Pomeranian) that travelled with me in the cabin. I tried to explain that because there is not a pet relief area I can't stay for hours and hours at the line - they didn't care. There were people with small children that explained the same thing - they didn't care. Finally after a horrific wait I was booked on another flight to Frankfurt and from there I had to go to Sofia.

I ran through the airport because they didn't offer transportation to the gate even though all the delays are their fault, and let me tell you that there were no severe weather conditions or any complications of that sort. Their disorganization and lack of communication led to this absolutely awful journey. Years back I travelled with Lufthansa and I can tell that they had top performance.

The shorter flight was perhaps a third full and the flight attendants were polite and professional. They gave us water and a little chocolate. which I thought fine for the flight time of 1h30. Boarding in Bristol is by walking to the plane, and disembarking by bus in Frankfurt, both seemed well organised and with no delays. Upon arrival, the walk through Frankfurt Airport from the bus gates to the Z gates was well-signed and with no need to go through security again. The flight between Frankfurt and Singapore was delayed by an hour. Being a 747 on a busy route, the flight was full but boarding was quite fast with their automatic gates. The seats in economy are smallish but fine for anyone under 6ft. The flight attendants were again polite, professional and had ready smiles. The IFE system had a wide choice of films but was somewhat slow to use, and the Wifi wasn't working on this flight. There was a choice of supper (vegetarian pasta or chicken teriyaki) along with wine, beer or soft drinks. Unlike Singapore Airlines, the crew didn't walk around with drink trays in the middle of the night, so the next meal/drink was a breakfast (cheese and sundried tomato sandwich, yoghurt and the little chocolate).

There was absolutely no consideration to me or my preferred seat selection. On arrival at Funchal Airport I was also informed that there is no lounge.

If you're by the window, then the person next to you, when they recline all the way, there is absolutely no way to get out - their legs are too high for you to climb over, so if you need to go to the loo, you have to wake them, get them to sit up so you can get out, then they have to wait for you to come back before they can settle down again. The little bag of goodies contained a couple of tiny tubes of moisturizer - no earplugs, no eye mask . And when we got to Munich for the connection, we had to climb down 6 flights of stairs, onto a bus, be driven out to the plane, climb up another flight of steps.

Sometimes you have to drive to the nearest airport to rebook your flight, and this in the most expensive fare classes Economy and Business Flex. No apologies ever. Add to this the ridiculously high fares and you have a wannabe premium airline with a sub-par service which is often below the standards of Ryanair, Easyjet, Vueling or other low cost carriers.

I have now in effect paid twice for my family to fly home. What makes this all the more frustrating, is that despite completing numerous “Customer Feedback forms” on the Lufthansa website, no one is responding to my queries and if any response is received it is an automated one. I have attempted three times to speak with a customer services representative and on every occasion they state that the “refunds department” is dealing with the request. At no point have I been able to speak to the refunds department and at this stage I believe Lufthansa to not be honouring the refund and frustrating my ever attempt to receive clarity on the situation in an effort to deter me from pursuing further.

When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline. In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind “unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect” - this was well below “does not meet expectations”. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we’d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I’m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. We’re going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are. I can only hope they uphold THEIR side of the agreement and get us to our destination. If you as an airline or business cannot uphold your end of the agreement, and continuously fail to meet the agreement, then it is my opinion that refunds should be provided.

It stayed here for another two hours due to weather conditions (which happens) what was not acceptable however, was not providing any food. By this point my children hadn't eaten since midday and it was now 9pm. It then finally arrived at Munich at 2230 and we disembarked at 2300. Told to head to the service desk to see what was next, especially since a lot of people including us had missed their connection flight. The queue was huge and the very helpful help desk closed at 0000 before most people could get any information. A tannoy announcement came over saying they could not provide any hotels, but people could either get a hotel and then claim it back or were welcome to stay at the airport, on the floor, and check on the flights at 0600 the next day. No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge! To make things worse it was outside in the snow, and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers, as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this, as previously mentioned, the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away, but that was a task for tomorrow. That morning I discovered that I had in fact been kicked off that re-booking. According to the app I had now reached my final destination and so the seats were now vacant and booked by someone else.

So me and my family had to spend another day in mid winter with no warm clothing. Luckily the there was no issues with the next flight, except that our laggage was temporarily missplaced.

Then, I told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit. He just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage, claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg (which is a cheap lie according to the official website of Lufthansa) and everyone has done the same here. That is rudeness at a different level, I've never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically (1st time flying with Lufthansa though, maybe that's the problem here). He also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat, that sounded so ridiculous. All in all, instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort (without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight), the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft! I have NEVER seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights I've been present. To the contrary, all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting. I will certainly never use Lufthansa again, it was the first and last time I did and I would discourage anyone using this airline that does not care about customer service at all!",Economy Class,3,1,1,,2,no,2201,,Business,Munich to Hamburg,May 2023,2,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2023-05-05,"""suitcase was no where to be found""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  If you are ever promised to be reimbursed for expenses when they lose your luggage, don’t ever count on it.  My two kids and I flew to Germany several months ago. When we arrived in Berlin, my suitcase was no where to be found. I stood in line for over an hour. When I finally reached the front, I was told the bags were normally located within a day. They promised they would “do what they could” and that I would be reimbursed for any expenses that were incurred. The documents they handed me stated the same. The next day: no bag. I continued to check the website, call and email. No response. The website for lost luggage just stated it was still missing. We left and stopped at several second hand stores to find cheap clothes and other necessities, including a small suitcase and toiletries. I thought I did pretty well and kept the cost under $500.00. EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER We were in Munich when I received an email notifying me the suitcase was in Berlin. The email had a phone number to call with any questions or concerns. No response to emails. Phone calls bounced through automated systems like a pinball. I selected every option throughout the entire system and never reached a live person. Two weeks later we arrived back in Berlin where we would stay for two more days before flying home. I went to the airport to finally retrieve the luggage. I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: “You can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receipt”. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information. Six weeks later, I received another email requesting my ticket information and address. I sent the information back again with the message about a third time After two more months I received a final email: “Thank you for your feedback We sincerely apologize for the unintentional delay in responding to you. As Per your email, we regret to hear that your baggage was delayed at your destination. We can imagine what it meant for you to travel and not have your essential items as you intended.

2023-05-11,"""horrible April Fools trick""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  
My family and I were so excited to visit Venice for the first time, and booked an April 1 departure flight from Hong Kong though Frankfurt with Lufthansa.  Firstly, they canceled my outbound flight just a few days before without automatically rebooking me on an equivalent flight (incredibly, they just removed the segment from my itinerary), with just a discrete email sent to me. I felt myself lucky that I checked my email a day before going to the airport and realized what had happened. As their on-line rebooking system was completely useless (ie. they had simply removed the cancel flight segment without a trace from my itinerary, and so the on-line system could not even find it to rebook.). After 30 minutes of frustration with their useless chatbot, I called into their customer service line, and then the next 90 minutes of pain really started. I tried both their local HK and German hot lines, with a reasonable wait each time, but each time a few minutes into the call, the line would simply cut off. This happened whenever they put me on hold, and sometimes at other random times also. After trying both mobile and land lines at my end, I realized this was probably Lufthansa's IT system issue which the agents seem obvious to. In the next calls, I had to beg the agent to call me back if the line dropped so that they could complete the rebooking transaction. None did for about 10 tries! The Asia-line call center was particularly horrible, as the agent was incredibly rude and evasive, trying to argue immediately that Lufthansa had no responsibility to handle the case as the original ticket as booked through an on-line agent (I booked through Booking.com, whom I had already call. They indicated the Airline was the only one who could make the booking change). Incredibly the agent spent about 3 minutes tried to find every opportunity to evade instead of just solving the problem, and eventually the line dropped (or perhaps he just hung up on me!). Incredible that Lufthansa hires people like this for customer service.  That night, after nearly 90 minutes of trying, I finally got someone on the German call center who was kind enough to call be back after the system dropped the call. She said she rebooked me on a KLM flight that departed half a day earlier and despite the horrible experience, I thought I was saved! Next day, a Friday, my family (4 of us) rushed to the airport to catch the new flight. We had to pull both of our kids out of school a few hours early, and I left work early as the new flight departed mid-day Friday, instead of the original we booked which was early AM Saturday, just after midnight. We didn't realized the horrible April Fools trick Lufthansa has played on us until we reached the KLM check in counter. With 2 hours before flight departure, the counter agent informed us that Lufthansa has incorrectly rebooked the flight with wrong ticket numbers and we could not get on the flight.",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,2205,A340,Family Leisure,Hong Kong to Venice via Frankfurt,April 2023,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
2023-05-11,"""I expected much better treatment""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  
I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline's customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem, we received no information about the status of our bags, and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully, a service agent who overheard our conversation, and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore, Lufthansa's reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100% of the toiletry items and 50% of the clothing, we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th, we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts, which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise, two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead, we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions. Although the flight attendants offered to compensate us for the damaged seat, they changed their minds three times,  For the high price of a business class ticket, I expected much better treatment and a more comfortable experience.

2023-05-26,"""they have practised cost cutting""",2,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lufthansa used to be a very good airline but in recent years they have practised cost cutting to a level that impacted customer experience, food and service quality and is simply not acceptable anymore for a flag carrier. I had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so Lufthansa flights. There seem to be barely any LH flights that leave and arrive on time. In the last week, I took five LH flights and every single one of them was delayed. At this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. So, we finally took off 40 mins late. I specifically booked a seat in the first row because I have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that LH changed my seat and I was bumped back a few rows. As there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more “important” than I which is not a good feeling. (I would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) So much about recognising loyalty which doesn’t seem to have a significant role in Lufthansa’s playbook anymore. Food portions were so small that I thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. Over the last years the food at LH got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. The food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). Being German myself, I do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but I just don’t see why people of cultural backgrounds other the German would eat this. I suppose the food in Business was not worth more than about 3 Euros. There is no free food or drink service in Economy at all, The only thing Lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). So, here’s the “verdict”: With Lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. There is no free food or drink service in Exonomy Class Loyalty recognition is non-existent. Food is terrible and comes in “appetiser” portions only. I can’t see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)",Business Class,1,2,1,,1,no,2220,A321-200,Business,Munich to Catania,May 2023,1,,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany
