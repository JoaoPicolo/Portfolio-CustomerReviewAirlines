2013-01-22,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,London Heathrow to Melbourne via Guangzhou. Leg from London to China was on a new plane with seat back screens attentive and helpful staff. The meals are bizarre - my favourite was the meal of hot spicy beef noodles served with croissant and jam. Leg between China and Melbourne is a much older plane with TV screens showing the same 2 films on loop. Staff on this leg were much more abrupt and less eager to help. Loo's got very horrible on this leg. The seat comfort and size (economy) were same as any other long haul cattle class. For the price we were expecting far worse but to save a pound or two (or three hundred in fact) this was not a bad experience.,Economy Class,4,3,4,3,5,yes,1,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-01-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Flight from Melbourne to Guangzhou China had no TV an older plane and bad leg room. Transfer to Paris with same airline had newer planes with TV comfortable seat and better leg room. Likewise on the way back. Beside the airline I will never do a stop over through China at any cost.,Economy Class,1,3,3,N/A,1,no,2,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-01-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Melbourne to Dhaka via Guangzhou (return). Have flown to Bangladesh on every possible airline but China Southern is my new favourite. Pleasantly surprised by all aspects - service food etc and $500 cheaper than the others. By far best connections too (2hrs outbound 3 hrs return).,Economy Class,4,4,5,3,5,yes,3,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-01-31,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,SYD-CAN-CDG return January 2013. Flew Premium economy and you get what you paid for. These flights were $800 per person less than QF economy. CZ websites states you will get 40% additional leg room which was true. Superior cabin service (noise cancelling headsets blanket pillow fruit and premium wines was false. Superior Amenity Kit - true exclusive check in - true extra baggage allowance - true. Entertainment SYD-CAN-SYD - no entertainment on A330-200. CAN-CDG-CAN - on demand good choice and family friendly A330-300. Meals - Plentiful and filling and better than most. Premium Cabin was half full and before take off we spread out we had extra leg room and 2 seats each on 3/4 of the legs.,Premium Economy,4,3,4,2,4,yes,4,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,1-15-13 SHA-SWA Economy. The flight was on time and full. Flight attendants were very friendly and courteous. They even acknowledged the Elite Plus Members by bringing them water in economy. Food served was hot and tasty. Showed a movie in English with subtitles. Even thought it was an outdated aircraft the attendants made up for that.,Economy Class,3,5,4,4,4,yes,5,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-05,China Southern Airlines customer review,,Travelled twice in 4 months with family of 4 from SYD-LHR return due to sick relatives. Chose China Southern purely on cost. Terrible both times never again! Staff surly and unhelpful. Very poor English spoken in economy class service. Inflight entertainment SYD-Guangzhou - no individual screens. Very poor choice of non Asian movies on China-UK legs. Food inedible practically thrown at passengers often no choice available. Service very brusque collected trays a few minutes after giving them out. Even beverages were awful - soft drinks from large bottles warm and no ice available. Very little alcohol tiny glass of wine. Flight from SYD- Guangzhou arrives very early morning in China around 6 am. Terminal very cold with rats running around under the seats! Toilets very dirty and smelt. Very difficult to find out how much in advance for additional bag.,Economy Class,3,1,1,1,2,no,6,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-06,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,1-18-13 SWA to HKG. I have never had a problem taking China Southern. Attendants are friendly courteous and always helping passengers as most of those that fly CZ seem to be first time fliers. As a DL Platinum member I am able to board early. Stow the luggage get my book and sit back and watch the calamity. Passengers even though given a boarding card for a seat choose where ever they like. As the flight fills up those passengers seated in the wrong seats refuse to get up and give the seat to the passenger assigned. Shouting matches shoving and rude gestures usually follow and the calamity goes on. The flight attendants have their hands full and do the best they can. Flights are on time food served is decent drinks are fine and the AVOD on in country flights is usually in English with Subtitles. Attach your noise cancelling head phones and drift off. Pricing is right and the service level is fine.,Economy Class,4,5,4,4,4,yes,7,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,,We travelled from Vancouver Canada to Hanoi Vietnam and back from Phnom Penh Cambodia to Vancouver in January/February 2013 both in transit through Guangzhou. The portions to and from Vietnam/Cambodia from Guangzhou weren't too bad but the flights from Guangzhou from/to Vancouver BC were terrible just like the previous poster Mary Martin said to and from SYD. The attitude of the air hostesses on these routes have to be improved! They practically threw the food tray at passengers.,Economy Class,3,1,1,1,1,no,8,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,LHR-CAN-MEL. The Skyteam lounge at T4 was uncrowded and the food available (at 1900) exemplary. Not too sure this would be the case at KLM/AF rush hour though. A330 Business seats are fully flat to CAN and the meals are excellent. Service albeit with language difficulties were friendly and helpful. The problem arises at Guangzhou if you are in transit. One has to enter China in Immigration terms which can be a lengthy process. They must have lessons on this from Miami Airport where I will never ever transit again. If you are in Business the Ground staff ensure you are met on arrival of the aircraft and shepherd you though to the Business Lounge. Next sector to Melbourne same aircraft but slide flat seats the service level and meals still fine. Media ok if you like Hollywood blockbusters I just slept all the way.,Business Class,4,5,4,3,5,yes,9,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,18 December 2012 Amsterdam to Shanghai. I fly frequently with China Southern. The price is always good and the flights are on time. Attendants are polite. Although I was bit late for boarding they gave me very good guidance in the cabin. Since the overhead bin was full around my seat they helped me put my hand luggage in their special overhead bins and let me know where they put it after the takeoff. The attendants walked around offering drinks and helping with blankets while most passengers slept. The inflight entertainment system was not that good in comparison. The movies are not up-to-date. For such a long flight I think the entertainment system is important. I recommend China Southern for its value of money and good service from attendants.,Economy Class,4,5,4,3,4,yes,10,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Shenyang to Beijing then Beijing to Amsterdam. The crew were kind and helpful. I was impressed by the way they treated the economy class passengers. However the inflight entertainment was not that great. I will fly with them in the future.,Economy Class,4,5,3,3,4,yes,11,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-25,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Flew Sydney-Guangzhou-Paris-Madrid-Amsterdam-Guangzhou-Sydney late last year predominately with China Southern but with an occasional flight with partners. Incredibly cheap you do however get what you pay for in many ways. It really is a back to basics airline. Most flights did not have individual TV screens but only overhead screens although they did play pretty good movies. Seats surprisingly comfortable and somewhat better leg room than other long haul economy. Food basic yet tasty and quite palatable. The staff are overwhelmingly Chinese but skills in European languages (or at least English and French) are quite basic enough to get the drink you want but a woman near me seemed to find it quite hard to communicate her query about transfers in Guangzhou. Altogether I'd say the trade offs are well worth the price savings to be made a good but basic experience for a great price.,Economy Class,4,3,3,2,5,yes,12,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-02-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,I must give praise to China Southern Airlines. CZ351 from CAN to MEL spacious aircraft was very welcoming. The flight crew's superb service food and drinks made the trip enjoyable. China Southern Airlines is highly recommended.,Economy Class,4,5,5,4,5,yes,13,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-03-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Guangzhou to Qingdao flight delayed about 45 minutes due to military exercise. Cabin crew professional service on board comfortable travel at a great price. Especially food delicious noodle. The entertainment facilities are poor.,Economy Class,4,4,5,3,5,yes,14,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-03-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,,Auckland-Beijing-Guangzhou-Amsterdam return. Aircraft was very nice the cabin crew although with very limited English were polite and helpful the Ground support was atrocious as was the communication between CS and the passengers re: timing giving instructions and advising the delay of flights. We were delayed missed a connection were flying business class and ended up sleeping in a terminal in Amsterdam we had no idea the flight was late until we arrived at the next check in gate. Had left 1.5 hours between flights - not enough. On the return luckily we arrived at the airport 2 hours before departure it took 1 hr 45 mins to get the boarding passes. We were advised that we needed a VISA for Australia although were only transiting 45 mins in Melbourne. This took 1 hr 45mins to resolve.,Business Class,5,3,5,4,2,no,15,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-03-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,I have flown China Southern twice now to Nanning from Brisbane I was happy with the service and the international flights but twice now on leaving Nanning they change the return flight times - very frustrating. I had booked premium economy and ended up in economy for the flight to Guangzhou. If I had not had local help I don't know what the outcome would have been. I like the airline but their chopping and changing is a nightmare for the international traveler.,Premium Economy,4,4,4,1,5,yes,16,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-03-18,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Osaka (Kansai) to Guangzhou (Baiyun). Airbus A321 from Osaka to China in business class. A smaller plane with older type business class seats but very comfortable for a short international flight of under 4 hours. Flight attendants were polite and the food was excellent. Guangzhou (Baiyun) to Auckland. Airbus A330 from China to Auckland in business class. Superb flat reclining seats (not angled like many other airlines). Nice thick blanket and fluffy pillow. I could get a great nights sleep on this overnight flight to New Zealand. Dinner and breakfast served. Both of which were were delicious. Flight attendants excellent. Their business class fares from Japan were very cheap and I definitely got my money's worth. The China Southern lounge in Guangzhou was nice. Food drinks and seating were all up to scratch.,Business Class,5,4,4,4,4,yes,17,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-03-21,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,HAK—CAN—MEL economy. I have flown China Southern twice and knew their seat was a little narrow and uncomfortable. When I arrived the check-in counter I told the staff that I want a front seat and special meal in my flights. I could not believe that I got the first row aisle seat and successfully booked my special meal. If they can maintain the level of their service as this time I will continue to fly with them in the future!,Economy Class,3,4,3,4,4,yes,18,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-03-22,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Business class to Singapore from LAX. My recommendation is to select even number rows to avoid being disturbed by people passing by. The seats are poorly designed and obvious wasted space for reading materials should have been used for added comfort for the passenger. The extra pillow can be used to soften the side area and asking for an extra blanket can add softness to the hard seat. The video selection is limited and food selection is poor. The stewardess did not appear to have a working system and my partner received her food much later than us. We booked mainly because of the price and have decided to pay the extra money for now on to get the quality we want. We will not use China Southern based on lack of comfort and poor food quality.,Business Class,2,3,2,3,3,no,19,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2013-03-25,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,Shenzhen to Beijing. When it looked like a delay was possible they arranged for us to move to another gate where a back-up plane was ready. I was greeted by name by flight attendants. One even stopped to give me a small Chinese lesson so I could order my food in Chinese! I found the food simple but delicious. At check-in a young lady directed me from the general area to a special lane for Sky Priority members which I had forgotten. The check-in was very fast and there is a special line for security as well which was nice.,Economy Class,4,5,5,4,5,yes,21,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2013-03-27,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Shenzhen to Taipei. At airport check-in and security-check was fast the international terminal is small but nice. All flights were boarded by shuttle bus. The plane was an A321 and the premium economy class is good. Perfect legroom and helpful staff. Food is pretty good but there is seldom choice for drinks.,Premium Economy,4,4,4,4,4,yes,24,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-04-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Shenzhen to Shanghai. Check in at Shenzhen smooth as usual friendly and efficient. Lounge is available and acceptable. Hot Food and Drinks as well as wifi and English Newspapers. Flight was delayed due to ATC in Shanghai. No announcements in English even though half of the flight were westerners. Once on board the seat was like a rock. Not comfortable at all but at the end of a long week I just wanted to get to Shanghai. Flight attendant provided great service food choices were good and filled the void. Drinks and dessert were of good calibre. Good value for the money for flights in China.,First Class,1,5,4,3,4,yes,25,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-04-02,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,Flew MEL - CAN - KTM return. As per previous reviews CZ lacks inflight entertainment. Took IPad with movies so no problem. Overall service was good food is a little bland however flight attendants were relatively attentive with plenty of drinks on offer particularly warm water(?). Flights were all on time and planes were relatively new.,Economy Class,4,3,3,3,4,yes,26,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-04-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,Premium Economy from CAN to AKL return. Leg room in PE cabin is more than adequate. As both flights are over-night flights (more than 11 hours flying time) extra leg room can make your journey a lot more comfortable. Check-in in CAN is a bit chaotic as CZ did not use the air-bridge. However in AKL it was much nicer and organised. Priority boarding offered to PE customers. Average IFE (Limited choices of English movies and the selections are not on par with SQ CX NZ and the like. However the system is more than adequate for a Chinese-speaking traveller as the choices for him/her are sufficient). Catering onboard is acceptable. No English announcement from the Captain/First Officer. English skills of the cabin crew need to be improved. Overall two pleasant flights with relatively cheap price. I would recommend CZ if the quality of IFE is not on your top list when you travel.,Premium Economy,4,3,3,3,4,yes,27,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2013-04-16,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,CAN-CDG and LHR-CAN in Business Class. CAN-CDG on an A330-200 not new but properly managed. Business class seats are not fully lie flat but angled flat beds and a bit small to me. When I boarded the cabin crew greeted me. Service was attentive and they kept refilling my glass. I reserved a special meal and it was good. As we all know the in-flight entertainment of CZ isn't that impressive but I have my Pad. Good Skyteam transit experience in CDG for my connecting flight to CPH but the AF lounge was packed! LHR-CAN on another A330-200. Not full again so it was another quiet trip food was good and service was still great. Again return from China to Europe (including a round trip ticket to CPH) in business is the cheapest ticket I can get CZ might not offer fancy in-flight entertainment nor great food like CX or TK but they offer you a comfortable seat with great attentive service. I will definitely travel with CZ again in future.,Business Class,5,5,4,4,5,yes,29,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-04-17,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Shenyang to Guangzhou and Guangzhou to Sydney February 2013. Overall excellent value for money. Flights were on time along with my bags food good and service attentive although English language not always good. IFE poor. Transfer in Guangzhou not that easy: Outbound took 2.5 hrs to get short stay permit to transit for 19 hrs but then taken to Pullman Hotel which was great. Return flight permit no problem but transit hotel was Good East which was dreadful so spent most of the time in the business lounge which was good. Seats spacious and comfortable - converts to flat bed.,Economy Class,4,4,3,3,4,yes,30,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-04-21,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,The ground staff were very attentive at YVR Vancouver airport. YVR-CAN-PER went very well. The lounge at YVR was okay as was food. Boarding efficient. Chief Purser in flight was also very friendly attentive and patient on board.,Business Class,3,5,4,4,4,yes,31,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-04-22,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Flew Sydney to Guangzhou return in economy. Flight leaving Sydney and Guangzhou about 30 mins late. Food was notably better out of Sydney (OK) than Guangzhou (Terrible). However both ways the food was not hot (just lukewarm). Out of Sydney the hostess served me coffee in a plastic cup rather than in the coffee cup on the tray (odd). It appears on flights to and from Australia they have employed 1 native English speaker as cabin crew. The cabin crew friendly and reasonably efficient. The cabin (A330) was not well maintained. My seat on the return leg to Sydney was broken and the bathrooms were the dirtiest I've seen on my travels. Entertainment is very limited (bring your own). While my review appears mostly negative I think they do offer value for money.,Economy Class,3,3,2,2,4,yes,32,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-04-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,LHR-CAN-AKL. Flew both directions Business Class in March 2013. New A330s with flat bed. All flights were extremely comfortable and landed ahead of schedule. As 3 flights were overnight I didn't bother with the IFE too much. Bed was comfortable so I slept most of the time. Disappointed the in-flight map only worked on LHR-CAN flight but that's just something I like. Staff were very courteous and I didn't experience any particular language problem. Food was plentiful. After a couple of flights it was easy to pick and choose the courses you wanted. Service in Guangzhou in both directions was great. I was met at the door of the plane by airport staff marched through transit and within ten minutes was sat in the business lounge which I found pleasant and uncrowded. Plenty of relaxing chairs. I will definitely use them for the Australia/New Zealand run again just for the out and out comfort of the seat/bed alone not forgetting the unbeatable price.,Business Class,5,4,3,3,5,yes,33,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-04-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,Two flights - Tokyo to Guangzhou and Guangzhou to Sydney. Although limited movies this was easily overcome by bringing an ipad. The food was equivalent to airline food pleasant but not great. The staff were very helpful and courteous at all times. I would book again.,Economy Class,5,5,4,4,5,yes,34,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-05,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,One of many business class trips made on China Southern. I must say that the seats on business class are of old design and not as comfortable as some newer designs since it cannot go to 180 degree as yet. The cabin crews were friendly as usual but you can also sense some are really inexperienced. Overall all my flights total 4 of them being Melbourne - Guangzhou Guangzhou - Beijing Beijing - Guangzhou and Guangzhou - Melbourne were all on time. I was happy with the experience.,Business Class,3,5,4,3,4,yes,35,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-10,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,Round trip Melbourne - Guangzhou - Melbourne. Leg room is good. However service is bad. The airplane equipped with some big screen TV (not individual LCD like other airlines) with no sound and you have no choice but to watch their chosen programs. However on my trips the TV was not working. When we complained to stewardess she acknowledged the problem but did nothing to fix it. Not even an apology. No music channels provided. On the food front if you are Asian then you will get either rice or noodle automatically (unless you complain and request Western food). It also the only airline serves beverages that are not chilled. Even beer is warm. I don't think I'll fly with them again.,Economy Class,3,1,1,1,2,no,36,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-12,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Domestic flight in China from Harbin to Beijing. Booked the ticket at noon on the day of departure. I still got 20% off the price. The service was ok the dinner was awful as usual. Chicken rice and beef noodle. Airbus A320 is kind of new but it has no individual entertainment system just a few common used televisions over our heads. Barely nobody watch that. The whole flight was average.,Economy Class,3,3,3,2,2,yes,37,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-13,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Xian to Chengdu 11 May. Nice modern 737. There was a delay of over 30 minutes. They served some water and a small sandwich while we waited. Once the aircraft departed there was no service at all. Most of the staff stayed seated until the plane was due to land. There was no food or drink served. Not even water. Not really good enough for a 4 star airline.,Economy Class,3,3,2,2,3,no,38,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-13,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,Taipei To Guilin 1 May. The service was quite good as was the meal although it was quite small.

2013-05-15,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Travelled recently Auckland-Guangzhou-London return. While this trip was very competitively priced and we were quite happy with the level of seat/bed comfort we were disappointed with the English language skills of the cabin crew who were very willing to be of service but often simply couldn't understand us. The meals were interesting and generous in quantity but there was virtually no choice of alcohol with our dinner and it wasn't offered until we asked. There also seemed to be no comprehension of a simple western breakfast: muesli yoghurt fruit and a hot cup of tea or coffee. But our biggest complaint was that on the leg from Guangzhou to Auckland the business class cabin was full of men who coughed burped snored sniffed and hoiked into their napkins to the extent that even with ear plugs firmly in place we could not sleep. Dreadful.,Business Class,4,4,3,2,3,no,42,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

We chose CS because of their very competitive price and were delighted. Modern well equipped planes polite professional staff and decent food. The icing on our cake was our 7 hour interconnection at Guangzhou when we were offered use of the Business Class lounge with comfy chairs warm showers excellent food and quality (Chinese) wine - all for free! We've flown LHR to AUK many times and this was easily our best experience. We shall most certainly fly China Southern again.,Economy Class,4,5,5,3,5,yes,44,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-19,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,LHR-PER May 2013. Booked CZ as they were GBP 200 cheaper than other airlines. Was worried after some of the reviews I read but the experience was good overall. All flights arrived on time. New airbus A330-200 on all legs. AVOD system pretty good enough to keep me entertained without getting out my iPad. Food was standard airline meals - in economy its never going to be amazing but was sufficient. Seats comfortable enough. Crew sometimes slow to respond to attention calls but plenty of self serve drinks at rear of plane. Transit at CAN is not the headache some reviewers make it out to be. Plenty of CZ ground staff there to help. Overnight stop in Guangzhou on return CZ provide accommodation for transit over 8 hours. Good 4 star hotel with buffet breakfast. For the price I'd definitely use them again only complaints are drinking water on board aircraft was always warm and some announcements were hard to understand.,Economy Class,4,3,3,3,5,yes,45,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

The seats had a footrest but no headrest. No back seat screen recently released films were shown on drop down screens throughout the cabin. Great service by friendly and efficient flight attendants. Food was good and plentiful drinks were served cold and ice was available. All in all I was very impressed with China Southern and would definitely fly with them again.,Economy Class,4,5,4,N/A,5,yes,47,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-23,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,Flew last month from Dubai to Manila via Guangzhou (return). Amongst all other airlines flying from Dubai to Manila China Southern Airlines offered the cheapest ticket at that time. Flight attendants were like robots. It's as if they were not interested or happy with what they were doing. Some were a bit rude. They were always in a hurry to serve food. The blanket offered to us on our flight from Dubai to Guangzhou was not sealed in plastic I felt it was the same blanket that was used by the passengers from the previous flight. Overall you get what you pay for. Cheap ticket equals cheap and substandard service. I will never fly with this airline again unless I really have no choice.,Economy Class,3,1,3,1,3,no,48,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-27,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,Flight CZ321 from Guangzhou to Melbourne on 13th of May. My first time choosing a business class seat. The flight took off on time without any delay arrived in Melbourne 10 minutes early. Flight attendants were kind and very helpful and provided meticulous service. With the help of the earplugs I fell to sleep quickly on the comfortable seat. Dinner and breakfast delicious. They also provided a wide selection of entertainment. Good value for money.,Business Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,49,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-05-27,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,Travelled in Economy class from Delhi to Los Angeles on 24th. May2013 by CZ-3028/CZ-328. Indian Vegetarian meals provided did not include bread and one had to ask for it though butter was part of meal. There was no choice of alcohol. Further though I had booked seats 2 months in advance I was not given a choice of seats. There should be some consideration for Senior Citizens. I had asked for a wheelchair for my wife but was not provided for transfer at Guangzhou airport. Further there was no elevator for passengers arriving by CZ-3028 from Delhi to climb to 1st floor.,Economy Class,2,2,2,3,3,no,50,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2013-05-29,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,Zhengzhou to Bangkok via Guangzhou on 28/05/2013. No whiskey only red and white wine. No food. Chicken mentioned in the menu but no chicken. First I was told that there is no fish also but it suddenly appeared after I made a noise. I asked for a complaint form. Nothing happened for some time. Then the Captain arrives and sits next to me with a sheet of paper saying that I could mention the problem and he would translate into Chinese. I said no and that I would fill it in myself. After some time a red coloured printed sheet was brought out. Cannot understand a word of what is said in English.,Business Class,1,1,1,N/A,1,no,53,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

No apologies we only got a bottle of water and some biscuits. Communication was very bad.

2013-06-02,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Auckland to London and back again. This was very much value for money but I do have a few gripes. I was told that I couldn't sit in the emergency exit seats because I don't speak Mandarin but I did see plenty of what appeared to be native English speakers in the seats when the plane took off. I'm 6ft 3ins tall and on the Heathrow to Guangzhou leg my knees were up against the seat in front even before the person in front reclined his seat. Anyone over about 5ft 10 needs to ask for seats in rows 41-37 these seats have the same leg room as premium economy without the inflated price. Not much choice for English films and they didn't change on the way back despite the inflight magazine saying that they had. I agree with other people that the staff's level of English is poor this needs to be addressed if they are seeking to get a bigger share of the European market. That said I did have the lounge in China both ways which was great even though I was only flying economy. I have flown with Singapore Malaysia Air New Zealand and Emirates in the past and would certainly use China Southern again if the price was right this time I paid $1800 all in.,Economy Class,2,3,3,1,4,yes,55,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

When we finally arrived we were just in time to see our flight to Sydney take off. China Southern Airways put us in the worst hotel for the night out in the middle of nowhere.

I have flown many times from KUL to HSV almost all airlines except China Southern allow me to check my bags to the final destination all I have to do to is claim the bags at LAX clear customs and then simply drop the bags at the counter after the custom no need to re-check.

Staff very friendly English ok. One flight attendant offered me an English magazine as she saw that I was looking at the Chinese flight magazine. I did not try the food but what I could see looked not too bad. What would you expect from a 2 hour flight on a fare of around 40 Euro? Overall I am satisfied with the service especially on the route Shenzhen-Shanghai and back.

When we finally boarded we sat on the tarmac and when they brought the food carts out we realised we were not going anywhere in a hurry. We finally took off only to arrive in Guangzhou 5 minutes before our connecting flight to Perth was due to depart. China Southern sent us to a hotel for 2 days. When we finally left for Perth we were on a flight that had 45 empty seats in front of us and they would not let us move to be able to have more room.

2013-06-19,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Sydney to Amsterdam via Guangzhou. Almost 800 dollars cheaper than the nearest competitor so can't complain on price. New PTV's were a nice surprise as I had been told there were going to be none. Food ok. Seat on the A330-300 had plenty of leg room so good for me as I'm 6'5. A330-200 leg room not as good but the same as most other airlines. Two biggest takeaways were poor English language skills from flight attendants and being served a glass of black tea with no milk. Strange. But they were on time got me there safely and weren't all that bad for the price. Would go again if was significantly cheaper but not my preferred airline.,Economy Class,3,2,2,3,5,yes,62,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

This occurred after I boarded the aircraft when the pilot announced over the PA system of the delay. There was no confirmation of the next flight except that they said it should depart at least 3 hrs later. Not only was our flight was affected all China Southern Airlines outbound were delayed with their explanation as ""airspace congestion."" Fortunately we departed 1.5hrs later.

Singapore to Guangzhou: pretty small seats no inflight entertainment older aircraft but no serious complaints. Guangzhou to Auckland: pretty good inflight entertainment food is OK seats OK modern aircraft. Excellent on time performance on all flights signifying a pretty efficient operation. There are deficiencies in English with many staff but since at least 90% of passengers were Chinese on every flight it is unreasonable to expect too much. The written English in their publications videos and notices also needs attention. If China Southern wish to increase the percentage of foreign customers however they will need to improve their language skills - in English and in other languages. At the same time there were some staff who spoke excellent English and all staff tried their best to give good service.,Economy Class,4,3,3,4,5,yes,75,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Plane from CAN-LHR however was different and was a standard seat with the minimal expected legroom. Inflight entertainment SYD-CAN was shared screens showing pre- selected English and Chinese language movies. CAN-LHR had individual VOD screens which offered enough variety to keep anyone entertained for the duration of the flight. Cabin crew were helpful but their English wasn't the best. Service was often prompt if a little hurried. Inflight meal was of a decent standard. Drinks available were good but in regards to alcohol not varied beer or wine was the choice available and sometimes a little warm. Overall for the price I can't complain baggage collection was prompt at LHR and transiting through CAN was simple.

Seated beside toilet on all 4 long long legs of the two trips. Constantly knocked by passing staff and queuing passengers. Disgusting food and how could they run out of choice by only Row 41? Staff have a lot to learn about customer service. Seats have adequate leg room but are hard and very narrow with no space for long arms and broad shoulders. Sitting next to a large fellow passenger is intolerably uncomfortable. Delays poor information unintelligible cabin announcements. Guangzhou airport badly needs to sharpen up its act - it is dingy with filthy carpets and equally unpleasant toilets.

Other than priority check in and boarding the seats food service entertainment was identical to economy. As soon as the seat belt lights went off a number of passengers walked into premium and sat down not to be moved. The food was almost inedible and wine undrinkable. Personal entertainment systems were ok but only present for 3/4 legs. The other leg had a shared screen which played half an English language film then two Chinese films whose subtitles could not be read. Seats barely reclined and loud passenger announcements came frequently and spuriously such that sleeping was near impossible. There was very little English spoken and a general reluctance of staff to assist or provide any service above the mandatory meal services. This was my first and last trip on CSA.

No priority boarding but still quick and efficient. Nice clean aircraft. Hot meal (though of poor quality) for this short flight. TPE-CAN: flight cancelled due to typhoon in Taipei. Fair enough. Was told to contact my travel agent to get rebooked as they said they didn't have access to the booking system in TPE. Asked to speak to a China Southern manager and within seconds and thanks to FB Elite membership was escorted by an airline rep to a Hainan airlines agent who got me one of their last seats available to CAN. CAN-CDG: efficient Sky Priority check-in by nice agent who even used her best French. Exit row seat offered. Efficient Sky Priority security line and boarding. Clean modern cabin interior PTVs well groomed flight attendants again. Not very personable but probably due to language/culture barrier. Very little English spoken again.

The food on the flight to Guangzhou was the worst I have had on an airline. In addition very little entertainment was provided to help me kill time over this 12 hour flight. There were only 6 channels of videos. Most were Chinese films with subtitles but the screens were too small for the subtitles to be readable. On the return flight we were delayed several hours leaving Guangzhou but staff didn't explain why.

2013-08-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,I had an Air France ticket from Paris CDG to Melbourne. The second leg of the flight from Guangzhou to Melbourne was operated by China Southern. There were no personal television screens only shared screens which screened movies with illegible English subtitles. The lack of in-flight entertainment made this 9.5 hour flight dull and unpleasant. The food was the worst I have had on an airline: for dinner I chose noodles with beef the beef was a couple of tiny pieces of mince. My partner chose the chicken with rice and although the rice had a nice flavour there was hardly any chicken. The only decent meal on the flight was the omelette and hash brown which I chose for breakfast. The seats were also of a very poor standard. The headrests did not contain the function which allows you to push two flaps inwards in order to stop your head from lolling about when you fall asleep. I have had these adjustable headrests on other economy-class flights including the flight with Air France from Paris to Guangzhou and flights with Etihad Airways and Qantas. In addition the armrests between the seats could not be pushed all the way upwards and consequently my partner and I were unable to lean on each other without hitting our faces on the protruding armrest. The absence of personal in-flight entertainment and the extremely poor quality of the food and the seats compared with other economy-class flights means I won't be flying with China Southern again.,Economy Class,2,3,1,1,3,no,94,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

The food could be improved - one of the meals described as chicken porridge but in fact was chicken congee. The midday meal was very good. Overall a great experience.,Economy Class,4,5,4,3,5,yes,95,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-03,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,Sydney to Amsterdam stopping in Guangzhou. Every stage of our trip resulted in issues - from booking (they changed our itinerary prior to departure). Once flying food quality and choice dreadful staff cannot speak English and don't want to answer your questions. We missed 4 connections in total (none our fault) and trust me on the ground in China with unexpected flight delays is the last place you want to be. Disorganised unprofessional unpleasant. Never again.,Economy Class,2,2,1,3,1,no,96,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Flew LAX to Guangzhou to Sydney in Bus Class. The A380 was only 60% full and was looking a bit tired lots of marks and dings in the trim. Had the lay flat beds and the plane was very quiet slept well. Fare was very good about half of the normal fare I pay for business so I decided to give them a go. Crew were very good food Ok for business as was drink service. My son wanted a Vodka and orange but they didn't carry vodka on board. Cabin crew has basic English language skills only. Met at the gate on arrival in Guangzhou and escorted through the transit process and into the lounge had a shower and lounge was very good. Had a ticketing issue with our Sydney flight as I wanted try and go direct to Perth. The desk staff did all they could to help but it wasn't possible due to schedules. Flight to Perth was in standard throne chairs otherwise no problems plane clean and tidy and food and drinks good. Only bad points was after take off from LAX the crew filled the remaining business class seats with people from other classes no big deal just a large influx banging bags around about an hour into the flight. Our transit time in Guangzhou was 4 hours. Otherwise better than Id expected and if I could time the Perth - China - LAX flights right Id use them again.,Business Class,4,4,4,4,5,yes,97,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,NZ to London (12th Aug 2013) on CZ306 10pm Airbus 332. Got a very cheap flight and wasn't expecting too much. Seating and leg room was good as any other flight I have travelled any announcements made are in Chinese first followed by English have to listen carefully to understand but no big deal. Service I must say is not as good as other flights I have been on but certainly acceptable. No ice with your drinks! Food I have to say is just ok! Both legs of the flights had own personal screens (touch screens) first flight didnt not work and you have to use the remote which is in the seat (which you cant take out) to get the screens to work can be a bit of a pain. 2nd flight it worked every now and again my daughters worked fine so just luck I suppose! I would certainly fly with them again for the price large saving if travelling with a family of four.,Economy Class,4,3,3,4,3,yes,98,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-05,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,Delayed due to bad weather on arriving in Guangzhou. I had a tight connection via Xiamen to Amsterdam for a wedding. Ground staff were great they redirected me directly from Guangzhou to Amsterdam on the first flight - there was a long delay and without asking for it they put us up in a hotel and fed us. Our bags arrived in Amsterdam. They handled the volume of people very well - prioritising correctly and communicating it. The seats on the A330-333 had lots of room (SYD to Guangzhou) the seats on the 737 from Guangzhou to Amsterdam not so good. I didn't eat anything except the fruit and vegies but others said the food was good. We got a 72 hour Chinese Visa with no hassles at all.,Economy Class,4,4,3,3,5,yes,99,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-08,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,I returned last week from China to Australia on a China Southern flight and I chose this flight because it was the only direct flight and getting me over-night back to Sydney. Booking into business as I had a meeting in the morning I prepared myself to have a good sleep. Unfortunately an Asian family of 3 also booked into business. I have 2 young children and we travel overseas a lot so I'm not against children in business just against parents who have not taught their children to use inside voices. Needless to say I arrived in Sydney very tired.,Business Class,3,5,3,3,4,no,100,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-09,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,I flew Sydney - London economy return in June 2013. I was quite satisfied overall. I found the food quite acceptable in fact I mostly enjoyed it. The service was good but with no frills can't complain at the price. Entertainment possibly not so good but I take my own entertainment so not a concern to me. My fellow passengers including small children were all good no problems there. I was as comfortable as it's possible to be in economy. I would recommend China Southern particularly at such a low price.,Economy Class,4,4,4,3,5,yes,101,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-09,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,14-29 August 2013. After reading mostly negative reviews for this airline I felt the need to add my own review. We have recently flown from Perth to Guangzhou return and cannot fault them. Staff were as good as any other airline we have used (as was the food) and the modern plane was a pleasure to travel in. Fantastic value for money (saved us approx $500 each on our journey).,Economy Class,4,4,4,4,5,yes,102,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-10,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,"I often fly with China Southern from Sydney to Guangzhou and back. I cannot help noticing that after 4 years of complaining about the state of the toilets ""inflight"" now finally I am seeing that crew members are allocated to frequently cleaning the toilets and allowing them to look and even smell decent. Its not a nice subject to discuss but needs continued attention and supervision. On a friendlier subject ""Food"". It is difficult to please everyone but on the whole I cannot help noticing that the quality of food chosen by China Southern on the flights to OZ has increased just in this last 2 months. Still maybe to early to tell and maybe just a blip on the radar but I do notice things - service of ""ice cubes"" with drinks offered? Serving of better quality food in flight meals. I.e. good quality chocolate used in cakes etc. CZ326 dated 10th Sep 2013.",Economy Class,3,5,4,3,4,yes,103,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-09-11,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,Economy Class SYD-AMS with a stop in Guangzhou. We were very pleasantly surprised with how the trip turned out. As we were checking in we were told we could actually check in 2 bags each making a total of 42kgs per person. Onboard we saw that we had our own personal inflight entertainment systems. Had them on all 4 flights there and back. Service was good food was just like all other airlines. No problems at all. First flight back from Amsterdam was on the new A380. The tray table was too far away from me but had plenty of leg room. For the amount we paid and what we got in return they deserve to take business away from other major airlines.,Economy Class,5,4,4,5,5,yes,104,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

All flights were on Airbus 330-200 with the latest lie flat seats Staff were pretty efficient although English not great but then my Chinese is non existent! Aircraft's were new and in good condition toilets clean etc. Staff at the halfway mark there to guide us through and Business Class lounge in China is pretty good with OK food although the showers were out of order on return trip which was a pain as there is a six hour stopover on the return leg. My first excursion on Business class and at only $4200 nz it was well worth it! Would not hesitate to use this airline again. All flights were on time or early.

2013-09-16,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,We recently returned from the long haul flight from Australia to London on China Southern. Overall I would recommend China Southern to others but it would not go without a warning about the customer service. At times it may just be a message lost in translation but I got the impression the staff did not enjoy serving patrons and were quite unfriendly especially to English speaking persons. Often felt that I was putting the staff out if I asked for a drink or something.,Economy Class,3,2,2,4,3,yes,109,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Flight from China to Melbourne male staff members were rude wouldn't give choice on food just put it on your table when asked what choices there were were told that is it. The female attendants took over and supplied the different choices. The toilets were a disgrace soap had run out and not kept clean.

2013-09-25,China Southern Airlines customer review,,I was booked to fly Sydney to Amsterdam last month via Guangzhou and Beijing with admittedly tight connections but travel.com who I booked through assured me they would be ok so imagine my concerns when I arrived at Sydney Airport to find the first leg was already delayed by one hour which in turn resulted in my missing the Guangzhou to Beijing Beijing to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to Birmingham connections (the latter I'd booked through KLM). The most frustrating part of this whole saga was finding someone at Guangzhou and Beijing Airports who could speak proper English and explain to me what was happening they put me and a few others up in a hotel in Beijing and collected us at 6am the following morning. Then had to hang about for a few hours to see if I could be transferred to a KLM flight leaving later that morning what a relief when I got a seat on that plane and all the flight attendants spoke English and with a smile! I missed my connection to Birmingham and had to pay again and eventually arrived in Birmingham some 12 hours late. The biggest problem I found was the lack of English spoken which surprised me but the service generally on all China Southern flights was poor with hardly a smile from anyone plus the food was very ordinary beer and white wine came warm the entertainment unit was not working on the first leg and although available on the next leg was nearly all Chinese. Flight information was non existent and we were never told what the local time was as we arrived at each Airport.,Economy Class,3,2,2,1,1,no,115,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

As value for money unbeatable less than the premium economy of other airlines by a considerable margin.

If you want extensive wine lists and Michelin-starred food maybe you will try another airline but food is adequate and staff attentive.

When it came time for aperitifs to be served I asked for a tonic gin as usual which was refused as they do not offer this. Nothing was served with the drink. I asked then for red wine as aperitif. It was served half a cup of wine. About 50 minutes later the meal was miserably served. About 30 minutes after the food the dinner drinks came. Breakfast before arrival at Amsterdam composed of again chicken noodles. Later some kind of bread but nothing to put in it not even a small packet of cheap butter. During the night service nothing but water no coffee available. It has been the worst flight I had with a disgusting service.,Economy Class,3,1,1,3,1,no,120,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

The ground service at PEK was quite good the plane was large and boarding was done in an orderly manner better than other previous CZ experiences. Staff were good and helped passengers when in need.

2013-10-13,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,Having read some of the reviews here I was a little hesitant about flying with China Southern. Flew SYD-CDG then CDG-SYD with a stopover in Guangzhou. We were very pleased with the level of service with China Southern. All flights were on time and the aircraft were fairly new. Meals were adequate although some combinations of food were a little odd. Drinks were plentiful although you did have to keep asking for them. In flight entertainment was adequate and a fairly good range of options in English. The toilets on the plane were regularly cleaned and the attendants made sure that they were well stocked. Would I fly with this airline again yes especially for the price that I paid. Transit at Guangzhou was a breeze with ground staff on hand to direct passengers.,Economy Class,4,4,4,4,5,yes,122,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-10-20,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,We flew Vancouver to Guangzhou and then to Kathmandu. The first leg was an old plane. Our overhead lights wouldn't turn off. The video on the seat in front had only one English language film and the picture quality was poor. Service was nothing to write home about nor was the food. We left 2.5 hours late which meant a rushed transfer in Guangzhou. The second flight to Kathmandu was better on time and a newer plane. However several passengers (including us) had to wait a nervous day for our luggage to arrive on the next flight. Luckily it did but could have been a real hassle as we had travel plans in Nepal the day after the luggage arrived. Yes the fares are cheap but I don't think I would use this airline again. I forgot to mention the lack of legroom for anyone taller than 4 feet.,Economy Class,1,2,2,1,3,no,123,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-10-20,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Recently flew return Vancouver to Guangzhou. The outgoing was a grey Skyteam plane and rather old with uncomfortable economy seat my cushion was slanted off towards left. The incoming was actual a CSA's 777 and over 2 hours late taking off resulting missing my connecting flight. The food were typical airlines varieties Most FAs had poor command of English and could not answer questions if CSA needs to be world class international they have a long way to go. However for the price of tickets I paid compensated for the poor seats and lack of IFE. Percentage of flying CSA again is 35%.,Economy Class,2,3,3,2,3,no,124,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-10-23,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,We flew Perth - Guangzhou - LAX October 2013. The check-in crew at Perth were superb helping us with our USA visas (which our travel agent hadn't done) and checking us through to LAX and informing us what we needed to do in Guangzhou. The flights themselves were as good as any we have flown with other more expensive airlines (all economy) the inflight entertainment was very good the seats and legroom all as good as other airlines. The lack of English speaking flight attendants was not a problem they all understood basic requests and certainly spoke English better than I spoke Chinese. All planes were modern and the long journeys were on the new A380's. On our return journey we had a 16 hour stopover in Guangzhou. We were offered a complementary hotel room and were taken on a bus to a hotel in the city. The hotel was ok but the beds were rock solid. Admittedly we all slept after the 14.5 hr flight. The hotel was a nice diversion and a way to see a bit of the real China outside of the airport. Our only minor disappointment was the food on board all the flights. It was very much traditional Chinese cuisine not the westernised version we eat in Australia but this is to be expected I suppose as it is a Chinese airline. All in all the experience was good and for the price we paid as a group of 5 adults the savings we made using China Southern were better spent as spending money on our trip than in the profits of a more expensive airline.,Economy Class,4,4,3,5,5,yes,125,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-10-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,AMS-CAN and CAN-CDG 20/24-Oct-2013. Both flights were on very recent A330-200 in economy. Seat was as good as an economy seat can be. The entertainment system was really good much better than the one found on many Western airlines. Big screen very good resolution a really large selection of movies in English and French many of them really new. Seat included a USB connection. Service was as expected neither bad nor good.

The CAN to LHR legs were in the new Boeing 787. Food was excellent only criticism being over small things - wines of very average quality no beer or spirits offered strange way or presenting coffee before breakfast and then none afterwards.

2013-10-29,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,New Delhi to Qiqihar (China) via Guangzhou. The service was horrible and staff appeared to be impatient and hostile at times. On the first leg of the journey the request for a coffee from a co-passenger was met with a cold stare from the air hostess. No inflight entertainment whatsoever! The food was just bearable. The second leg of the journey from Guangzhou to Qiqihar was unimaginable. Throughout the journey the flight attendants kept a stern face (no smile at all) and appeared to be either bored or uninterested in serving passengers. Blankets were provided only to a few (probably on first-come-first-serve basis). When the food was being served they gave me a chicken meal and I asked whether they could replace it with a vegetarian meal instead. The attendant said they could give me a veg meal and asked me to wait. Finally when all the passengers finished their meals the attendant brought me my veg meal and half-heartedly apologized for keeping me waiting since he was very busy! I had to return my meal uneaten.,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,no,129,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Lots of cabin crew milling around they then all disappeared for about 9 hours. Only saving grace was flatbed was fairly comfortable. It has to be said that the CZ lounge at Guangzhou is bad - either showers are working and there are no towels or there are towels but showers are not working!

2013-11-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,We travelled on an organized tour from Vancouver to Guangzhou and on to Saigon. The tour had an all inclusive price hence we don't know how much the actual airfare would have been. The incoming flight into Vancouver was 2 hours delayed which resulted in a 3 hours late departure to Guangzhou. We had a stopover of 5 hours in Guangzhou before our flight to Saigon. However with the 3 hour delayed departure ex Vancouver the stopover was cut to 2 hours. As it turned out it was a blessing in disguise since one cup of Coffee at the Guangzhou Airport was an astonishing US $13. As to our flight we can only say never ever again will we be flying China Southern. Asking for red wine with our meal we were given the equivalent of a thimble full when asking for a refill we were told that no more wine was available. The crew were outright rude. The food was edible but that's about it. As I said never ever again will we be traveling on China Southern.,Economy Class,3,1,3,N/A,N/A,no,132,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2013-11-08,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,China Southern Airlines are a joke! Left us waiting for 12 hours with no explanation at Paris CDG airport. When we asked what was happening at the departure lounge counter the excuses changed by the hour. First it was the fog then 5 hours later it was that the flight crew couldn't work past the original shift time then the plane had to be cleaned then hours and hours later when we were sitting on the plane ready for take off we were told we were waiting on documents. We got to CDG at 8am ready for our midday flight and didn't lift off till after 11pm. Not one announcement to us as to what was happening. We could have has a day in Paris instead of being held hostage in the most remote airport lounge starved of information. Meal voucher received one. The most appalling treatment at Guangzhou stop over - told we were on another delayed flight. Only because I made a fuss and refused to have my flight changed did we get on the connecting flight that had. Already been delayed not to mention the original connecting flight that as missed.

2013-11-11,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,Simply terrible from check-in at Melbourne airport through to Paris and return. The onboard crew displayed very little customer service and the food was terrible. It seemed to be quite a task to find two seats together for a couple who booked the flight together we did get adjoining seats but they did make it seem like a big deal. For the Guangzhou to Paris leg I contacted China Southern to try to ensure we could get seats together however even in their head office I wasn't able to speak to anyone in English - being an international airline I stupidly thought they may have someone around that could speak English. On the return leg from Paris they couldn't find our booking. They saw our tickets and verified that our tickets were showing the correct details of the flight however they could not find them. We made the flight with but some difficulty. On the return flight we took our own food to eat due to our previous experience.,Economy Class,2,1,1,2,2,no,138,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Staff shows unsealed kosher food to passenger prior to opening and cooking but served breakfast before dinner and the vegetables dish was still frozen. They still need to pay more attention to details. Other than that economy seats are quite reasonable.,Economy Class,4,4,4,3,4,yes,139,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-11-13,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,"Recently flew Beijing-Istanbul return specifying a direct flight on ticketing. Only staying 36 hours on return journey and told by Chinese Embassy Melbourne I didn't need a visa as Beijing is 72 hours visa free. Flight to Istanbul stopped in Urumqi becoming last port in China for passport control. Immediately set off alarm bells for return trip as Urumqi has only 24 hours visa free. Tried unsuccessfully to rectify situation in Amsterdam and Istanbul - total lack of customer service in both cities. Arrived in Urumqi and at Passport Control escorted to Immigration and for 4 hours passport and documentation handed from person to person. Eventually granted visa for extra 10 hours. Luggage had been removed from flight which had proceeded to Beijing. Eventually told no seats available to Beijing until 24 hours later and the airline would provide a hotel with meals. I would not consider being detained on a military base a hotel. Collected by a soldier in khaki in a utility vehicle and entered a guarded military base to a 'hotel' with no name. Soldiers on drill around me. No English spoken no wifi or Internet. Meal consisted of a bowl of soup whilst the Chinese ate 2 courses with seconds! Breakfast not much better. I would like to point out at this stage I had a valid visa for 34 hours in China. Next day at the airport soon discovered I wasn't booked on said flight - I was on standby. The 1.5 days I had planned in Beijing including accommodation costs were ruined resulting in a few hours between flights at the airport. At no stage was I apologised to by the airline for its misleading information or Immigration. I have contacted China Southern demanding they inform passengers flight is not direct and passport control is through Urumqi so this situation doesn't reoccur. After numerous emails each time from a different person (same as in Urumqi) this has been the response "" sorry for that"". Not good enough. Don't fly with this dreadful airline. Service on and off aircraft non-existent.",Economy Class,4,4,4,3,4,no,140,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-11-15,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,Nov 8 CZ3379 Changsha to Guangzhou. Nov 9 CZ3097 Guangzhou to Taipei. I had a lot of luggage it was consigned directly to Taipei. It's very convenient. The flight was a bit delayed but I was told in time so I was not too worried and had enough time shopping at the airport. All in all a happy and relaxing trip with China Southern. I will travel with CSA next time.,Economy Class,4,5,4,4,4,yes,141,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-11-18,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,Recently flew AMS-CAN and CAN-LHR in Economy. The flight on an A330 from AMS to CAN was reasonably comfortable but trying to get an allocated seat in advance was impossible. China Southern's office in Holland couldn't help either! The return to London on a new 787 was not as good. The seats were more cramped and I ended up sitting close to the toilets which have a new type of door design which means the doors actually slam shut! 12 hours of listening to all that noise was not enjoyable. The food was also poor and they ran out of choices and offered a vegetarian meal which was awful! Drinks were also a joke with no diet coke and only a poor selection of wine and only half a glass ever offered!,Economy Class,3,2,2,3,3,no,142,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-11-18,China Southern Airlines customer review,4,Flew Chengdu to Guangzhou on 16 Nov 2013 - no problem with flight and service but would not check my bag through to a connecting international flight with a China Southern flight number as it was a code share operated by Vietnam Airlines very inconvenient to have to pick up baggage and make way to international with bags when ultimately flying with same company. My connection time was OK (2hrs) but eaten into severely by bag taking a long time to reach reclaim - almost lost and then rushed to international where I was in time to check in but told to 'hurry up' by the check in staff - ridiculous as they were the ones that had caused the problem with the late bag and not checking through. Made the whole thing a hassle and made out to be my fault!,Economy Class,3,4,3,2,5,no,143,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-11-19,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,Traveled from London to Guangzhou CZ304 Sat 2nd November in Business Class. Been many times with China Southern and have to say both out and back the service was superb. Brand new Boeing Dreamliner was excellent and very comfortable indeed. I normally complain that the girls on China Southern are not very good but this time they were excellent. The food was not too bad although it is not their best point but they are trying. Just one complaint the films going out are the same coming back. This airline represents excellent value and because it is a direct flight to Guangzhou saves hours going via the Middle East. Definitely improving the service on board nice pleasant staff who couldn't do enough.,Business Class,5,5,3,3,5,yes,144,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

I was on a holiday to Australia and back on an economy saver ticket I bought online with China Sothern Airlines for the first time. There were 4 stops on this flight and the first bit was in the Dreamliner and what a fantastic aircraft. I never expected to get to fly in it so this was a brilliant experience. The staff were fantastic they were friendly and immaculately turned out professional and put the comfort and safety of passengers at the top of their list. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again. The airport at Guangzhou airport was bright and cheery and the shops were good. All in all a brilliant experience for me and my wife.,Economy Class,5,5,4,5,5,yes,145,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-11-20,China Southern Airlines customer review,,Smallest airline seats horrible food impossible to contact or get any satisfaction from. Flew to Vancouver from Sydney (29 hours). Had to upgrade on one flight as I simply could not fit my legs into the small space without jamming them into the seat in front. Dreading the return journey to Sydney and trying to get a seat with more leg room but most unsatisfactory.

I was excited as it was the newest plane around but it was so disappointing as the seat cushion was so hard. It was uncomfortable for a long flight. The plane transfer in Guangzhou was horrible.

Staff brought me to the first class lounge was provided with a good and tasty breakfast at 6.30 am. The flight was not delayed and the airlines provide a shuttle bus from the terminal to the plane. The service on board had a good English speaking flight attendant. The food was good for an early morning flight. I'm a Skyteam Elite Plus Card passenger and the service quality is always good.

2013-11-29,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,I flew from Vancouver to Kathmandu Nepal with a stopover in Guangzhou. I was as comfortable as you can be in an airplane the food was fine the staff friendly. In fact when the flight was about 2/3 done I went to use the bathroom and there was a staff member in there using rubber gloves to clean it. I have never seen that in flight and often by the end of the flight the bathrooms are disgusting! Flight was on time leaving and the stopover in Guangzhou was shorter than expected. I would use China Southern again.,Economy Class,4,5,4,4,5,yes,154,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-12-03,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Travelled from NRT to AKL via CAN. The flight from NRT to CAN was good. The staff were helpful food was quite good. However the flight from CAN to AKL was a disaster! I had thought the Boeing 787 would be a good one but it was absolutely not! The seat was uncomfortable even though I am an Asian guy! The food was bad and the stewardess who served could not speak English! The fellow passengers were noisy and messy but the crew did not ask them to be quiet even for a second! Toilets were not cleaned after being used by other passengers. The reason why I may recommend it to my friends is because it was the cheapest flight I could find!,Economy Class,3,3,2,3,4,yes,155,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-12-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,Flew SYD-CAN-SHA on CZ302 (A330 overnight flight) and CZ3523 (787 Dreamliner morning flight) 23-24 November 2013. The China Southern websites (they have multiple) are pretty hopeless I was not able to book through any of them when I bought my tickets in August so had to go through a travel agent. After getting my e-ticket issued at the start of November the websites did not allow me to check the flight details online. Some of the China Southern websites had nowhere to find the info at all while others simply rejected the various codes I had been given to enter. In terms of the flight itself: Left Sydney just a few minutes late and got to Guangzhou 25 minutes early. Flight from Guangzhou to Shanghai landed 30 min early. Seat comfort was quite good at least on par with most other airlines. Service was not the best I've experienced but staff are pleasant and generally friendly and the food was good by airline standards. Value for money is fairly good. The checked baggage allowance (2 x 23kg bags) is generous and applied all the way from SYD to SHA. Overall it's good value. There were no problems with the cabin crew's English on either leg except that one or two announcements were quite hard to understand. Finally transit at Guangzhou airport was quite efficient with lots of staff around to help out with directions. Due to early arrival there was a longer than expected flight and no shops were open until about 7am so you couldn't buy anything unless you had small change for the vending machines. Overall decent flights at a good price.,Economy Class,4,3,4,4,4,yes,156,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-12-05,China Southern Airlines customer review,,I'm a gold member for the China Southern Airline Sky Pearl Club and I always thought that it was one of the most highly rate airlines in China especially in the last couple of years. Unfortunately my recent experience on flight (CZ3460) from Yunnan to Shenzhen on November 30 2013 has completely changed my perception. There was a 6-hour flight delay due to undesirable weather conditions in Kunming Yunnan. The flight was able to take off later that afternoon but were astounded by the incident that happened after the flight landed at 7.05pm at the new Shenzhen Airport. As passengers were disembarking the plane to board an airport bus transfer back to the main terminal we were asked to board a bus that had no driver. Flight crews boarded their own coach and left all other passengers standing beside the plane for 20 minutes we were left waiting. We do understand that the new Shenzhen Airport only days after its official opening were not functioning in perfect order. Thus explained the missing driver? Furthermore its irresponsible for the China Southern crews to just leave all passengers unattended on the ground.,Economy Class,4,1,3,2,1,no,157,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2013-12-09,China Southern Airlines customer review,4,"Flew from Vancouver to Singapore with stopover in Guangzhou and return. I will never fly this airline again. Maybe it was a language barrier but I certainly felt my family and I as well as non-Chinese passengers did not received the same pleasant service as Chinese passengers. Food and drink service seemed very random and disorganized. They often skipped passengers when offering beverages and the flight attendants seemed to be bumping into one another while serving. Food wasn't the best but I can't complain as it's Economy airline food. Plane was old and outdated. TV screen was grainy and the complimentary headsets did not work. I wasn't aware that ""Airplane Mode"" on a cell phone was prohibited I complied however they should have enforced all other passengers with this rule as I had counted 5 other passengers breaking this rule in plain sight of the flight attendants. We only had an hour stopover in Guangzhou to reach our connecting flight however missed it as the flight was delayed and as we disembarked from the plane onto the tarmac and had to wait 10 minutes for a shuttle to take us to a different terminal. There wasn't any priority for those that were connecting The three things that were positive was that we arrived at out destination they did not lose our luggage and I was pleased with the airline with the Hotel arrangement during our missed flight in Guangzhou.",Economy Class,3,2,3,1,4,no,158,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

If I'd flown with Air New Zealand I would have paid over $10000. I don't need someone to wait on me hand and foot all I want is a comfortable seat.

They don't serve diet coke coke zero or mineral water. They left us on the tarmac for 2.5 hours without any explanation of the delay or what was happening.

When we boarded the plane we were given seats in the middle of the plane - rows 34 we were meant to be in row 31 as that's where families with babies go as you can put Bassinet onto wall there. Instead there were two men sitting in those seats I asked stewardess why we weren't in those seats and she said she would look into it.

2014-01-02,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,Flew LHR-CAN and CAN to HKT and back November 2013. Aircraft B787 and A321 economy. I am an experienced long haul traveller and bought this ticket because it was £200 cheaper than the average fare. After purchase I read the reviews on here and was regretting my decision. Well perhaps it's good to have low expectations because I was thrilled at the quality of the product for the price. In the past 2 years I have flown with Emirates Qatar and British airways to Thailand. The comfort of the seat and flight experience was as good as both BA and Qatar (I still prefer Emirates A380). The cabin crew were efficient and professional (maybe not as many smiles as some other airlines). The Inflight entertainment was perfectly OK (not quite as large a choice as others). The only thing that was not as good was the food however I found it edible and served in a timely manner. Would I recommend? Well I'm flying the same route again with them in 10 weeks so yes.,Economy Class,4,4,3,3,5,yes,166,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2014-01-02,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Heathrow to Perth 9 Dec returned 29 December via China. Heathrow to China leg was on the Dreamliner. The most uncomfortable trip we have had. Very hard and cramped seats. Trims falling off. Seemed like a mountaineering exercise to get out of the window seat and into the aisle. I still had aching legs two days later. However the flight from China to Perth was completely different and was a pleasure on a different aircraft. On all flights the food was good staff pleasant only the plane itself let them down. The airport was fine but food/drink very expensive and very difficult to get served. Take some instant coffee as hot water and cups are available and we were unable to get hold of a cup of coffee - gave up waiting for nearly an hour to be served. Will choose another airline next time purely because of our Dreamliner experience. This is a shame as we had a hotel in China due to a long layover which was well organised a good hotel with very reasonable restaurant.,Economy Class,1,4,4,3,3,no,168,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,We flew Premium Economy from Perth to Vancouver very good value compared to other airlines. Good to have a bit more legroom and separate more roomy cabin. Food OK. Our only complaint is the entertainment system on the Guangzhou to Vancouver route. The choice of channels is very limited couldn't really work out what was on and when and screen very small with too much reflection so just gave up and tried to sleep looked out the window walked up and down to the galley or spied on other travellers that had their own entertainment on their laptop/ipad.

2014-01-10,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,CDG (Air France) - CAN-BKK-CAN-LHR. By jointly selling their flights with Air France China Southern has fully demonstrated just how below average their service actually is. CZ seriously needs to reconsider their service on their shorter sectors (CAN-BKK-CAN). The language skill for their cabin staff on these sectors were laughable. Food is virtually inedible. Drinks served warm only red or white wine and on the return flight - a male flight attendant simply handed out meals without asking what the passenger would like (despite there being choices of chicken or fish). Transit in Guangzhou is efficient however the quality of ground staff seriously needs addressing. I had a slight issue with my booking when checking in at CDG and was strongly advised to check with customer service once landed in CAN. At the counter the staff simply wrote down the phone number of the call centre and was told to go away. The long flight (787) was comfortable and food marginally better than shorter flights. However still relatively poor in quality compared with other Asian or European airlines flying a comparable route. The command of English was also marginally better but still not great. No communication whatsoever from the flight crew for any of the flights despite delays stacking and turbulent flights.,Economy Class,4,2,2,4,3,no,172,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Onboard the touch function on the entertainment screen did not work so no music or TV. Airline staff customer care skills (major weak point). Cabin crew show a very low level of courtesy and customer care skills. New aircraft with third-world service. Female cabin crew rush past calling out arrival cards they don't look at passengers so I had to call her back. Some flight options are cheap if the low service is acceptable make your choice.

Out on an A330 late at night so a good sleep on a flat bed although my IFE was not working well and the FA's I think because they couldn't speak much English were not able to do much about it. CAN to LHR on 787. Great seats/beds. No noise cancelling headphones amenities to speak of and dumplings for breakfast! Asked for a drink but there is no menu. Explained Whisky and so when the FA turned up with a bottle to ask if this was Whisky I was pleased. Served in a Martini glass! Food was ok. Picked up 1 hr plus on the return trip but how would you know not one single announcement from the flight deck. Asked for Eggs for breakfast but whilst there was only 8 in our class they were sold out! Dumplings for breakfast. A380 CAN to Sydney. Lovely seats and setup.

2014-01-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Just returned from a trip Oz - Guangzhou plus an internal flight. The planes (A380 and A320) were very satisfactory being modern and adequately comfortable albeit with minimal seat and aisle sizes. Every flight seemed full. I would strongly recommend a home-packed picnic basket for self catering on board including a screw- top bottle of wine from the duty free shop airside. I considered the food served minimalist unpalatable and easily bypassed. The cabin attendants are well below international standard. Could even learn from Lufthansa and KLM! If CSA were the most convenient and best value option I would travel again with them but follow my own advice above.,Economy Class,4,1,1,2,3,no,179,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,19 Dec 2013 from LAX to MEL with layover in China. 28 hours of flying. 29 Dec 2013 Mel to Ho Chi Minh and back home on 11 Jan 2014. Flight was $500 cheaper than anyone else. CS got me there in a timely matter. I was relatively comfortable. had no problem eating the food I'm not very picky. My partner couldn't eat the cooked/main dish she just filled up on bread and fruits. On our flight they had some noodle bowls as snacks for people who couldn't eat the food. English is not their strong point but I just pointed at what I wanted and they helped me. Movies were good but I tried to sleep as much as possible. The point is if you don't have money and you are not picky go ahead and fly with CS if they are the cheapest. The flight is just a small part of your vacation you get more bang for your buck spending it on something else. If you want good food go to a nice restaurant. If you want to be pampered go to a spa.

Why oh why would they do this on planes used for 14hr flights. The food is by far the worst I have had. Very poor quality and selection and worst of all served cold which in my mind is dangerous. The staff however I thought were very pleasant and helpful.,Economy Class,1,4,1,4,3,no,181,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-15,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Perth-to LAX via Guangzhou was on time but the food was not good. They didn't have any ice or any diet fizzy drinks. LAX-to-Perth via Guangzhou with a 16 hour layover. LAX staff arranged a hotel for the 16 hour ahead of time and upon arrival we were handled very professionally and taken to a hotel about 30 min drive from the airport and picked up and taken back to the airport with no problems. The hotel was clean and had a great breakfast for us. It was half the price of Qantas so I'd do it again.,Economy Class,3,3,3,4,3,yes,182,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-17,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,MEL-CAN-MAD-CDG-CAN-MEL December 2013/January 2014. Decided to give it another go however no major changes. On the positive side departed and arrived on time entertainment system good and it was the cheapest fare available at the time. On the negative side no online check-in food very plain and with strange combinations drinks are always hot and have to request ice the English language is lacking. If it was not for the cheap fare we would not fly with them. We feel sorry for the passengers that pay for Air France service and instead get China Southern service due to the code sharing.,Economy Class,4,2,1,4,4,yes,183,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-17,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Flight from Heathrow to Guangzhou to Brisbane - very good easy transfer. Return flight spoilt by confusion with overnight accommodation in Guangzhou took 3.5 hrs between arrival and reaching hotel. Very poor information re. delay we just got moved about and nobody would answer our queries. Hotel was excellent. Only other comment is the difficulty of understanding in-flight information-needs more pre-recorded announcements to be sure everybody understands. Overall very good value for money.,Economy Class,4,4,3,4,5,yes,184,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-17,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,"The English version of their website is complicated. Somewhat a lottery. Then when it comes to a form where I have to specify whether to book as a member or non-member if I select ""non-member"" I will have to enter my mobile number. However it seems that the entry is programmed only for Chinese mobile numbers. I tried various formats all failed. The entries aren't flexible for international use. I couldn't get through just by filling in the form. Due to the locations in China I have been traveling to I have no other choice than CSA. During those bookings online payment failure has frequently occurred. I can try ten times in a row and fail ten times. Getting through until successful payment with CSA online in the English version is like winning a lottery. Although serving an international flight the crews on board barely speak a word of English. The English announcement heard through the loudspeaker on board requires high intelligence to understand. I saw fellow passengers playing with their mobile phones and crew saw them but said nothing. But when I did the same I was required to turn off mine. It wasn't during take off or landing. I tried to explain that I have set my mobile phone to ""Airplane Mode On"". However no matter how hard I tried to explain the stewardess didn't accept it. Would I recommend CSA? Yes but only if you don't have any other option for your destination.",Economy Class,4,2,3,2,3,yes,185,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-21,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,My husband and I flew from London to Ho Chi Minh City via Guangzhou and Hanoi to London via Guangzhou. Flight from London to Guangzhou was on the new Dreamliner which was very nice and inflight entertainment was good food was good and we slept most of the way as it was a night flight. Then had a 2 hour stopover in Guangzhou as it was New Years Eve decided to have a few beers in the airport this cost around £5 each but there was limited options to do anything else. Flight from Guangzhou to Ho Chi Minh City was ok food was not good and the drink selection poor. Our return flight from Hanoi to Guangzhou was nice it was a smallish plane with 2x2 seats on each side and the food was good. When we arrived in Guangzhou we had a 19 hour stopover and hoped to explore Guangzhou however the transit hotel we were given was a 40 minute drive from the airport. Dropped back at Baiyun airport 2.5 hours before our flight so were hanging around for a long time and the airport is very expensive. The flight back from Guangzhou to London left at 9.30am and I would say this was the worst of all the China Southern flights we had. An hour into the flight the stewards came round with drinks however the selection is limited my husband is a diabetic so cannot drink coca cola or other sugary fizzy drinks they had no diet drinks so the only options were tea or water. They did not have any alcoholic drinks. We were given a meal after the drinks were served and it was a choice of chicken or beef I had chicken with rice the chicken tasted awful. After the meal we were left to relax and watch movies there wasn't a great selection but enough to keep you going for 11 hours. The second meal was actually quite nice although I would have eaten anything at that point. I feel it is unacceptable to feed people twice on an 11.5 hour day flight on other airlines they usually provide a small sandwich or something in the middle and offer more drinks. Overall my experience just proves you get what you pay for and I have decided I am only flying direct from now onwards.,Economy Class,2,2,1,3,4,no,186,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-22,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,CGK-CAN-YVR-CAN-CGK Christmas 2013. Best price by far. If you don't care about inflight entertainment food drinks or service - but love saving that $1000+ then just be ready. My partner and I prepared our fully-loaded and powered-up tablets two foot long subs each plus copious snacks a bottle of wine and a six pack (all bought inside the secure zone). China Southern does provide you a hotel - we had two 23-hour layovers - but you are way out of the city. We splurged and spent one night at a hotel closer to the uber-urban city center and it was worth it. The plane was safe we were on schedule - efficient check-in. a sturdy airline I would fly again if time and comfort are again not the issue.,Economy Class,1,2,1,1,5,yes,187,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-25,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,LHR-CAN-MNL and return. I must admit that when I booked with China Southern I was a bit nervous about it as I had read several poor reviews but I needn't have worried as all the flights were fine. We were travelling with a 6 month old baby which proved to be no problem. There was no bassinets available on the LHR-CAN leg (which was fine as my daughter will not sleep in a bassinet at all) so they gave us a row to ourselves so we had plenty of room. They gave us a row to ourselves on all legs thereafter. Flights were on time. Dreamliner was all fresh and new. Food was as good if not better than other airlines I have flown with. All the staff were pleasant and very helpful - especially with the baby. The layover in Guangzhou was overnight on both outward and return and they provided hotels each time. Both hotels were of the highest quality. We managed to miss the bus to the hotel on the outward leg so they upgraded us to the Pullman Hotel at the airport which is only a few mins walk. We will definitely fly with them again.,Economy Class,3,5,4,5,3,yes,188,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-29,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,Moscow to Sanya and back. Flight to Sanya (with one change and stop) was ok though food and inflight service is quite poor. Return to Moscow was horrible. Flight from Sanya to Guangzhou was delayed 2 hrs so we missed our plane to Moscow from Guangzhou. Ground service of the airline was very bad. They were slow and spoke poor English. We spent almost 3 hrs after arrival to re-book our tickets collect luggage and wait for the hotel transfer. Flight CZ6001 was very difficult. After check-in the whole flight was taken for a security check 20 min before boarding: you go for the check wait get a card in addition to a boarding pass wait in another zone then go downstairs to a bus collect the card then almost 30 minutes on a bus to the plane. Stop in Urumqi for passport control you leave the plane wait in line for passport control go to wait for the boarding back then take off. They feed you just twice - once between CAN-URC and then once between URC-MOW.,Economy Class,2,1,1,1,3,no,189,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-01-31,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,On 3/12/13 we checked in at LHR for flight CZ304 and were kept waiting 1.5 hrs for someone to bring a wheelchair - it never arrived so my partner had to push me through to the aircraft. On arrival at Guangzhou the plane off loaded via steps to the tarmac. However as there was no lift available and only two small framed men who thought they were going carry me I had no choice but to negotiate the steps and I then I had to climb very steep steps onto the waiting bus. The return journey on 16/1/14 from Melbourne flight CZ322 to Guangzhou. This time the aircraft went to the terminal and a young lady waited for me with a wheelchair- only to push me around the corner to yet another flight of stairs! After much ado a young man came and pushed about 2 miles and then onto a bus to passport control this had taken approximately 1.5 hours.,Business Class,5,2,1,1,2,no,190,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

China Southern is the only airline with First Class on the 787 and it has a cabin with four excellent seats (the ones on the plane from London to Guangzhou were a different colour but otherwise the same as on the trip back). The service was outstanding - in both directions I was the only customer in First Class and I had 3 flight attendants assisting me. It was particularly easy to get on and off the plane - no hassles with secondary visa checks or other issues normal with trips to China.,First Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,194,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-02-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,SYD to LHR on 03/02/14. Excellent trip. Service was better than expected especially since reading many negative reviews of CSA. The A380 flight to Guangzhou was almost empty in business class which explains why CSA is taking this plane off the Sydney route I feel if they were to keep with it their patronage would certainly increase if my flight was anything to go by. The food service was as good as the other business class flights I take. Others complain about lack of English and flight deck announcements but I did not find either a problem. The A380 and the 787 make for a great combination for the Canton route and I appreciate the hotel offered for the layover.,Business Class,5,4,4,4,5,yes,195,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

The Dreamliner was used between London and Guangzhou (12.5 hours) and this flight was lovely. The food was delicious and the entertainment good. Seats were also very comfortable. London to Guangzhou was very enjoyable (this flight was the most important for me in terms of comfort due to the length). Between Guangzhou and Singapore (4 hours) this flight wasn't as nice.

2014-03-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Travelled London to Bangkok and back from Manila both via Guangzhou. Out of the 4 flights the staff on 3 of them were very poor and in cases extremely rude. On one flight a stewards jacket was over the back of my seat I took it off so not to lay back and crease it asked a member of staff to take it who with a slight grumble literally snatched it out of my hand. As I was sat at the very back of one flight on take off I turned round to notice one staff member slumped in her take off seat asleep. These new Dreamliners they use have terribly uncomfortable seats I didn't want to sit in them for 2 hours never mind 13hrs. I found I got a lot more space and nicer seating on the 2 short haul connection flights which used older aircraft.

We understand that they are entitled to breaks but they were hardly visible in the cabin other than to deliver meals.

Flights were on time I liked the food my luggage arrived the cost was better than the competition the plane was clean the staff helpful including office staff in Kathmandu where we had to change our flights. Can't really ask for more than that. The only possibly negative thing I could mention is the 8-hour layover in Guangzhou connecting from our flight from KTM to our flight to YVR.

When I arrived at Guangzhou an airline staff member met me and offered me hotel accommodation as I had a long wait over. I had not asked for this. He then guided me through customs. I have never had that level of service before on any airline! The seats on the 787 were very nice and the entertainment section was fine.

2014-03-30,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,Heathrow to Bangkok Thailand via Guangzhou China. I was pleasantly surprised about how great the flight was both ways. We flew a Boeing 787 economy seats. We were provided with a blanket soft pillow and headphones for the in- flight entertainment system and the seats were comfy. On the way out my boyfriend who is 6ft did not mind the amount of leg room (although we cheekily asked the China Southern check in rep to book us in the seats with more legroom just before the start of first class on the way back which was excellent as we could fully stretch out). We were fed twice on each 12 hour leg of the journey. We were also offered plenty of drinks and were given snacks by the cabin crew who were all Chinese polite and spoke good English. My only disappointment on the way out was that my entertainment screen was broken but instead of asking to be moved I just shared my boyfriend's screen as there were two headphone sockets. There was plenty of choice of new classic Asian etc movies music games and so on to keep us occupied. In comparison to other long haul flights I've taken the seat belt signs did go on quite a bit due to mild turbulence but I appreciate being safe than sorry! Lastly the toilets were fine and clean the connecting flights were fine (received another meal then) and the ground crew were helpful at Guangzhou.

Our seats 14 K and H were not reclining so we changed to 14 G and D which were reclining but a bit loose as they were happily swinging. Our TV screens were not working. Stop in Guangzhou wait in the lounge. Ok but if you are vegetarian no much to eat. We had a refreshing shower. Boarding next flight CZ305 to Auckland Business class. From the start a strong argument in Chinese with a lady economy class passenger. 4 economy passengers were seated in business class for take off after which two of them refused to move. Finally they were sent back to economy class. Curtains do not work. All the flight through economy class passengers were strolling through business class talking loudly. My seat 14A was not reclining so I had to move seat again. The food was good for my husband and for me (vegetarian option) friendly staff. But at one time our crew member apologised as she was called to help in economy class. Landing in Auckland. Already the huge wave of economy class passengers were rushing through the curtains and was contained by two ladies cabin crew. Luggage collection: We should have got our luggage in priority being business class passengers. Our luggage were the last ones to arrive. It was a very unpleasant experience with many passengers pushing through and piling their numerous pieces of luggage next to you. We have to travel back in two weeks time. Hope that the trip will be more pleasant and of a better quality. On the good side the planes are new and the pilots excellent.,Business Class,2,4,3,3,3,no,215,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-04-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,LHR-CAN-MEL/SYD-CAN-LHR (22 March - 6 April 2014). 787 aircraft seating was a little more cramped than the A330-300. The seat pocket is low and therefore equates to less leg room. The seat was also narrower than the A330. All aircraft were fitted with adequate entertainment systems (on demand movies your own screen etc). Staff were competent. English is not fluent for most but they are eager to assist and did understand all of our requests. In my experience this is consistent with airlines such as Qatar and Emirates. The food was regular and very tasty. All flights were on time or early. Guangzhou Airport is basic. You cannot buy your way into a lounge. There were 2 lounges for frequent flyers only. Overall my wife and I found the experience in Economy comparable with 5 star carriers who we have flown frequently in the past 4 years. We chose China Southern for our flights to Australia due to the price difference.

2014-04-13,China Southern Airlines customer review,4,"I was travelling from Amsterdam to Guangzhou on CZ308. The flight was smooth the entertainment unit was very good and always available and the food selection was reasonable. We were told because of severe storms at Guangzhou the plane would be diverted to Shenzhen and we would soon be given instructions. I thought this was a reasonable idea as quite possibly we would be able to catch a train to Guangzhou saving time or at least be let off the plane and have a stretch after such a long flight inside the airport terminal. Little did I know that we would have to wait an arduous 6.5 hours in the plane itself with barely any information relayed to us after about 1/2 an hour. This was most unsatisfactory and inconsiderate. What didn't help either was that the air stewards' English was as bad as my Chinese with any queries in English not understood replied to with a ""What?"".

2014-04-19,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,Flew Auckland to Guangzhou and return in the past week. The in-flight service was terrible on the way back to New Zealand and services were carried out without a single smile from any of the cabin crew. All the cabin crew had minimal English and were abrupt and inclined to give passengers any meal or drink irrespective of what was requested. They made assumptions that just because we spoke English we would therefore have an English meal. A smile would go a long way. Snacks were seen down in the kitchen area of the plane but we did not once have any of this offered. Hygiene standards questionable. When I went down to the back of the plane for a stretch and to ask for a glass of water I was ignored. Another hostess on her return trip back to that area answered my request once I caught her eye but all done without any eye contact or smile or any verbal exchange. Would not fly this airline again. For an international airline one would expect a better level of English language. At the end of the flight only one cabin crew in sight at the aircraft door and she was busy doing things so even if one wished to say thank you there was no one to say it to.,Economy Class,4,2,2,4,3,no,220,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2014-04-27,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,SYD-CAN-LAX return in First and Business. It was a fantastic trip with China Southern great value for money. SYD- CAN-SYD in Business and CAN-LAX-CAN in A380 first suite. All flights take off and landed on time Check in at SYD and LAX are fantastic. I accessed Qantas Business lounge in Sydney and Korea Air First lounge in LAX. I have to say QF business lounge is away better than KE first lounge in LAX. Staff on board are very friendly and professional in general AVOD program are improved from my previous trip with CSA. Food and drinks are pretty good. PJ was distributed for CAN-LAX-CAN legs pretty good quality PJs as well. First suite with A380 is fantastic very private staff did great trip on LAX-CAN leg toilet cleaned every time after passengers used bed was made every time I left. Transit in Guangzhou is also significantly improved you don't have to go through security or immigration for international transfer at CAN. Airline stamp on your boarding pass and you can go straight to lounge or boarding gate. The only down side is staff at CZ lounge in Guangzhou a lot of flights landing at same time around 5-6am but seem the lounge does not have enough staff they are not really helpful either. Considering how much I paid it was great value for money with CSA.,First Class,5,4,5,4,5,yes,222,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-05-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,I took flight CZ348 Paris-Guangzhou in April 2014. The aircraft itself was a little out dated but it was comfortable. There were not many passengers so we had more personal space making it a pleasant trip. Staff were helpful especially the attendant in my area yet other staff seemed distant despite being polite. The service on board was good but could be better considering the length of the trip especially in terms of the catering offer. The entertainment system on offer was satisfying.,Economy Class,3,4,3,5,3,yes,223,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-05-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,4,Outbound flight 0304 on 23/3/14 and return flight 0303 on 3/5/14. The flight was on time and was safely completed. That's the basics after all. Service was minimal and the cabin crew spent most of the flight chatting amongst themselves at the back of the plane. They came round twice each with drinks and food in the course of a thirteen hour flight. The food was right on the line as regards quality and quantity with very limited choice. The seat seemed to be the minimum size and was quite hard. The second-worst seat I have experienced as regards comfort. The charge for any excess baggage was £100 which I ended up paying on the return flight. Not impressed and will try to fly some other airline in future - maybe fly to Hong Kong and take a train into China.,Economy Class,1,1,1,3,3,no,224,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2014-05-06,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,We flew to Guangzhou from Sydney on 11/4/2014 on flight 302 in Economy and were very disappointed-no individual TV screens hence very poor inflight entertainment. Food and beverages very basic. However on our return to Sydney from Guangzhou we were booked into Premium Economy. Our flight from Siem Reap to Guangzhou was delayed for at least 6-8 hours hence the overnight accommodation we had booked in Guangzhou was minimised to 2 hours - time for a 1 hour sleep and a shower-quite disappointing. We then boarded our final flight to Sydney in premium Economy flight 301 and the flight was fantastic. We had inflight entertainment and food service was really good. Beverage service was quite basic as the 1 bottle of red wine was empty hence we could only have 1 glass of wine. Leg room was great in both Economy and Premium Economy.

It is impossible to redeem them on their website. Even when you ring China their points cannot be used on other Skyteam airlines so why Skyteam allow them as members is beyond me. Their new Dreamliner is very good in business class. I travel regularly and it is the only airline direct from Heathrow to Guangzhou.

The airline offers excellent value for money although the planes I flew on were a little old and tired looking and the electrics in the seats and headsets were faulty. The quality of the staff were outstanding (business class) and very well groomed. Seats were lay flat beds and very comfortable although a little extra leg room for those over 6' would be a bonus. Flights were on time and ground staff were friendly and helpful. The entertainment system was OK but a very annoying feature was the car ads which play at the beginning of every show and even if you change your mind and don't wish to watch a show that you have started watching you have to watch the ads again for a new selection. If I had one negative it would be the food which could only be rated 2 star and needs improving. Perhaps have a look at Cathy Pacific.,Business Class,4,5,2,2,5,yes,231,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-05-17,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,SYD to LHR. Two flights one on A330 and the other on B787. Extremely caring and courteous cabin crew although their English was hard to understand. Everything on time scrupulously clean toilets comfortable seats turning into flat beds 6 feet long. Aircraft in excellent condition. A330 SYD to CAN: Screens on the bulkheads are smaller than those on the seats and I found them hard to view. Availability of alcohol was minimal with no champagne 2 reds and 1 white only. The white was a Penfolds Koonunga Hill which I can buy at my supermarket for $7. I feel business class deserves better. I found the main meal of beef unappetizing with thick congealed gravy. Finally my sleep was curtailed as the FA's chatted happily in the galley just in front of my seat. The lounge at CAN was beautiful and transfer very easy. There were comfortable seats overlooking the airport and tasty food on the ground floor. Transfer to Boeing 787 by small VIP coach into excellent aircraft. Very impressed this was my first flight on a 787. Seat No 14 and this time Champagne offered before take off. Delicious but on asking for a refill it had run out! Later the Scotch had run dry as had the Heineken beer! And when it came to ordering the meal all the beef had run out too! However all food was good on this leg. Food service was a little erratic and my wife was a full course ahead of me. I would travel again with China Southern Airlines but would hope for better plentiful alcohol choice and a greater choice of movies and Western music.,Business Class,5,4,2,2,5,yes,232,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Drinks and some snacks (a plate of fruit which isn't fresh and some cookies) offered. Entertainment drop down TV but no headphones.

2014-05-25,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,PER-CAN-PEK return in May 2014. I booked a business class seat from Perth to Beijing return and my son in law flew premium economy. We booked because of the attractive prices. We flew two international sectors and two domestic. The aircraft are modern pilots are safety conscious. The staff on all sectors were polite and gracious. English was okay but a bit of a struggle if you are polite and patient you will be ok. Food is mostly Chinese but very good not the fried stuff but more cantonese style. Alcohol is available but not regularly offered except in business class. Seats in business class are similar to many airlines and premium economy extra legroom was very comfortable.,Business Class,5,4,3,2,5,yes,235,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-05-25,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,Sydney to Dublin (via Guanzghou and Heathrow). Check in at Sydney quick and efficient. They managed to sort out the luggage so it went directly to Dublin but this also meant that at no point was my luggage subject to Customers Inspection. Sydney Qantas lounge is below disappointing. Speedy priority boarding jackets collected and slippers provided. Boarding drinks offered. Food was good and there was loads of it. In Guangzhou escorted to the bus and through immigration quickly. The lounge in Guangzhou is very comfortable and good choices of food and drink. To London on the B787 same process once again. The cabin was split in two business class sections. The first one (which I was in) was for all passengers that stopped over in Guangzhou. Upon take off food was quickly served and our lights dimmed however the second cabin didn't have their lights dimmed. Questioned why this was the case and was advised how the cabin was split up and to ensure those traveling long haul were better rested. China Southern was fantastic. I was apprehensive at first but after my first experience I'm looking forward to the flight home. We paid $4900 return and well worth the money.

2014-06-08,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Recently I flew from Auckland to Guangzhou via one of their Boeing 787 aircraft. No problems with the seat booking arrangements and I paid a little extra ($25) to obtain an aisle seat on the sector. However it was the economy seat comfort or rather the lack of it which really down graded the service. 6000 miles on a hard seat is sort of bizarre torture by an airline there simply is not enough padding in the seat bottom to make the coach class travel seating bearable. Having said that the fare was reasonably priced and the staff service was good to a point. They ran out of meal options on the service. The final issue I experienced was trying to register for travel points before I left and after many attempts I just gave up.,Economy Class,2,3,3,3,5,no,240,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-06-08,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,Flown SZX-PEK (Shenzhen-Beijing) on an A380 business class on upper-deck last week (they call this first class in domestic and biz class on international flights). Check-in and security was fast. A long walk to the lounge and the gate at the new Shenzhen Airport. Lounge was mediocre. Priority boarding good. Now about the flight itself. Good things: seats very good comfortable and lie-flat a light quilt and soft pillows placed at every seat. IFE was very nice with headphones and lots of movies and other videos to watch but the ads are a bit annoying but can be fast-forward. Now the bad part. Staff didn't smile much makes you feel you're not welcomed. The A380 seemed under-staffed and I had to wait 10 minutes for a drink refill. Food seemed a little unfresh a mysterious sauce and meat? In general China Southern has 5-star hardware and 3-star staff and service in my opinion. I had used my FFP miles for this flight but if I had actually paid I might not be happy with the service quality.,Business Class,5,3,3,5,4,yes,241,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-06-09,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,My wife and I have just returned from six weeks in the UK flying China Southern from Sydney via Guangzhou London. The flight from Sydney to Guangzhou was perfect in economy flying an A330. Great seats good food AVOD fantastic and a wonderful crew. A flight in the brand new Boeing 787 what a let down I found the plane noisy cramped and the seating was shocking. They were hard small and only fit for small people. Get rid of those seats they are no good for a twelve hr flight. All was forgiven on our return flight from Guangzhou to Sydney in our beloved A330.,Economy Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,242,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Outbound flight was on 4/5/14 and due to take off at 22.35hrs. A plane fault delayed departure until midday the next day. Despite this problem I found the crew to be very friendly and they did their best to help me and my daughter. During the flight the crew made the journey a pleasant experience. I would have liked to have been made aware that there is no baby suitable food on board China Southern planes especially as the delay had caused me to use up some food that I had prepared for the journey. My return flight was on 28/5/14 CZ303. This journey was without issue and again I found the crew to be especially friendly and helpful. Overall I was very happy with the service China Southern provided and will definitely by flying with them again.,Economy Class,4,5,3,3,4,yes,243,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

The meals were what you would expect of any airline food I have in the last month travelled to London on a major European airline and except for the crew speaking English and the meals being western I could not see any major difference over all a very pleasant experience. If there was one complaint it would be the airport in Guangzhou very expensive to eat there.,Economy Class,5,5,4,4,5,yes,245,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-06-23,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Return trip to Singapore-Los Angeles via Guangzhou. I primarily chose this airline for the amazingly low prices they offered. I flew economy. I was wary but to my surprise I did have a pleasant flight. Its was very neat A380 Airbus and very clean toilets. The seats were comfortable and at my request they did manage to find the aisle seat. Good range of movies as part of inflight entertainment. Staff and crew were kind. No issues during onward journey. But only the return trip was in such a time that we were boarding past midnight and the staff just skimmed through the rows without really asking every passenger what drink they cared to have. If your a vegetarian or vegan the food could be a let down but I did manage to carry on my meals so no issues there. I will definitely choose to fly this airline again.,Economy Class,5,4,3,5,5,yes,246,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-06-25,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,On the +ve side: We obtained without difficulty transit visas temporary accommodation and ground transport in Guangzhou for our forced 17 hour stop over. Found all ground crew and flight crew to be courteous efficient and equal to any other well regarded international carriers that we have used. All flights were on time and the service equal to or better than most other airlines. Leg space (in Economy) was noticeably larger than any we have experienced domestically or internationally over the last 10 years. The cleanliness of the toilets and public areas of Guangzhou airport we found to be no different to Melbourne Fiumicino Rome or Paris CDG. On the -ve side: The numerous changes to our itinerary was in our view so unacceptably disruptive we consequently will never fly China Southern again. We made our original reservation August 2013 8 months before initial departure. Subjected to at least 3 minor changes to our itinerary and then cancellations of both our forward and return journeys. 3 months after our initial reservation our return journey was cancelled. 5 months after our initial reservation our forward journey was cancelled. The minor changes were not particularly significant and were related I believe to small adjustments for daylight saving between different time zones. However given that we had paid our full fare at the time of booking 8 months before departure the complete cancellations were intolerable. For our forward journey: Melb-Guangzhou-Paris in mid April our flight was changed from an am to a late pm departure. This meant a need (and cost to us) to cancel and rebook our flight from Tasmania and cancel our Melbourne accommodation. This forced change also included a 17 hours stop over in Guangzhou. Unfortunately despite being given by the airlines accommodation where we could lie down it just wasn't useful for catching up on sleep. Arrived in Paris one full day later than we originally planned. The cancellation of our return journey meant the change of departure to one day later than originally scheduled meant we were forced to stay one day more than originally planned.,Economy Class,5,5,5,5,3,no,247,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

This was our second return flight with China Southern as we had enjoyed our previous experience two years before and the price was again very competitive. This time we were in a 787 Dreamliner for three legs. This is a wonderful plane with better pressure and more fresh air. There were many large screens in the cabin showing where we were flying over (Russia and China on the second leg) where previously this was not shown. We had individual screens for our entertainment. Instead of just two adult films in English there were numerous recent box office films and TV shows. Gone were the strange Chinese isometric exercises before landing. The hostesses were professional and polite but still with little understanding of English or non Asian cuisine. Half the menu is European food. For our 18 hour wait on our return at Guangzhou airport we were again put in the Pullman just across the road from the airport at their expense. Altogether my husband and I had an excellent return trip.,Business Class,5,4,4,5,5,yes,252,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Flew from Sydney to Kathmandu with a stopover in Guangzhou then back from Kathmandu to Sydney again with a stopover in Guangzhou. Flight to Kathmandu was great. But the return flight was delayed then cancelled so I had to spend another night in Kathmandu and I had to share a hotel room with a stranger. Our next flight was then delayed as well. Then due to the cancellation I missed my connecting flight and so had to spend a night in Guangzhou. We arrived at the motel at midnight and had to leave at 5am the next morning. Then when I finally got my connecting flight they didn't have a vegetarian meal for me there either.

They could extend the range of wine available. This was not a problem as we seldom have wine on a flight. The rest rooms were clean and serviced throughout the flight. As we had a long stop over between connecting flights in Guangzhou we were put up in a 5 star Pullmans Hotel with breakfast provided. We were met by a young man who guided us through immigration etc and through the large airport to our hotel by the airport. He showed us where our departure lounge was for that evening.

2014-07-15,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,"Flew Sydney - Guangzhou - Bangkok - Guangzhou - Sydney in June-July 2014. The aircraft on Sydney - Guangzhou - Sydney was almost brand new with excellent in-flight entertainment. The food though was not just terrible it was offensive. On return leg to Sydney I ended up with munching on Cup-A-Noodle soup and chocolates purchased in BKK following my experience with in-flight meal on my leg to Guangzhou. There are no snacks on the plane. When asked for a snack the stewardess offered me a bread roll from someone else's meal. The staff are extremely rude and ineffective with very basic English skills. They gather at the galley to have a cosy chit-chat and if interrupted you are offered an ""evil look"" and then they pretend not to understand your request. The beverages? You are lucky if you get flat Coke and a quarter of a cup of wine which I believe is limited to a bottle per flight or so I was told by the crew. I certainly wouldn't rate this airline as ""fool service"" airline. It's a budget carrier with an urgent need for staff training. My trip CAN-BKK-CAN was even worse because the airplane looked and felt like a first generation of jets with the added ""benefits"" of meals literally offensive to both look and smell and served by rude staff. Of course a note on on-line check in. If someone has any success to solve this constantly crushing puzzle please provide instructions in your review for others to use. To be honest the tickets were very cheap though. Yet it's not the case of ""you get what you pay for"".",Economy Class,5,1,1,4,2,no,256,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

The entertainment programs were very poor the sound system sometimes didn't work. Meals were small and still awful. The crew were friendly enough but their English ability was pretty limited. I will avoid this so-called 4 star airlines in the future if I can.,Economy Class,2,2,1,2,4,no,260,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-07-22,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,Brisbane to Guangzhou Guangzhou to Amsterdam in April 2014 returning after 7 weeks away travelling Guangzhou back to Brisbane. My wife and I couldn't rate it higher. The plane seemed new seats good reservation of seats were made early and honoured when checking in. Staff were excellent. Meals were nice and plentiful. We did find the air-conditioning a little hot. This probably is hard to get right as some may prefer the warmth. The aircraft was full on all sectors and we were surprised by the lack of Australians travelling. English isn't the first language of the crew and for some crew it may not be one that they understand well. But that wasn't a barrier as our command of China's languages is zero. We had a smile when offered pasta for breakfast coming in to Brisbane. To our surprise it was a lovely warm omelette hash brown sausage etc. If this lack of English would offend some travellers then maybe they shouldn't travel at all. Our meals were lovely with fruit fresh. We enjoyed any little surprise because both we and the staff didn't always communicate well. The transit in Guangzhou of 7 hours was long on our trip to Amsterdam but this isn't a fault of the airline. Guangzhou Airport has a place where you can get free hot water. If you have tea bags or coffee you can fill up your thermos and have a hot drink as often as you want. It saves on high hot drink prices at the airport. We were surprised how popular this hot water dispenser was and so well used during our transit time. I hope your China Southern journey mirrors our experience.,Economy Class,5,5,5,3,5,yes,261,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-07-27,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,Mauritius-Shenzhen-Mauritius in business class. This is a new route and was my first time flying with a Chinese carrier. I consider this trip very good value. The aircraft was young and the product in business class is very nice. I slept well during the night. Tried Chinese food served on board they have a wonderful soup in canton style before the main course. Shenzhen airport also has a brand new terminal very large and modern with a lot of shops and restaurants. All staff at the check-in counter were attentive and helpful.

2014-07-31,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,CZ6347 23 May 2014. DLC-XIY was a rather good experience. Because the flight was short there was of course no in- flight entertainment system but as I checked in with a group they seemed to be rather efficient in getting everyone on their way. Communicating with the staff in English was also quite easy which I didn't expect so much on a domestic flight in China but was glad to not have that problem.,Economy Class,4,4,4,1,4,yes,263,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2014-08-13,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,"First Class on a 787 from Guangzhou to Vancouver. Airport check-in was good. The China Southern Lounge is far below the standard for 4 star airlines. It is very small and only has tables and chairs. There is food available including 2 freshly made hot dishes to order. The beverages are average. This is not to say that it is not comfortable and there is wif-fi. But compared to what I would consider 4-star ""standard"" such as ANA United etc. is does not come near that. There is only one row of First Class seating on the 787 and the seats were semi-pod. They did go fully flat and were comfortable for sleeping though if you are over 6 ft. tall you might find them a bit short. In the non-bed position they were comfortable though they do not really have foot rests - the leg rests stop mid-calf. There is a small shelf at the far end of the pod that does work so I would say the seating is quite adequate. VOD was in my opinion quite good with a large selection of Hollywood European Asian and Chinese films and lots of TV music and games options. The only negative is that the screen is fixed at the opposite end of the pod from the seat so it's a bit far away. The English proficiency of the cabin staff is not great so asking for anything that isn't in a narrow band of expectations can lead to confusion or your not getting what you wanted. This was as basic in my case as asking if they had any type of drinks beside red and white wine. Ends up they did but it took the purser to recognize my request. She then provided an extensive list of the drinks available on board which was very good. The food was good as well - no complaints. The staff was also quite attentive and ready to please. If you care about the sleeping suit I found it sized quite small. Overall a good experience which I would recommend and repeat if the routing called for it.",First Class,4,3,3,4,4,yes,266,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Lots of room good food with lots of fruit and great service from very attentive hostesses. I could not have been more happy with the service and the flight which was considerably cheaper than other airlines. The whole journey including the obvious experience of the pilots check in immigration and being able to have a shower in the Business lounge complex in transit was fantastic. I will definitely be booking my flights with China Southern in the future as it was a wonderful beginning and ending to my holiday.,Business Class,5,5,5,5,5,yes,267,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Initially the flight was delayed for an hour without any reason given. We boarded the plane and then disembarked back into the terminal 20 minutes later. Still no reason was given. So now all the passengers of flight CZ3547 China Southern Airlines are sitting in the terminal with no idea if this flight will ever leave.

The most disappointing and awful flights ever experienced in all my travelling years! Flew return from mid May - mid June 2014 from Auckland via Guangzhou to Amsterdam. Leg room was for midgets am only 5ft 7 and felt my knees were under my chin. The flight staff were very unfriendly always cross looking never saw a smile! Their English is almost non-existent. When kindly asked what the 2 food types were for dinner - the stewardess shoved a tray at me saying ""Western food"". The Canadian man next to me was equally appalled! Wine was not offered and when asked for a 'hint' was poured in a small glass. Sadly one would like to have it with a meal which only arrived half an hour later. The TV/Movies did not work on 2 of the 4 flights - 12hrs each! Guangzhou Airport is very disappointing old dilapidated with unfriendly staff everywhere. Shops seating dirty no wifi. Impression gained that furniture etc was obtained from other old airports that had been updated. Sadly this is a case of 'you get what you pay for'. I did my homework before I bought the ticket and read that China Southern wanted to break into the Western market. I felt confident that it would be good sadly it was terrible. Have since spoken with 3 other people whom will never fly with it again for the same reasons. It helps to pay extra and fly via decent airports. Interesting enough - Auckland Airport has Chinese instructions everywhere and on NZ flights etc. No English instructions on China Southern airlines or at Guangzhou airport. Only one positive - great price!",Economy Class,1,1,2,1,3,no,270,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-08-26,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,CZ347 Business class from Guangzhou to Paris. This recent flight is one of the most satisfactory international trips both in terms of the service and the facilities. I chose this flight because it was not that expensive. Plenty of choices of beverages and meals. The legroom is sufficient for a good rest which is important for a long journey. The only pity is that the entertainment didn't come up to expectations.

2014-09-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,CZ327 from Guangzhou to Los Angels economy class in last month. It was a satisfactory trip. The A380 is a pretty good plane with comfortable seats. One thing that impressed me was that when I got hungry during the flight I told one staff member that I wanted to buy some food. Even though she told me that there was no additional food for sale she gave me some cookies for free. Many latest Chinese movies can be found on the plane which made my long trip less boring. It disappointed me a bit as the food was not that good.,Economy Class,5,5,4,5,5,yes,272,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-09-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,"We flew the new JFK-CAN route then transferred to a Beijing flight. It was the worst airline I've experienced. Incompetent and unprofessional ground crew who have zero problem solving skills. Sour-faced service from the flight attendants their English skills were inexcusably bad. The food was awful it wasn't served frequently enough they were stingy with drinks. The transit experience in CAN (Baiyun) is long and uncomfortable. On the return trip it was late at night. We had to walk for 20 minutes. The ""free"" shuttle wasn't running. There was no one around to help. I strongly suggest that the elderly and disabled avoid this airline. Once you make it through all the immigration and security checks you are stuck in a tacky area with limited food and drinks and extortionate prices which are completely out of line with what other ""international"" transit terminals charge. The only positives: decent in-flight entertainment the plane was new; the landings for the international segments were very smooth.",Economy Class,2,1,1,4,2,no,273,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2014-09-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,I travelled with my quadriplegic nephew to Kunming China and our experience on the ground at the airports Kunming and Guangzhou were the worst in all of my travels. My nephew is just under 2 meters tall in Kunming the wheelchair China Southern provided to get my nephew from the check in desk to the aircraft was too small for him to fit in so he was allowed to use his chair to the door of the aircraft we had to carry him onboard and as he is so tall this was extremely difficult. When we got him onto the aircraft the airline staff said they could not check his wheelchair all the way to Sydney we would have to claim the chair in our transit airport Guangzhou and then re check it in to Sydney. After trying to argue the point for 1 hour and delaying the flight we had to agree as I feared they would not allow us to fly. In Guangzhou we had one of the staff help us again we had to carry my nephew off the aircraft put him into a wheelchair that he didn't fit in. The airport was so hot and we had to rush so much to find the chair at baggage collection go and check the chair in to Sydney and instead of the chair being taken by staff and put on the aircraft we had to wheel the chair with us all the way on to the aircraft and then the staff there put it into the luggage area. The flight was delayed because of us again. I would never travel with them again.,Business Class,3,1,2,2,2,no,275,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2014-09-17,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,I flew from Guangzhou to Sydney on 11th Sept 2014 (CZ301). I was very satisfied with the flight. The entertainment system was great: it had a huge variety of Hollywood films as well as Chinese and other foreign films. The TV series selection could have been wider. The service was friendly. The seats in Premium Economy were wide and there was plenty of leg room. I booked months in advance so the flight was cheap. The only thing I didn't like about my flight experience was the fact that all window shades and cabin lights were dimmed even though it was a daytime flight (8.20am departure time).,Premium Economy,4,4,3,4,5,yes,279,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-09-17,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,We flew Heathrow to Guangzhou with an 8 hours stopover and on to Auckland New Zealand. Check-in at Heathrow was confusing. After queuing for some time we were told Business and First class was around the corner in a separate part of the terminal. The VIP lounge was very good. At Guangzhou we were taken from the airbridge side to a small bus and several miles to Business lounge where we cooked at 27 degrees Celsius. Back on the aircraft it was a meal and off to sleep in our lie flat seats. Breakfast time and we were firstly offered butter and jam I am not sure why as no breads on the menu. we were in the last row of business so that is why we did not always get our first choice and had to settle for something else not necessarily to our liking. Breakfast arrived and was soup with noodles and meat. This might be alright for Chinese passengers but if flying Australasian routes why not cater to people from those countries? I think the airline could do better.,Business Class,4,4,3,3,4,yes,280,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2014-09-22,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,A really good effort from CZ on my first experiences. To tell the truth I was sceptical on how the long four sectors would go but overall they were great. Booked in business but upgraded to first I think due to my status on another alliance and possibly that I travel quite a bit. Flights were on time in fact boarded quite early in every instance which I like as I'd rather be in a peaceful plane that noisy busy terminal most often. Crew friendly and welcoming and while English is limited I had absolutely no problem getting what I wanted fast and efficiently on all sectors. Food was absolutely fine and up to a standard I was happy with both presentation and size and quality of range. They definitely know they must do this to reach the high yield European long haul market and they seem to do it well. Guangzhou premium lounge is only ok certainly not up to other airlines with limited range of food but there are good showers and wifi. Get a wifi code from the ground floor reception before you head to the top floor. CZ website and apps are rubbish so take care with these any use a travel agent unless you are Chinese and can make your way around the problems. Seating was good but not at the standard of Singapore or Etihad but not that far off. First class seat sent dead flat and they provide a nice bed cover and duvet. I don't sleep well on planes and I got several solid hours on multiple sectors on CZ both 787 and A330-200. Watch for cold red wine and warm every other wine and drink but if that the biggest complaint then it's not a major for the price.,First Class,4,4,4,4,5,yes,282,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-09-24,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,I booked with China Southern solely because of the unbeatable price - $1300 from Brisbane to Vancouver return. I flew from Brisbane to Guangzhou on one of CSAIR new airbuses which was relatively roomy with great inflight entertainment. The only downside of this flight was some very ordinary food. I'm not a fan of airplane food at the best of times but this food was close to unidentifiable. The next leg was from Guangzhou to Vancouver on one of the new Dreamliners which was great. CSAIR certainly have some of the most modern aircraft. The food on this leg was much better. The air stewards were good. Obviously English wasn't their first language but they did their best to understand English speaking customers. They don't bowl you over with friendliness but overall the trip was great especially when offered free accommodation due to a long stopover - only problem was I had already paid for accommodation. One thing if China really wants to crack the Western market they need to work on their 'people skills' at their airports. In Guangzhou we were made to feel very unwelcome with unhelpful airport staff. The 72hr transit visa waver is a bit of a nightmare with no one clearly explaining you need the boarding pass for your next leg even if it is 2 days away to get through customs - the airline ticket doesn't cut it. This meant being yelled at in Cantonese by customs officials - not exactly encouraging.,Economy Class,4,3,2,5,5,yes,283,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Auckland to Guangzhou Guangzhou to Amsterdam Paris to Guangzhou in business class very comfortable food average service good. Lounge in Guangzhou adequate only. Fourth leg Guangzhou to Auckland very disappointing. Departure gate very disorganized with other flights intermingled and no air bridge. On board in back section of business class we were not able to choose what we wanted from food menu for either meal. The inflight TV system was not working. During the night there was a constant number of economy passengers walking through the business class section during the night.

Cannot complain about the food as I do not eat airline food. In general this airline is not too bad. Flights are 80% on time. Very limited English skills both on the ground and in the air.

2014-10-22,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,I have to fly China Southern since several routes have CZ as the only operator. The last flight I took was on an E190 small jet. For a trip of less than 2 hours its not always good value for money. The flight was almost full in premium economy and economy class. There was no IFE/monitor in the aircraft even in the business class. The ground service and inflight service is poor. For a full service airline the meal is served by a paper box and contains one bread and a Chinese herbal pudding which I found very below par. I never heard any kind of communications or announcement to passengers from the cockpit on any flights even in Chinese language. After many flights with CZ only a few of the flight attendants that were really good and friendly.

The fourth leg (CAN-AKL) was dreadful - surly cabin crew no meal menus dreadful food (breakfast indelible - worse than EasyJet on a bad day) with a choice of butter or jam with soggy croissants. My insistence on both butter and jam was met with incredulity. A request by my wife for a second pillow was met with a flat refusal! In Business Class? So would we fly with them again?

Flight out of CAN was delayed 30 mins and they did not have my special meal which had been confirmed in LAX at the counter and was served on every other segment on my trip. This airline needs to do some deep cleaning! All of the cubby holes in their coveted highly advertised A380 are filthy with crumbs hair and toothpicks. I will look to other airlines next time. The B777 used on the CAN-TPE route is a pretty grubby plane. I can't believe they can't find someone to help them check the English used in their unintentionally hilarious IFE preview descriptions and the flight attendants clearly struggle with their English announcements.

Luckily the flight was not full and the middle seat next to me was vacant. The plane was an A380 so it was a ""new"" bird but to me the appearance was old and dirty. The lavatories were disgusting. This is just a small reflection of the terrible service. This is a 15 hour flight. There were only 2 meal services during this whole time. About 2 hours after take off and 2 hours before landing. Be prepared to go hungry. During the 11 hour interval between meals there was not a single time when the beverage cart appeared. I had to find a flight attendant and ask for a cup of water.

Food in economy class was acceptable. Inflight entertainment selection was low end and lacking in quality.,Economy Class,4,5,4,1,4,yes,299,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,A short flight from BKK to CAN on 19 November 2014. I am a tubby woman and so I dreaded the economy seat. To my To my surprise it was wide and had a good size pitch. Very comfortable and pleasant flight. Even the armrest was wide. Pleasant and efficient service thankfully without the constant forced grins that some airlines force their staff to exhibit. Though I normally fly business for comfort I will now happily fly shortish legs in economy with this airline.,Economy Class,5,5,4,4,5,yes,300,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,London (LHR) to Phuket (HKT) via Guangzhou (CAN). Cant fault it one bit. All flights on time. Excellent onboard service  good food continuous water runs hot towels before each meal. On the long sectors (LHR to CAN and return) the toilets were clean even after a 12 hour flight. For the product and value for money China Southern cannot be beaten. Only point of concern is Guangzhou airport. Although it has improved over the past few months a layover of any period over 3-4 hours can get very boring and the internal temperature is always kept high. Apart from that it is an excellent experience.,Economy Class,4,5,4,5,5,yes,301,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-18,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,NRT-CAN-SYD return. Generally I was disappointed with customer service on the ground at every turn. Inflight service however was generally rather good. I was told I had to phone China to get a seat assignment. What kind of airline has no phone number or no working website to take care of such basic matters? I did call China and they assigned a non-existent seat number! The seat I did get eventually on the flight from NRT to CAN did not work properly and I couldn't even use the tray table to eat my dinner. Due to an unannounced change in aircraft the plane arrived at CAN more than 90 minutes late and we missed our onward connection to Sydney. This can happen with any airline. The test of good service is what happens next. What happened next was a massive problem on the ground. The CZ staff seemed to be completely unprepared for and totally unequipped to deal with the problem of a planeload of people unable to travel onward. And yet if you read other reviews this is clearly something that happens frequently and something the staff should have a great deal of experience with. None of the promised services for business class passengers were provided - in either direction - during the Guangzhou stop-over. The ground staff seemed amazed and offended that I would expect them to provide the services promised in their own printed brochures. The flights themselves were generally good but the incredible hassles on the ground particularly at Guangzhou make this an airline best avoided.,Business Class,3,2,3,2,4,no,302,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-18,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,LHR-Auckland return via Guangzhou on B787. Not right not wrong just different. Very high quality of service by young enthusiastic attendants. Maybe their quality of English isn't great but I can't manage Cantonese. Food OK not great and the supply of alcohol is different to other airlines but if you ask you normally get the food or booze you want. Each leg had a slightly different approach to service but in each case service was excellent. When problems arose they were immediately addressed; when six cabin crew failed to fix the recline mechanism of my partner's seat she was immediately upgraded to first amid profuse apologies. Guangzhou Airport lounge does the job but a long layover isn't great and getting a shower early in the morning seems to need a lot of paperwork. Food could be a lot better. All in all great value for money.,Business Class,4,5,3,3,5,yes,303,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-18,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,I flew business class with China Southern from London Heathrow to Auckland New Zealand.

2014-12-22,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Few days ago from Shenyang to Pudong heavy snow in Shenyang but flight departed with a little delay due to de- icing of the machine. As usual no recognition of your Gold status with Skyteam no priority boarding no nothing. All in all you get used to it by now that these things just do not work with Chinese airlines. Cabin crew do not speak English announcements cannot be understood. The usual chicken rice no diet drinks but there was an English newspaper this time.,Economy Class,4,3,2,2,4,yes,305,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-29,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,NYC-CAN-KUL round-trip: Let me begin by saying their prices are very cheap so don't expect SIA First Class when you know you got a good deal so set your expectations right. NYC-CAN: New Boeing 777 smelling fresh with top notch media so many English and Asian movies/TV shows! I know people complain that the stewardess kept asking us to close the window blinds during the flight but I have a theory. They want the passengers to be calmer and give everyone the opportunity to sleep as much with all these different sleep cycles. I can actually say it was a wonderfully calm flight. The only downside is be prepared to be competitive with storage space. CAN-KUL: I can tell this is an old airplane so for the short flight I'll put up with the noise and hard seats. Overall great experience. Passengers off the flight in 10 minutes versus regular flights that take 15-20 minutes!,Economy Class,4,5,5,5,5,yes,306,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-29,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,We flew First Class AKL-CDG return firstly on the Dreamliner and then Airbus A330-200. Exceptional service from the moment we entered the plane. Food was perfectly adequate as was the class of champagne. The crew couldn't have done more for us. Entertainment was a bit of a let down not a great selection. We were 2 of only 3 people in first class so it was very conducive to sleeping. On arrival in Guangzhou we were met at the gate by a CZ employee who escorted us through Customs and then to The Pullman hotel for our 16 hour stopover. We were given a breakfast voucher for use during our stopover however having just had breakfast on the plane a lunch voucher would have been more beneficial. Hotel was lovely large room quiet and cool. Next leg to CDG Paris was just as good excellent service and only the 2 of us in First Class. Return journey back to AKL a month later was just as good. Southern China is excellent value for money and I'm not kidding myself that it is on a par with Emirates for instance but it allowed us to sleep well and arrive at our destinations in pretty good shape.,First Class,5,5,4,3,5,yes,307,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-31,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Flew AMS-CAN. The flight was okay. I can see why they do not have 5* and at the same time I'm surprised they have 4*. Being a very frequent traveller on Qatar Singapore Emirates I decided to give CS a go as their business class flights were very affordable. I think where they fail is what they offer to make your inflight experience more enjoyable. It's always the little things. Champagne offering cocktail offerings even food offerings! There were only 10 of us in the business class cabin and I was 3rd to place the food order yet they had already ran out choice. Their wine list is very short but was okay the teeny glasses they give aren't very nice though I think they are scared they will run out! The snacks on board was only a sandwich. Although the cabin crew gave great service their presence in the cabin wasn't that great there were quite a few stamping through the cabin to go to the galley past first class (or at least that's where I think they were going and not to sleep in the cabin! Entertainment on the flight was rubbish this is the biggest let down. The selection and choices of movies are very limited! Also they were very old. Like others I suggest you download stuff and watch it on your own iPad. I may fly China Southern again but to be honest for the price I paid I would fly Qatar business class.,Business Class,4,4,3,2,4,yes,308,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2014-12-31,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,21/05/2014 - MNL-NRT via Guangzhou. Initially I wasn't looking forward to having to wait for 13 hours in Guangzhou but to my surprise when I got off my plane and showed my ticket to a very nice flight attendant (who spoke excellent English) I was informed that I was to be put up in a hotel as my layover was more than 12 hours. Whilst the hotel was quite far away it was an excellent hotel! Both legs of the journey were short and so I didn't have enough time to receive a full experience of China southern. I'm aware that I was lucky to receive overnight accommodation but I would still fly China Southern again - for the price it's a fine airline.,Economy Class,3,4,3,3,5,yes,309,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-11,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,China Southern was an interesting experience. I flew with them from SYD-CAN CDG-CAN and CDG-SYD. I also had other Air France flights booked through them. Overall the experience was OK. Flight attendants did not speak English well and French was non-existent except the one French flight attendant from CDG-CAN. The food was not pleasant and I never got what I asked for they either ran out or confused chicken with fish. These are all petty problems but what makes me give them bad feedback was my journey from BCN to SYD (via CDG and CAN). They could only give me a boarding pass from BCN to CDG and told me they would give me a boarding pass at CDG. As someone who rarely flies internationally I was quite anxious especially when the flight was delayed an hour and a half cutting my stop over right down. At CDG I could not get a boarding pass but the Air France staff gave me this pass to get through the border police. I get to the gate and there is a mix of Air France and China Southern passengers lining up for the flight. Strangely all the people with Air France tickets had seats and all the China Southern people had the same ticketing issue as me. At the gate they only give me a ticket from CDG-CAN and I had to ask for CAN-SYD as well (as help at Guangzhou airport is non-existent). The whole experience was irritating and unprofessional. Why Air France customers had seats and their own passengers didn't was beyond me. Despite all this I would recommend them as they were a lot more comfortable than I expected and they were cheaper than all other airlines by a lot.,Economy Class,4,3,2,4,4,yes,310,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-11,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,Decided to fly business class due to affordable fare on offer with China Southern at 6ft 4 a flat bed for the duration of the trip from LHR to AKL return was too good an opportunity to miss. Having read a variety of reviews have to agree that service was inconsistent and as cabin half full on all but Guangzhou to LHR leg was surprised when given menu then advised that the choices were not available - on 2 legs (both ironically out of Guangzhou - the main hub of China Southern). Cabin crew were efficient and polite however once meal served after take-off disappeared until next meal 8 hours later without any offers of water besides a 200ml bottle distributed at 'lights out'. Transit service in both lounge and Pullman Hotel efficient and escorted through airport by member of staff was welcome despite needing to keep up with 'road runner'. Inflight entertainment choices were minimal but sufficient to while away the trip. In summary good value for money and would fly again if price is right!,Business Class,5,4,3,3,5,yes,311,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,4,MEL-CAN-LHR. Flight was delayed by a total of almost five hours due to a faulty emergency exit light - not what you need with an original departure time of 11.30pm. This information was only forthcoming when you actually asked the ground staff who seemed reluctant to publicise a technical fault. The airline asked for volunteers to fly a day later (with accommodation and meals provided) and boarding commenced very soon after they had found approximately 20. Apparently the light problem meant a reduced number of passengers could be carried. The volunteers were essentially tricked as at the time it was far from clear that boarding was imminent. We then sat on the plane for two hours whilst the volunteers' bags were unloaded and spent the flight to CAN wondering whether the LHR leg would be held for us. After landing we were quickly ushered through the CAN terminal handed a 100 Yuan note each as compensation for the delay and soon on board the Boeing 787 to LHR. The 787 passengers appeared to have been waiting on board for about two hours. Food beverages and seat comfort were reasonable and the aircraft near-new with slightly below-average IFE. The standard of staff English is much lower than comparable airlines but on the whole they do their best in terms of customer service. Overall not a terrible experience for the price (a quarter to a third lower than the competition) and we were probably unlucky with the technical fault.,Economy Class,4,3,3,2,4,yes,312,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,My 2pm flight with MU from Pudong to Shenyang was cancelled and changed to the 1pm CZ flight. Nothing major to complain about as I came in from Amsterdam with 50 kg of luggage CZ gladly accepted at check in (with my Gold card). Flight departed on time. Slept most of the time so cannot comment on food/drinks and cabin service.,Economy Class,5,4,3,2,5,yes,313,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-14,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,LAX to CAN on Dec 16th. Although our trip to Thailand was just a nightmare travel experience. Cancelled flights missed connections miscommunication nonsensical issues. We were not originally scheduled to fly on Southern China out of LAX. We were not even supposed to be in LAX when our trip first started. When all was said and done we were set up to go on China Southern out of LAX. Since I had never heard of this airline I was sceptical. I was very nervous to take a 15 hour flight to a communist country. I had already had a nightmarish travel experience leading up to this point. The last thing I needed was what I thought was going to be a dog eat dog experience. Well this experience was anything but that. We flew on the enormous A380. We had economy class and still got TV screen in front of us and they had the largest selection of movies to watch than any of the other airlines we flew. The flight attendants were great. I wish we had more water to drink on the flight though. The food was pretty good. The seats were wide and spacious. The 15 hour flight was one of the better ones. Landing in Guangzhou was also a great experience. The airport could have been kept a little warmer but we found a corner of the airport to watch the sun come up while we waited for our next flight to Bangkok. It was an easy 2.5 hour flight. When we got to Bangkok I noticed at baggage claim that my wallet was gone. I went into stress overload mode. Then we found out that the China Southern staff had found it on the plane and turned it into their office in the Bangkok airport. This all happened before I even knew the wallet was gone. I went and retrieved the wallet and found that it wasn't tampered with. It was even packaged up to make it so no one could tamper with it. China Southern Airlines saved my trip.,Economy Class,5,5,4,5,5,yes,314,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

All aircraft's except Guangzhou to Hanoi were modern. Inflight catering adequate. Cabin crew polite and helpfull. Overall great experience. No problems on transit at Guangzhou.

2015-01-19,China Southern Airlines customer review,4,I flew from Brisbane to Heathrow just before Christmas. I was not looking forward to this flight at all but it was the only one in my price range. In all honesty I can say I will never fly with them again. The 2 main reasons for this being 1) the food was horrendous and 2) the inflight entertainment was the worst on any airline I've flown it was difficult to use and the selection of movies was very small. The experience didn't get any better at the 7 hour stopover in Guangzhou. It has to be the most boring airport I've been to. You can't even connect to the wifi in there. Just fails all round. The only thing it has going for it is the price but for a long haul flight pay the extra and get the comfort you need.,Economy Class,3,3,1,1,3,no,316,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-19,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,After having read some reviews from the previous couple of years I was dreading flying at short notice from Auckland to Osaka via Guangzhou and return on 5 Jan 2015. However in all honesty the experience was as good as any I have had and I've flown around the world numerous times. The check in was smooth and friendly the aircraft (777-300er and a 787-8 Dreamliner) were clean and comfortable. There was good food and drinks when needed. The service was what to expect for an economy seat. I would definitely fly again with this airline for sure.,Economy Class,4,4,4,5,5,yes,317,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-19,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Flew Shenyang-Beijing return this week. Both segments very slightly delayed due to snow in Shenyang and the fog in Beijing. Airplanes clean staff ok and service during the 1 hour flight consisted of a pack of biscuits and a bottle of water coffee would have been nice though. For the first time flying with CZ I was given the credits for being a Gold member of the Skyteam group. Was welcomed by name priority checkin-security and baggage handling was excellent.,Economy Class,5,5,3,3,5,yes,318,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-19,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,I did a return trip from Sydney to London in China Southern business class in December 2014 and January 2015. It was the most comfortable trip I have ever had. The fully-reclinable seats were comfortable. The departure times from Sydney and London were conducive to sleep and the lounges were well-equipped. Transit times at Guangzhou were reasonably short. A few minor complaints like very poor choice of breakfast cereals on flight and it's best to bring your own in-flight entertainment.,Business Class,5,5,2,1,3,yes,319,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-21,China Southern Airlines customer review,1,CZ3878 on January 15 2015. Second flight was CZ399 on January 16 2015. I recently took two flights with China Southern. Both flights were delayed. The first flight was delayed for an hour with no reason given. The second flight CAN to JFK was delayed for two hours because a passengers claimed her baby had a fever and that a doctor should enter the plane and examine her baby before the flight could depart. The staff obviously had no training or idea as to what to do in this minor situation. We sat in the plane for two hours as various passengers quietly and politely tried to explain to the woman as to why she and her baby should just leave the plane if she did not want to travel. The woman had moved herself and her baby to the first class section while refusing to leave the plane. The woman eventually left the plane. Food was average or below the seat was ok but it is more than obvious that this airline is ill-equipped to deal with unusual situations no matter how minor. During the first meal service the flight attendant did not give me a choice. She just looked at me and then tossed a foil-wrapped hamburger at me. Nothing served with the hamburger just meat and bread in a foil wrapper. We arrived at JFK two hours late and of course there were no announcements or staff made available to those of us who were late to our connecting flights.,Economy Class,3,1,2,2,3,no,320,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Seats were very comfortable full recline so sleeping was good. Flight crew were very attentive good service and good selection of food. In the past reviews have complained of lack of English by the crew we did not find this to be a problem. Highly recommended and great value for fare paid.

Polite cabin crew meals ok and large enough. Frequent drinking water distribution throughout the flights which as a non-sleeper I always appreciate. The entertainment system is below average and Guangzhou Airport is not a fun place to while away the hours but on the whole an acceptable experience when the price is right and everything goes to plan.,Economy Class,3,3,3,2,4,yes,323,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-30,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,I've taken 4 flights with China Southern in the past month and it's been awful. The price is good but only if you want to pay for it with your sanity. Every single flight was late to arrive and the routes seemed to be set up in a hurry. I was flying from Moscow to Sydney which is supposed to be a 1 stop trip on Guangzhou. What they don't tell you is they cram you on a tiny plane and send you off to Urumqi or Wuhan first. You actually have to enter China. (that's a whole other story). The Service on board is satisfactory the food is below average compared to other airlines. I got sick off one of the meals I had on board. By the last flight with them I was bringing my own water and food on board. I really wouldn't be recommending them pay the extra few hundred dollars and getting a more decent airline is recommended.,Economy Class,2,2,1,1,3,no,324,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-01-30,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,I flew from Manilla to Amsterdam on 28 January 2015 until the 29th. The flight from Beijing to Amsterdam was good. Nothing bad nothing good. The toilets were clean I liked that. Also the hotel between the flight was really nice. But the crew from the first flight (Manilla to Beijing CZ378) were not very nice. A question was almost too much to answer and if you got an answer they were really short. The crew spoke horrible English. I couldn't understand a word they said. I don't think this is a good service and hopefully China Southern can do something about this.,Economy Class,3,1,3,2,3,yes,325,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-02-06,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,"I flew Brisbane to Guangzhou in February 2014. The plane was the Boeing Dreamliner. The seating configuration was extremely cramped and I'm only 5ft 4 so don't know how the taller people can even fit in the seats. Not only that there wasn't really any padding in the seats so it was an extremely uncomfortable long flight. The food was good typical western food that was loaded onto the plane by a catering company in Brisbane airport. The flight was smooth and so was the landing. Guangzhou airport is an experience unto itself its an incredibly unfriendly had no idea where to go or what to do the staff just shout in Chinese so its not tourist friendly in the slightest. I can confirm that as my connecting flight wasn't till the next day they drove us in a minibus to a 5 star hotel. I suggest dining in the ""western restaurant"" at the hotel as I didn't and I ended up with the strangest dining experience. I would recommend flying with this airline but I may not do it again.",Economy Class,1,4,4,4,4,yes,326,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-02-11,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,For the price you pay for China Southern it is really difficult to complain about them. We travelled on a dreamliner so it was clean comfortable and featured a decent multimedia system. Food was pretty poor even by plane food standards and they ran out of Western breakfasts so we were presented with something that was totally inedible. The staff did serve us first for lunch though to ensure we had a choice. Drink runs weren't overly frequent however you just go and find the staff when you want a drink and it is not a problem. The worst experience for us was Guangzhou airport. All the staff we encountered in the shops / cafes were incredibly rude and miserable and everything is shockingly overpriced. However none of this is the airlines fault. All in all I would fly China Southern again if need be if the price was so much cheaper like this time. They are no Emirates however they don't price themselves to be. All in all a competent airline that I am not too sure why there are so many people giving negative reviews too. Don't pay for a Fiat and expect a Ferrari.,Economy Class,4,3,3,3,5,yes,327,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

I want to highlight CZ335 on 20th January 2015 from Guangzhou to Auckland. Excellent service provided by cabin crews impressed me a lot. I was sitting in the last row (53C) which is next to the kitchen. I could see the crews and purser carefully preparing food and beverages.

Meal itself on AMS-PEK was made in UK but not completely defrosted yet and not that tasty. CAN-AMS was made in China and much better. All came in a plastic box inside plastic foil with seal and cardboard. Downsides: Black coffee had to be prepared on request no diet/zero Coke or even soda. Great service by all of the flight attendants! Although not all speak perfect English they try very much to help. I even could get a few leftover meals (garbage anyway) for my layovers. Seats were quite nice as well headrest moveable up and down and sides could be set up to keep the head from flapping to the sides.,Economy Class,5,5,4,5,4,yes,336,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-03-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,3,PEK-XMN-MNL CZ377 A321. After boarding we were grounded what turned out to be 2hrs. FAs were starting to serve meals on the ground and even collect them. I knew I'd be very late (1am due to delay) in MNL but it was impossible to get transferred to another flight. FAs seemed very unhappy that I complained at all. I ordered Hindu meal. PEK- XMN: chicken in tomato sauce with rice and fresh beans with coconut flakes. XMN-MNL: Fish in mostly soy sauce rice pak choi or morning glory. Each time accompanied by roll salad and dessert - tasty. Downsides again: Black coffee had to be prepared on request no diet/zero Coke or even soda. Seats not as good a A332 but okay. Entertainment only general TV sets without sound.,Economy Class,3,2,3,1,3,no,337,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2015-03-09,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Another pleasant flight with China Southern third round trip in a year from LAX to CAN. Ground staff were friendly and helpful during delay. Business lounge was crowded no quiet moments at all. Brand new Airbus 380 seats and lavatories were clean good selection of movies and drinks. Food was just OK. It was a night trip from CAN to LAX so I enjoyed a sound sleep on lie flat seats. Cabin staff were attentive but had to be really patient with them because most of them spoke poor English and I didn't quite understand what they said most of the time. Good experience from a competitive expense definitely my first choice on this route.,Business Class,5,4,3,5,5,yes,339,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2015-03-23,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,Recently flew rt LAX-CAN-BKK on China Southern. The flights between LAX and CAN on new A380's were fantastic! The planes were very clean particularly the lavatories throughout both flights. The cabin attendants were attentive and there was never any communication problems with the cabin personnel. Food and beverage service was fast and excellent (in economy). The meals were surprisingly good. The price was a bargain. The Guangzhou airport was modern and clean. The transfer connections were easy and nearby. You don't have to go through security for a second time and you don't have to dash to another faraway terminal. The 737 flights between CAN and BKK were so so. You're packed in in 3 across tight seating. It's a quick 2.5 hr flight with beverage and meal service which didn't match the standards of the A380 flights. All in all I highly recommend CSA for a trans- Pacific flight to Asia!,Economy Class,5,5,5,4,5,yes,344,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2015-03-23,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Auckland-Guangzhou-New Delhi return in economy. The positives: The Auckland-Guangzhou part of journey in the air was good. Food beverage and inflight entertainment was acceptable for the price you pay. The airplane is modern and the seats have a little leg rest in economy. The Negatives: 1. On my AKL-CAN-DEL journey my flight to Delhi was cancelled due to bad weather. From here the airline ground staff could have been courteous and helped us through the process of passing immigration and customs so we can take bus to hotel. But no they weren't. They treated us with disdain and were very rude. A guy with very little English told us to follow him as we navigated the airport from gate to bus via customs and immigration. The food they served was awful. The airline kept all passengers uninformed as to when the next flight was. Once I got to the airport the airline gave us boarding passes for 7am flight. Once I arrived at gate I was told that it was actually for the 11am flight. During the 5 hour wait we were lucky to get water and food from the airline. Flight delays occurs for many reasons its how the staff handle them from then on that makes the difference. 2. The planes from Canton - Delhi - Canton were old and had no inflight entertainment. In summary I would not fly with them again.,Economy Class,4,2,3,3,2,no,346,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2015-03-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,LHR-MEL Business class. I was a little nervous that the cost of this flight would be a reflection of the service that you get onboard. I have to say that it was excellent the food was great the staff friendly and the best thing is you get a lie flat bed even though on the A330 to Melbourne it says its a flat pitched seat. Well its only off fully flat by about 5 degrees so you would never notice. I am quite a big fella and at 6'2 I found the seats perfect much better than the cam shell arrangement I have had on Virgin. The only slight issue with China Southern is the entertainment its just a bit limited for westerners but my flight cost me about £2300 compared to Qantas / Emirates £5000 so buy yourself a top spec laptop with what you have saved and take that onboard!,Business Class,5,5,5,2,5,yes,348,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-03-28,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,26th May CZ336 then CZ303. 7th July CZ304 then CZ335. China Southern was chosen for a good price in Business Class and the Dreamliner. We flew Auckland to China then on to the UK. We retraced our home flight to New Zealand so it was 4 legs taken. When we first boarded in Auckland no drinks allowed until in the air. (My wife requested vegetarian food on all legs of flight when booking the tickets). When the hostess asked for our meal choice during the flight my wife had no choices for her this happened several times on the 4 legs. Ok in the air now they ran out of beer and champagne after 1 hr explanation was only one bottle for business class so wife asked for a whisky and dry out comes a beer glass full of whisky and a small bottle of ginger ale. This happened on most of the flights and the movies forget it. Would we use them again never.,Business Class,4,4,1,1,3,no,349,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2015-04-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,"Having flown LHR-CAN and CAN-HKT return recently I really can't understand how people can grumble for the price paid. Online check in was non-existent due to website issues so did the old fashioned thing and checked in at the airport. Boarded first due to travelling with children. I am 6' 5"" so if I were sat with 3 adults it would have been a challenge. As we were travelling with a child I could get my legs into quite a nice position and slept for about 7 hours. Good selection of films for a 12 hour flight. Kids TV options aren't great so a portable DVD might be a better option. Service onboard was great. A drinks run before food a food run and then another drinks run - twice. Food was generally edible. Service is quick and effective and staff can speak enough English to get by. Dreamliner certainly kept me feeling fresh once we had arrived into CAN. CAN to HKT on a A321 was a little different in that there was no entertainment but a full food and drinks service. Return flights were exactly the same so for the money we paid I can't fault China Southern. The transfer was easy at Guangzhou as you are bussed to the international terminal go up the stairs and the transfer desk are immediately there. Guangzhou airport doesn't offer much to do so again bring entertainment if you have a transfer.",Economy Class,4,5,4,4,4,yes,351,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

We flew LAX-CAN-BKK and back. Flight was delayed 3 hrs in LAX. Luckily we had 3 days of transit in CAN or we would've most likely missed our connecting flight. Other reviews had stated poor customer service. I didn't get that at all. Everyone greeted us with smiles and offered assistance. Western food offered was terrible though. Chinese options were more edible. This was also our first time in A380. Wow what an experience. Much better than the old 747s I've been on growing up. I'd take this airline again.,Economy Class,5,5,4,5,5,yes,354,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2015-04-20,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,I spotted an excellent deal for a Business Class return London Heathrow to Auckland at 2500 GBP so I decided to pay family in NZ a quick visit. The legs between London and Guangzhou were served by 787 and the Guangzhou Auckland legs by 777-300ER. The 787 has lie flat seats in pairs perfectly comfortable for sleeping but there did seem to be some issues with the operation of some seats and cabin crew seemed quite familiar with dismantling and fiddling with the mechanisms. Possibly not the sturdiest of kit. The 777 seats were of more substantial build with singles at the windows and pairs in the middle. The Sky Team lounge in Heathrow was lovely the China Southern lounge in Guangzhou was what one expects in China shiny of the surface but a bit rickety underneath only two showers and some confusion as to the booking procedure little food cheap wine etc.. However it did the job OK. Cabin crew were lovely if not occasionally disorganised I had requested vegetarian meals which only appeared on 3 of the 4 sectors and on those that it did appear bits of it seemed to be offered to other passengers in error leaving me with one meal consisting only of a main course. Not great but If you're familiar with China then you'll cope fine with it all. Would I fly with them again? Yes if the price differential is large enough but if they try to charge the same as the other major players on the route then probably not.,Business Class,4,3,3,3,5,yes,358,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,I took a chance with CSA on a flight from LHR-GHZ-LHR. The 787 outward flight was fine no problems. the return flight was not so good. The inflight entertainment system had major problems and the flight crew announced that there was a problem with the system and it needed to be reset after 15 mins still not working. For about 8 hours of a 12 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment system. I am so glad I had my laptop at hand. The cabin crew were very nice. I will not fly with CSA again though. I will use KLM again.,Economy Class,1,4,1,1,4,no,359,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-02,China Southern Airlines customer review,4,We flew standard class from Heathrow to Guangzhou then a change and on to Bangkok. The flights were cheap £400 each. The staff were very friendly and polite food was fine - you have the choice of English or Chinese. I would advise anyone to take their own water supply on though as they were a bit mean with the drinks. However the seats are so small and squashed together. Very much like Ryanair style. Which is fine for a short flight but certainly not to Bangkok! It was very uncomfortable and I am only 5ft 2 inch tall and a small frame so goodness only knows how anyone larger than myself coped with it. Actually I did not cope. I took a valium because it was just too claustrophobic. I would advise anyone reading this to think very carefully before booking a long haul flight with this company. Either go business class - if you can afford it or book with someone else!,Economy Class,1,4,4,3,2,no,360,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-06,China Southern Airlines customer review,10,May 1 from Shanghai to Shenyang. Flight on-time. Clean airplane FA ok but no English. Cannot comment on the food as I did not eat but slept all the time. Upon arrival in Shenyang was welcomed by ground-staff being a Gold member and transported to the terminal in VIP bus. Nice but would have appreciated Gold status recognition in the aircraft. Priority bag handling was ok this time.,Economy Class,5,4,3,3,4,yes,361,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-06,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Flew LAX-Guangzhou-Xian-Guangzhou-Manila-Guangzhou-LAX over a 12 day period in April. I decided to book with them because of the price they were offering. Coach seats are narrow and rows are close even on transpacific. It is very similar to flying coach on domestic US flights. That is don't be expecting much in the way of comfort. In- flight entertainment on the transpacific leg is OK and about the same as Air China and China Air. Surprisingly the in-flight meals were somewhat tastier on CZ compared to the other airlines and the level of service was certainly acceptable. If you are connecting international to domestic (or vice versa) and sticking with CZ for the onward leg the transfer is surprisingly smooth. Layovers at Baiyun/Guangzhou airport are not as bad as you'll read in the reviews of that facility. But if you are landing there from overseas it might be a good idea to have changed a little money into yuan before leaving home. One of the areas in which CZ is certainly lacking is in its online capabilities. I decided to book directly through the airlines website in order to save a few $. Without getting into the details it was a bit of a pain. Before initial departure CZ changed the arrival time of one of my flight legs. This caused me to miss a scheduled connection. Getting the connecting flight adjusted to accommodate their schedule change could not be handled online or through e-mails. Only a call (ended up being several) to their offices in China could affect a change. I am a flyer that has an overriding need for an aisle seat on long flights. Even with what I thought were confirmed aisle seat reservations for all flights I failed to notice that on the final Guangzhou - LAX leg they gave me a boarding pass for a window seat. Fortunately I was able to cut a deal with another passenger who was willing to swap aisle for window. TIP: if it is important to you to use your own noise cancelling headphones in-flight on CZ you will need a one pin F to two pin M adapter. Bottom line: if there is a price advantage to taking CZ go ahead and book this perfectly adequate carrier.,Economy Class,2,3,5,4,5,yes,362,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-08,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,I took CZ307 on the 4th. Due to the thunderstorm in Guangzhou our flight was delayed. The announcements were made in time and the flight attendant served us drinks. About 1.5 hrs later we took off. The meal was served soon after we were airborne the choice were limited and by the time they get to my row I didn't even have an option. However the flight attendant promised to let me choose first for the second meal. I wouldn't say the food was delicious but it's okay for what I paid for the ticket. Seat was okay but my touch screen didn't work so I had to use the control button which makes no sense at all it took me while to work that out. Toilets were cleaned promptly. I would say it was a good flight but mostly for the service. The meal could improved a bit and entertainment could be better. Would recommend it.,Economy Class,4,5,3,3,5,yes,363,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-08,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,May 3rd 2015 - flight CZ386 and CZ321. Have never flown Business Class before but the cost of the flight from Tokyo to Melbourne (via Guanghzou) convinced us to try China Southern. We certainly have no complaints with good service all the way through with English speaking staff available. The food was good and whilst the inflight entertainment was limited there was certainly enough to keep us entertained. No reason that we won't fly China Southern again.,Business Class,4,4,4,3,4,yes,364,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-10,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,I flew business class on CZ 327 from Guangzhou to Los Angeles this week and the value (ticket price) for the flight comfort was very good. The newer A380 is specked out with fully lie flat bed/seats and comfortable. China Southern are proficient in getting you from a to b but they still have some catching up to do with the inflight service.

2015-05-12,China Southern Airlines customer review,9,19/4/15 Flight 304. 1/5/15 Flight 303. 30/4/15 Flight 3050. Travelled from London to Vietnam via Guangzhou and back. Very impressed with the quality of service. The staff both at check in and onboard were very helpful and went out of their way to assist us. As my husband is very tall they gave us seats with extra leg room and even changed our seats during a stop over to ensure that the long journey was comfortable for my husband. Also the staff onboard were very accommodating when it was discovered that our tour company had not ordered me a vegetarian meal as requested. The air hostess very kindly let me have vegetarian crew meals and were most accommodating giving me a choice of meal each time. This went over and above the call of duty. We stayed in a China Southern hotel during our 18 hour stopover and were very impressed with the quality of the hotel. However we found it quite confusing to find where we got transport to the hotel and staff at this desk were not the most helpful. Their level of English was not great. Apart from that I found China Southern Airways to be highly efficient and would definitely travel with them again.,Economy Class,4,5,4,4,4,yes,366,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-16,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,I regularly travel China Southern business class from Heathrow to Guangzhou and also internal flights in China. I am one of their Pearl Club Members (Sky Team). Their web site is rubbish and you cannot use all the points. I am an Elite Member but you cannot use the points for any flights and you cannot do it online. You have to ring China and that takes forever because no one answers the phone even then they will not book the flight for you.

2015-05-25,China Southern Airlines customer review,6,Just last week I flew from London into Guangzhou with China Southern as opposed to my favorite carrier Qatar. We booked CS this time as it was a direct flight which knocked some four hours off our usual journey time. Having flown with Chinese airlines before and having said I would not use them for long-haul flights again I was a little hesitant. However I was reasonably surprised. I am not saying they were as good as Qatar they certainly were not but they were not too bad either. The biggest problem was the seating very narrow and not that well padded at the back so you could feel the rigid parts of the seat on your back. I am not a large guy about 172cm tall and weighing about 80kg but I imagine for anyone much larger it would be pretty uncomfortable. The entertainment was somewhat limited there were only two programs in the TV section which is pretty abysmal by anyone's standards. The movie section offered a much better choice although I had already watched most of them but CS cannot be blamed for that. Food was ok not up to the best of the carriers but certainly an improvement over the last time I took along haul CS flight about eight years ago. We had wine with the meal that was not at all bad it was French not Chinese and they did drinks runs a few times throughout the flight. Cabin crew were good very pleasant and helpful. All in all not the best but to be fair they have improved over the last few years and for a direct flight the cost was pretty good. In the past they were never that competitive on price but they seem to be overcoming that know. If they could just sort out the poor seating and tweak the entertainment and food they would be very good.,Economy Class,2,4,4,3,4,yes,368,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-05-31,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Last week I flew economy class on CZ 304/303 Boeing 787 from London to Guangzhou and back. The onboard staff were very helpful. It was very hot in Guangzhou so my jumper was left inside my luggage. I was in a rush to pack up and catch the flight back to London and forgot to take my jumper out. It turned out that onboard it was quite cold. I covered myself with the provided blanket but still felt cold. The flight attendant noticed and asked whether I needed extra blankets and some hot water or wine to warm up. After having two more blankets and drinking two big cups of hot water I felt much better. All in all I highly recommend China Southern for a direct flight to Guangzhou! The food and drinks were surprisingly good (in economy). The planes and toilet were very clean. The cabin attendants were friendly and helpful. The services and the value (ticket price) for the direct flight was very good.,Economy Class,4,5,5,4,4,yes,369,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-06-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,Flew CZ3538 from Shanghai to Guangzhou on 1st March 2015. Overall a very pleasant flight. The lie flat beds on the A330 was comfortable enough for some power nap on such 2.5hrs flight. Cabin crew were attentive and polite. Price paid was good value for money for first class. Ground check-in and priority baggage handling were also swift so all in all would recommend flying again on this route with CS.,First Class,4,4,4,3,5,yes,370,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China
2015-06-01,China Southern Airlines customer review,7,London Heathrow CZ 304 15th May 2015. Return CZ 303 from Guangzhou 26th May 2015 Business Class. I have to say that the air hostesses were helpful and couldn't do enough. The food was good and to be honest they have turned this side of their business around. It used to be pretty rubbish but I have to say I was impressed. The business class seats in the Dreamliner are comfortable and there is a lot of space. Not quite as good as the Middle East airlines but the are improving and of course at an excellent price. I have a problem with the Sky team points which no other airline accepts but the flight is direct takes about 10 hours and that is much better than going via the middle east or paying lots of money to go via Hong Kong by British Carriers.,Business Class,5,5,3,4,5,yes,371,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

CZ303 30th May Guangzhou to London. On the whole we were impressed and would fly China Southern again. Obviously they are very competitive on price and we felt that over the four flights they represented good value for money. The seats were reasonably comfortable - not perfect but economy seats never are with any airline - and the legroom was pretty good. We asked for vegetarian meals and the quality of the meals was high. The in-flight entertainment was limited and needs to be widened but the headphones were at least given out free unlike some airlines.

2015-06-04,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,I regularly travel with CS to South China usually with domestic connecting flights too. The value for money is good and domestic flights hardly get cancelled however the delay which is very good if you really need to be there for important meetings. I flew CZ328 from Los Angeles to Guangzhou on 17th May. Flight on time and A380 seats were comfortable. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight. Food choices again limited. Inflight entertainment system broke down a couple of times and had to be rebooted. Business class cabin crew were polite and well spoken with eyes for details.

2015-06-06,China Southern Airlines customer review,2,I flew from Melbourne to Xiamen but flight CZ 3741 was delayed 6 hours after waiting 6 hours before for connection. We were give little information and the waiting lounge was standing room only. Now flying back to Guangzhou on CZ 3880 it's that same story. We got in two hours late and I missed my CZ 321 flight to Melbourne. I was put up in a hotel about an hour's drive from the airport. Back the next day for the same flight but this was delayed then cancelled. The staff were unable to cope with the customer requests for hotel accommodation. I was sent back to the G19 desk three times where the young inexperienced staff who didn't speak English were totally overwhelmed. Eventually at 1:30am we were led to a bus outside but it was a mini-van that only took half of us. The rest were told there would be another bus in an hours time. I gave up then and ended up sleeping at the airport which was very uncomfortable. I have learned that there are many storms around southern China in May/June so it's understandable that there are disruptions which are difficult to predict. But China Southern should be better prepared for this and able to communicate well to passengers. The staff are quite dedicated but they lack adequate management structures to provide supervision on these occasions. The result is chaos.,Economy Class,4,3,5,N/A,N/A,no,374,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2015-06-07,China Southern Airlines customer review,5,Our son and daughter in law flew with them from New Zealand to visit us in UK and wanted to take an additional bag back to New Zealand and asked us to find out the cost. In February I phoned China Southern at Heathrow and carefully checked the cost and was given a break down of charge depending on whether booked at airport or on line and made it VERY clear the flight was London to Auckland. The day before they were due to fly I again phoned to check the figures and got the same charge to book in additional case at the airport. On arrival they were told the fee was double as it was two flights and would not budge. She felt she was being treated very badly and the attitude of the staff was absolutely dreadful. They were not that impressed with the flight to the UK and said food was nothing special and somewhat greasy and the staff not that bothered. They were not particularly looking forward to the return flight. Overall outcome is they will not use China Southern again nor would we try them when we next visit New Zealand.,Economy Class,3,2,2,2,3,no,377,,,,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

2015-06-12,China Southern Airlines customer review,8,"Recently took CZ from SYD-CAN-JFK and return in Business. The Australian legs utilise A330-200 aircraft with 2-2-2 seating. Flights to and from USA much better with 777-300ER, with a 1-2-1 configuration. Overall excellent value for money. Skyteam lounge in Sydney quite new and comfortable, although lounges in CAN and JFK have seen better days. Rather surprised to be conveyed to 777 by bus, I can only assume that as the aircraft were only acquired last year, steps are being taken to remedy this. Once on board, welcome glasses of champagne. Inflight dining a bit hit or miss, but I'm not a fan of Cantonese food so can't moan about that. Wine is pretty much ""red or white"", but the cabin crew are always attentive, with cabin walk-through so being common. IFE very limited, but with personal devices, it's pretty much a dying issue. I habitually use Asian airlines for trips to the UK and USA. Usually Vietnam, China Eastern and China Southern. Clearly not as good as the big three Arabian carriers, nor the legacy BA or QF. However, when it comes to value for money, there is no comparison. Would recommend CZ.",Business Class,4,4,3,2,5,yes,379,A330-200 and 777-300ER,Business,SYD-CAN-JFK,,,,China Southern Airlines,China

Boarded a fairly new B737 - clean and tidy and in Business Class all seats had power. Offered a bar service as well as fresh fruit on the short sector to Zhengzhou and the aircraft stops here before carrying on to Shanghai. Transit process well organised and offered lounge usage - again, Chinese standard and WiFi (which is all I really needed) did not work. Staff were proactive and did try to resolve but not much else they could do. Full meal service on the second sector to SHA - proper menus and 3 entrée choices, whilst all Chinese were fairly agreeable to a western palate. Food quality was good and regular beverage services. Staff were proactive during both flights and language skills were decent for a domestic service.

ALL other legs were from 45 min to 4 hours late. Airline cannot keep schedule because of clogged airways due to military controlling 80% of airspace.

More interested in playing on their phones! Plane was delayed in Hongqiao for 4 hours. Staff did not know what was happening and had no idea when the plane would fly. When the plane did take off, they did not have my special meal, so I had very little to eat. Got to Guangzhou and only had 45 minutes to catch next flight.

On the flight they also did not have my special meal available. I had booked and confirmed this 1 month in advance for all legs of my journey. So I had to pick what little I could eat and since I had missed my special meal on 2 flights I was pretty hungry and slept most of the time. Staff did not make any special effort to get me anything extra. On arrival into Auckland we found our luggage was left behind in Guangzhou.

The entertainment (personal) was quite limited for English but still had a variety of TV sit-coms/dramas and movies. Coming back a bonus was that even for domestic-international if you have more than 6 hours wait (we had 12 hours) they put you up in a hotel room for free including transfers even during the day. You go to international check in, find G17 which is opposite the G's for check in and they check your details and then escort you onto a bus for your transit hotel. Bonus. However the seats we had 51A, 51C coming back from Guangzhou to Melbourne, mine didn't recline and my husband had NO tray table. It was removed some time some how. We mentioned this to the flight attendant who said they would be willing to let him sit somewhere else to eat. Me, well too bad. Not the greatest help. So instead of the hassle he just balanced his meal on his lap. Not really acceptable. Shame as we would have rated this airline much higher if they had done the right thing by us and let us sit in seats that had all their bits working, like a table and a recline (it was an overnight flight).

On a ""second perusal"" of our booking the lady at the Business Class Check-In ""found"" the request and asked us to walk to the ""Assistance Area"" - the other end of Terminal 4.

I pointed out that people are using laptop. She said laptop is ok but not the cell phone. I started using the laptop but of course the battery ran out quickly. Food was not good. After arriving Guangzhou, I was up for a surprise. I was supposed to transfer to the San Francisco flight, instead they asked me to go thru immigration and customs.  I asked why, and the answer is you have to take a domestic flight to go to another city then catch the SFO flight from there!  I did all that. Then after an hour I passed thru the immigration and security for the domestic terminal.  I went outside the terminal and came back 1.5 hours later again going thru immigration/security. After landing at the domestic terminal, I had to go thru immigration/customs and immigration/security for the international. Altogether I had to go thru 4 immigration and 6 customs/security.

The meals served out of London are fabulous, and the best across the China Southern route network - had a dinner after take-off and breakfast before arrival into Guangzhou. IFE is okay, not the best, but much improved on earlier years and quite a few Hollywood / western movies to watch. Flight arrived early, and luckily I had priority lane through immigration as Guangzhou airport was busy and chaos at main immigration counters.

The food definitely had an Asian bias, but that was both interesting and tasty and they fed us until we had to refuse. The films and music were more than adequate with plenty of choice. Seats were very good and gave us a good nights sleep (for an airline bed).  I can't compliment this airline enough (never heard of it until now) but they tried very hard to please and they did. Someone told me that they were a 4-Star airline, and they equalled BA club class any day of the week. Would I fly with them again - definitely yes. The only downside was the connection in Guangzhou (a very boring airport) - the food in the China Southern VIP lounge was poor and uninteresting, but that was fine as the aircraft had over fed us.

Safety systems and checks were something of a joke, but I guess related to the fact many customers think this is a train and they can get up and walk about at will and any time.

The trip to Thailand was uneventful. The return is where all of the problems began. We were scheduled for a flight on November 16th that was supposed to go from Bangkok to Wuhan, China with a 14 hour layover and then continue on to San Francisco. The airline cancelled the Bangkok to Wuhan flight and didn't notify anyone of the cancellation. They simply rebooked us to a flight on the following day. No communication and no explanation. We had to pay for a hotel in Bangkok. No offer to assist by the airline. The flight from Bangkok to Wuhan (that they rescheduled us on) was scheduled to arrive hours after the connection to San Francisco departed. We pointed this out to the airline. This would constitute a two night stay in Wuhan as this airline only has one flight to San Francisco a day. The airline offered to put us up in their very own hotel - but only for 1 night and we had to pay the second night! We verbally and by email requested an upgrade as a compensation for the problems. These extremely rude and idiotic ""professionals"" just smiled, giggled and continually said ""so sorry"". No upgrade, no partial reimbursement, nothing!

Cabin crew well trained and very attentive, although their English tended to be a bit lacking at times. No problem with the flights. The only negative in the whole experience was Guangzhou Airport. The aircraft didn't pull up to the terminal building so you have to disembark on the tarmac and meet a bus to the terminal, which seemed miles away. Same with getting on the plane from the terminal. Also, we had a 7.5 hour wait at Guangzhou in both directions. Whilst the business lounge is comfortable, the food is primarily Chinese with very little western meals available.

2015-11-23,"""suite very private and quiet""",8,"The check-in procedure was straightforward and we were given lounge access in Auckland (the Emperor lounge is used by several airlines and pay guests and it is barely adequate). Boarding was quick and easy, and our allocated seats were prepared with newspaper, menus and amenity kits. As it was a late evening departure, we had a quick dinner before the beds were readied for the night. Sleeper suits were provided. The suite on the Boeing 777 is very private and quiet. There were 2 toilets for three first class passengers! We had breakfast before landing on time in Guangzhou. We had a four hour transit time which we needed, as the international long haul flights we took all required bus transfers from the plane to the terminal and reverse. The China Southern lounge covers two floors - the lower part is the catering area and offers hot and cold foods as well as hot/cold beverages and limited alcoholic drinks. The upper level is much more comfortable, but the only access is via stairs (with well worn carpet!). The second leg of the journey to London Heathrow was on a Boeing 787. We were the only first class passengers so had a dedicated service. The first class seats are more open than on the 777, and not as comfortable. There is no storage for personal effects other than in a pull-out bin under the footrest. This was a day flight but we still needed sleep - the windows do not have pull down shutters, and despite the crews best efforts, the sun still shone in - they ended up putting a blanket over the windows! The meals were suitable for the journey, but note that they only had one main course dish at each meal, so we each had to choose a different dish. No sleeper suits were offered on this leg. We arrived pretty much on time, which was good as several flights had been cancelled that morning due to fog. As my partner required a wheelchair, there was a wait whilst all other passengers disembarked: there was a long queue at immigration, however we were cleared quickly through the special arrivals line.

2015-11-23,"""only letdown is Guangzhou Airport""",9,"Sydney to Beijing via Guangzhou return. The A380 on Sydney to Guangzhou return legs was excellent. There was lots of legroom, and a large, clear touchscreen for IFE. The range of non-Chinese films and TV was bigger than I expected, so there was plenty to keep me entertained. The choice of non-Chinese music was surprisingly broad, and while there were some very surprising choices, there was enough there to keep even a music snob like me happy. Food was okay, but nothing special. China Southern, like all Chinese airlines, needs to learn that beer is a lot nicer when it's cold, but otherwise everything was good. The Guangzhou to Beijing flights were in an A330. There wasn't quite as much space as in the A380, but it was OK. On the way back, the IFE system was even better than in the A380, but on the way up, IFE for three or four rows of seats (including mine) wasn't working. We were given tablets as replacements, which was fine. Service was excellent on all four legs: staff were friendly and helpful. I lucked out and got three seats to myself on the overnight CAN-SYD flight, and slept well. Unlike every other airline I've flown on overnight to Sydney, the FAs decided not to pointlessly wake me four hours before landing in order to serve me a breakfast I didn't want. Instead, they saved a breakfast for me, and asked me if I wanted it when they saw me get up. This was brilliant. The only letdown is Guangzhou Airport. You have to enter and leave China at Guangzhou if you're transferring between domestic and international flights. Passport checking is horribly understaffed, as is security. It took me more than 90 minutes of my two-hour transfer time to get through passport and security on the way to Beijing, and only slightly less on the way back. The whole process is chaotic : after passport control on the way into China, you have to queue to get a golf cart to domestic departures, where you're left with no signage or directions at all.

Also, the flight times were more attractive than flying from Perth through Sydney or Brisbane. We took advantage of the free night in Guangzhou because of a longer than 8 hour transit time on the way out. This was all handled very efficiently after a pretty good flight. The business class seats on the Boeing 787 were comfortable and food and wine acceptable. Not up to same standards of Qatar or Singapore Airlines but had paid much less for the tickets! Cheap headphones but okay inflight entertainment. We were met at Guangzhou airport (names on a board) and escorted through immigration to the Pullman Hotel, which offered a very comfortable room, good breakfast the next day. We paid for our dinner. We checked our bags direct from Perth to Vancouver and had a change of clothes etc in hand luggage. So it was easy checking in at the transit lounge for the onward flight to Vancouver - also a Boeing 787, but we were not offered pyjamas for 12 hour overnight flight. Food and wine acceptable. Flight from LA on the A380 we found the flight attendants in need of training. We had to ask them to hang our coats - only apple or orange juice offered prior to takeoff, the food/beverage choices limited. The seats were configured 1x2x1 and we opted for a two in the middle. The design meant that there was a very small space through which to leave our seats.  The seats seemed narrower and very hard. We were given a very thin undercover as well as a duvet when settling to sleep but it made little difference. The armrests covered in very hard plastic - I used an extra pillow as it was so uncomfortable - digging into my arm when eating, reading etc. Good noise-cancelling headphones. Entertainment and amenities ok. Food was mediocre as were the wines. No other drinks offered after dinner. The toilet was not kept replenished, I had to ask them to clean and renew towels / toilet paper. A selection of snacks put out but was not replenished once many of the offerings had been consumed. Guangzhou to Perth overnight, again on a Boeing 787. We headed for the business class Lounge to have dinner so we could sleep as long as possible. Terrible lounge offered 1 white and 2 red wines, beers and soft drinks, but not much Western food and most seats taken. WiFi was slow. Food served downstairs. Sitting area upstairs. Didn't take dinner on the plane but ordered breakfast which was inedible eggs Benedictine, brought before the fruit, had to ask for coffee.

On my return flight from Amsterdam to Auckland I could get only the first boarding pass from Amsterdam to Guangzhou and was told, the second boarding pass would be waiting for me in Guangzhou. That boarding pass was handed to me by the staff at the airport in Guangzhou. However, the seat was number 44D, a seat in economy class, while I had booked and paid for Premium Economy. I questioned the allocation and the stewardess referred me to the head stewardess who referred me to staff outside the plane. Unfortunately the command of English language of staff was very limited, so he was either unable or unwilling to give an explanation why I was not offered the seat I had paid for. The plane had a premium economy section. All he was explaining was, that it is not his fault and I need to complain to the ticket issuer in Amsterdam. I wasn't concerned whose fault it was. I only wanted my premium economy seat with more leg room - I am 66 years old and have severe leg problems in the small economy class seats. The unpleasant conversation ended in an ultimatum by the staff to me, either to leave the aircraft or to accept that seat on offer. I accepted the seat under protest.  What makes the whole issue particular galling is the fact, that I changed my initial booking with China Southern Airlines. I had overlooked that the flight via Beijing was economy only for the last flight, Beijing to Auckland. Given my leg problems I paid the penalty for changing the flight to Guangzhou to ensure I would fly all the way premium economy only to end up in a situation I desperately tried to avoid.  I had requested Asian Vegetarian meals for my flights, but was offered a vegetarian meal only on the first flight. The other three flights I was offered meat dishes and only after pointing out the fact, I had booked Asian Vegetarian, I was offered an alternative, usually ""vegan ""which I don't like but had to accept in the circumstances. There were problems with the onboard entertainment systems. Only on the first flight everything worked. On the three remaining flights I wasn't able to operate the touch screens and on the advice of the stewardesses I used the controls in the armrest. However, even with the assistance of the stewardesses I was not able to watch any movie. All in all, a very disappointing first experience with this airline.

When I entered the aircraft, staff escorted me to my seat, and took my jacket. Another crew member asked me what I wanted to drink, the only choice offered was water or juice. After all passengers boarded, there was an announcement that upgrades were available. There was about 10 passengers in the business cabin. I did not see any passenger upgrade. Shortly after the aircraft took off, a male cabin crew was pulling down the shutters, he stopped and ordered me to produce my boarding pass. At first I wasn't sure I heard him right. I asked him what he said, and he repeated the order. I got up and out of my seat to retrieve it from my carryon bag in the overhead compartment. As I was doing so, I saw him talking to another crew member. Apparently, she told him that I was a business class passenger because he walked back to me and told me not to bother. I was the only one in the entire business class cabin he asked to show a boarding pass. I was professionally dressed. In fact, I can comfortably say I dressed better than the rest of the passengers in that cabin, most of whom were in casual clothes. The only conclusion I could come up with is I am an African-American, and the experience left me quite disappointed. I fly several times a year, to various parts of the world in business class, some of which were domestic flights in places like Vietnam. Not once did such a thing happen to me on those flights. I complained to China Southern Airlines and so far no response. Food and wine offered on all four legs of my flight were basic. Service was good, except that on the longhaul segments, cabin crew members disappeared after meals were served. I liked the fact that China Southern Airlines staff meet business class passengers upon arrival at Guangzhou airport, with a board with each passenger's name written on it, and they escort the passengers through immigration to their connection flights.

The flat seats were very comfortable, service on board by well trained and courteous cabin crew was faultless and the assistance received by the ground staff during stop-overs was perfect. I enjoyed the mix of Asian and European meals very much. Just a note to mention that, inside the airplane, the A330 was much quieter than the Boeing 777. The choice of entertainment options was a bit limited but I spent most of my time reading, working and sleeping, so no complaint. The only difficulty I encountered is when I tried to advance my return flights from Sydney to Geneva by one day. China Southern asked me to pay and extra AUS$3700 to do this - it was about the cost of my ticket, so I dropped the idea. For any long-haul traveler from Europe to Australia, I strongly recommend this airline. Only a footnote on another passenger's remark: the seats 4A/4K are actually fine on both versions A330. I would not recommend the seats 4B or 4J on the A330-200 which are too close to the galley and bathroom.",Business Class,5,5,5,3,5,yes,522,A330-300 / A330-200,Business,AMS to SYD via CAN,December 2015,5,,China Southern Airlines,China

Flights were half empty and average amount of food and drinks. My only issue is the entertainment. Really shocked at the lack of films and TV. I personally wouldn't of been able to fill my time on both flights watching something that interests me. I fell asleep for a lot of the journey so it wasn't an issue. Very happy overall.

The food was okay, entertainment was ok, and they were good with snacks and bringing drinks round to keep you hydrated. The second from Guangzhou to Bangkok was on a Boeing 737-800 with much better leg room and comfortable seats for this 3hr flight - limited entertainment, food served was inedible. I would recommend China Southern Airlines on price and a fairly new fleet of planes, and the service is also okay.

The outbound domestic stretch was delayed due to ATC, but crew promptly started drink service and entertainment to keep everyone happy and occupied. Entertainment was shown over a screen, with a mixture of Chinese and Western content. Crew was happy to provide an extra share of food if they had some remaining, but I think the share is ample for most people. Of the three major Chinese airlines, China Southern is best in terms of service and value of money. The airline offer a free hotel stay for transfers over 8 hours at CAN. The counter at Gate 20 could use some directions, and more staff to handle the bookings. Was given a well furnished hotel room to rest during this time.

The entertainment included a wider-than-usual range of English language material compared with other Asian airlines I have traveled with. The headphones, blankets and pillows were pretty basic. The food was adequate but not as good as other airlines I have used recently.

I tried to change my return leg from starting at Bangkok to staring at Phuket. There are neither ticketing agents in the Bangkok airport, nor is there a viable way to modify the tickets online. I purchased the tickets business class directly through China Southern Airlines webpage. That was actually very simple.

In terms of the seats of business class, I was quite happy to notice that the airline add a net in the gap between the seat and the armrest where passengers could easily drop their stuff into and hard to get them out. Although it can't be compared with fine dinning, I'm satisfied with the food I had during the flight. I really like the Boeing 787 cabin, it's quiet, steady and comfortable.

We took our seats on the flight and a family with two children boarded business class, they were extremely loud the whole journey and I was unable to sleep. Their family member also continually joined them from further back in the plane. This meant that five people were in an area set for four which contributed to the noise. The flight attendants also took many pictures of the children and I assume this was for promotional purposes. The whole reason for taking a business flight and paying the extra is to be able to sleep and go straight to meetings. I waited for the children to sleep, they didn't. So after four hours I asked the attendant to move us. She said the flight was full, I said no one is in first class, can you either move the family there or us? She said she can't as the other attendants were sleeping. Eventually she agreed to let me go into first class but not my husband.

A crew member offered to help me and my mother lift our carryon suitcases into the overhead lockers.  The timing of meal times were a bit weird though because after 2 hours that the flight took off at 00:30am China time, dinner was served. Both dinner and breakfast allowed passengers to choose from either a beef meal or a different one. It was not appetizing for me to eat cold fruit, sweet dessert, hot beef noodles so late in the night. Our seats were situated at the first row of a section of the plane, where we were facing a wall. The seats were comfortable. There was a lot of foot space and the best thing about our seats was that we could lower our chair without pushing back onto the passengers behind us.  It was the first time ever that I was able to sleep properly on a flight. The TV was inside the right arm rest and the table was in the left arm rest. There were many new movies from different countries such as chinese and hollywood movies and music. However, there barely any variety shows or dramas that you can really choose from. The Dramas are mostly American dramas, each one only has 3-4 episodes to choose from. The beef noodles were way too salty so I gave up on that and ate the bread, the bread was my favourite food. Our plane ticket was quite expensive due to the fact that my mum decided to book 6 days before christmas day, but I can assume that if you book earlier in the year the flights should be much cheaper.

Food was mediocre and they ran out of my first choice of meals because I was in the last row (seat 14A.) IFE had older movies. My seatmate was this father traveling with his family. He talked loudly to his family in the row ahead of us when he was awake and snored when sleeping. They also had visitors from economy come in and sit with them. Flight attendants spoke English but I still had difficulty making myself understood. They completely disappeared between the first and second meals. Consistent with my experience living in Hong Kong, it was hard to impress upon the flight attendants that I wanted a lot of ice with my soda.

I flew at Christmas with China Southern Airlines, having previously only flown either economy with the bigger carriers like Qantas, Singapore, Emirates and Cathay and First class with Emirates and Qantas. I have to say that dollar-wise it was great value; the return trip was AU$5,800 at Christmas; comparable Qantas flights with a similar time were around $9,000. The highlights were that I had a spare seat next to me on every single flight which was unexpected. The seats were fantastic, very comfortable and comparable to both Emirates (First class) and better than Qantas First in my opinion. The airport lounge at Sydney was fine, just a generic lounge with all that you need, the Lounge at Heathrow was awesome with great food and drink. The lounge at Guangzhou was very good with great facilities but limited food that did not appeal. The food on the flight was fairly okay, nothing amazing apart from one eye fillet of beef out of China which was superb. The inflight entertainment was average but not great compared to the choice of other major carriers. Wine selection onboard was terrible, literally two types of Chardonnay and two types of Pino, I opted for the red because I hate Chardy and it was very nice - a NZ I believe. The crew were helpful when I needed them but that wasn't very much. The flight was smooth, on-time and the cabin was immaculate on all three planes. It was nice to fly on their A380 and Boeing 787 too, I landed very refreshed.

The food was okay, but while the thin plastic cutlery was okay for spooning in veg and mashed potatoes, the chicken could not be cut - no elbow room and the knife would break, so had to be picked up and ate by hand. They do allow passengers a free hotel if more than hours in Guangzhou, but you will spend 2 hours in line waiting firstly to get into the Immigration hall and then to the desk. Another annoying thing about the Boeing 787 design is that instead of having normal window blinds, they have tinted windows - when its 5pm having flown east through 8 time zones the outside world looks like night time, so you lose out on any daylight apart from touchdown.",Economy Class,1,3,2,4,2,no,617,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,LHR to MNL via CAN,March 2016,1,,China Southern Airlines,China

The stewardesses were friendly, courteous, and some even have an element of cheek that I hadn't seen on Asian airlines. There was a good amount of leg room and it turned out to be quite comfortable. There was a much improvement in the selection of entertainment on individual screens, although they were on the small side compared to other major airlines. The food is reasonable, and cooked to the perfect amount: vegetables were still crisp! There was two hot meal services on this flight. The only minor drawback was the fact that my luggage was not tagged as priority, despite using priority check-in with my Oneworld Emerald status (Ticket bought through Qantas under a QF flight number).

I also did it I first flew to South East Asia, and that worked for my first two flights. But this data was lost yet again on my flights back and had to request mileage for those flights.

2016-03-21,"""certainly a value option""",7,"China Southern had some amazing offers for flights to Thailand so we booked for £357 per person which is the cheapest ever in the 6 times we have been to Thailand. I booked the flights through the China Southern website, and the process was straight forward. After booking I got the option to reserve seats, that was a little bit a struggle. Whilst I was able to prebook seats from Heathrow to Guangzhou and the return flight Bangkok - Guangzhou - Heathrow, I was for 100+ days all the way up to departure unable to book seats for the Guangzhou-Bangkok leg of our journey - error message. No seat map available for B737. Getting in touch with their China based customer service was no help, I was multiple times advised to keep on trying in January (that was in February). So customer service clearly a challenge.  The airline uses the Boeing 787 for the route between Heathrow and Guangzhou. Nice plane, good climate and electronically dimming windows. The inflight entertainment was great with all the latest blockbusters incl. SPECTRE, Star Wars and a few Oscar winning movies, but also less recent international movies incl. half of the James Bond collection. I was expecting a more Asian centered collection but I was positively wrong.  Whilst it is nice to have a new plane it does have its flaws though - the biggest one being the super hard seats which, for a 12 hour flight, are truly a pain. Seat space seems to be measured for smaller people, not ideal especially in conjunctuion with the hard seat. Also the electronically managed window blinds mean that they can be locked / controlled centrally which removes all flexibility from the passenger. Over frozen Siberia and also the northern part of China I would have loved to have a look outside but that was impossible whilst windows were centrally tinted and individual control was suspended. Another disappointment was the selection of food. On both, the flight to and from Bangkok, the airline ran out of western food leaving the predominantly western passengers stranded with smelly fish dishes. Very disappointing! For the 2-3 hr journey between Bangkok and Guangzhou, a Boeing 737 with more legroom and softer seats. That was a joy - but no in-flight entertainment. There is no WiFi service onboard their aircraft. Transit at Guangzhou was smooth, however the change of terminals was managed via 15 mins bus shuttle across airport. Terminals are well maintained with souvenir shops and drinking water fountains.  Overall good value for money, as frequent flyers between London and Bangkok, China Southern is certainly a value option we will continue to consider. However, the hard seats especially on the longer leg of the journey are real challenge. In overall rating I am also deducting stars for food selection.",Economy Class,2,4,3,5,5,yes,635,Boeing 787-800,Couple Leisure,LHR to BKK via CAN,March 2016,4,,China Southern Airlines,China

I was upgraded to Premium economy at check in, the cabin looked nice, legroom in the cabin brilliant and worth having on a long haul flight. A 2-4-2 layout onboard the A33o-200, and the seat was comfortable. AVOD box underneath the seat did not bother me. Meals were decent - standard Economy class meal is served in Premium Economy. IFE system onboard the A330 was slightly inferior to that onboard the Boeing 787, but provides decent selection of movies, TV shows, music nonetheless. I have watched most of the TV shows on the flight from London to Guangzhou so did not use the IFE much. Use of mobile phones was prohibited though throughout the flight, even with flight mode on. Cabin crew friendly and attentive and have provided professional service. Landed at AKL about 20 minutes late.

This was my first journey with China Southern and my choice to fly with them was principally made on price-point. The cost of flights for my wife and me on China Southern were around 60% of the best price I could get from BA or Qantas. I was prepared to put up with a possible lower standard of both aircraft and service for the savings. China Southern excelled in every way. All four aircraft on the round-trip were new and extremely well-equipped. Two 787s, an A380 and an A330. Cabin lay-out was excellent for business class passengers. The icing on the cake was the cabin service. It was, without exception, courteous and attentive without being over-precious. The cabin crew on the CZ302 flight on 19 March out of Sydney was without doubt the best I've ever flown with (better than any of the first class flights I've taken with other airlines). We were made to feel special, comfortable, and cared for in a way I wish other airlines would emulate.

First leg a pretty new aircraft, second leg an older one, both clean and the toilets kept clean during the flight. Full flat horizontal seats on both. Easy check-in and boarding. Very helpful, polite and accommodating crew. Food was a mixed bag, western and Chinese options. Some good, some we had to pass. Plenty of drinks and water offered, but sometimes the white wine was not cold enough in the plane and the Guangzhou lounge. On the way to Frankfurt you have to know, that you have to immigrate technically into China in Guangzhou. You get a 24hr Visa on the spot. Then the next flight is a short domestic flight to Changsha where you leave the plane, a U-turn at the gate and depart China. Same plane from Changsha to Frankfurt. Not a big deal, but a surprise.

I prefer A380 as its privacy of business class is better than Boeing 777 and the layout is more reasonable. The cabin staff speak English quite well. I thought the food taste is not as satisfactory as I imagine - the original flavor has all gone. Another thing is that when I was booking the flight on the official website, I found that when I switched the language to English, the price changed and the whole booking procedure has turned to be extremely complicated. The webpage layout was really confusing, the membership rewards system was imperfect with many restrictions when trying to spend these points, which was not as good as those provided by American airline companies.

2016-04-07,"""exceptional value for money""",9,"✅ Verified Review |  Overall I was very pleased with the China Southern flight from Sydney to Heathrow with a 5 hour stopover at Guangzhou. We requested the 'bland meal' and they lived up to their reputation (with no chilli or spices due to my partner having an allergic reaction to chilli) but all meals were edible and included a plain side salad and fruit. We were even brought 'bland' snacks during the night - a tuna salad sandwich. The drinks were plentiful although the coffee is not for connoisseurs! The toilets were kept clean and supplied. The inflight entertainment was great although the quality of sound through the headsets can be poor. The seating arrangements are definitely better on the A330 with a 2-4-2 configuration so couples can sit together and appear to have more legroom. The crew on the flight spoke English and the announcements were good although they were poor on our outward flight from Guangzhou to Sydney several months earlier. The only drawbacks we found would be the longish stopover in Guangzhou (but we paid to use the lounge using Priority Pass) and the bus from the gate to the plane - and subsequent climb up a set of steps. I'm sure arrangements were made for less able passengers but the bus was a free for all and the steps could be daunting. However, overall, I would definitely use China Southern again as they offer exceptional value for money, and the airline's 2 x 23kg luggage allowance for economy passengers is great.

Free transportation to and from the hotel, plus free breakfast. Very, very nice! What I will warn about is the overweight baggage fees and the useless web site and China Southern contact. I tried to purchase excess weight for the baggage before the flight (I knew I was overweight), but the web site is useless for that, good luck. I tried to call for help, and no one answered over multipleattempts; just recordings in Chinese. I finally gave up, figuring it couldn't be that much, right? $25-$50, something like that, at the most. This part was my fault, I should have read what the charges were going to be on their web site, it was over $160 US for a few kilos over weight. I kid you not! And no credit cards accepted, Cash only. I could have choked the condescending clerk at the Phnom Penh airport as he rejected my US $20 dollar bills because they were not in perfect condition. I finally threw my entire wad of cash on the counter and told him to pick the ones he wanted; I was so angry and frustrated, that he scurried off with the bills he had and came back with my receipt.

Within an hour we were in a decent hotel, provided lunch and dinner, and were taken back to the airport one hour before rescheduled departure time. Boarding commenced on time and moreover, we were given equivalent of 30USD cash compensation. I wish this kind of delay management becomes standard in China Southern.

On time departure and arrival. Onboard food is getting worse on CZ flights. Since last year they serve only bottled water on flights below 2 hours. Explanation is lack of time for full bar service, which was not a problem 2 years ago? The reason is cost cutting but they wouldn't admit. Entertainment on ceiling displays every 4 rows or so, however on many flights without sound. Crew well groomed, polite and smiling, however they only greet personally their Chinese frequent fliers. I guess they're afraid of speaking in English. To be fair, sometimes you can encounter FAs with excellent English command. The economy seats on their smaller planes are OK for shorter flights, however on flights of more than 2 hours they become very uncomfortable. The seat back padding is so thin that you feel like resting on wood. They have been using the same type seats for ages, even on brand new aircrafts.

Yes, your ticket is one of the cheapest out there but why make us suffer. Some of us want to sit together or get good seats but we cannot do so unless we go to the counter extremely early. I hope they resolve this issue. Seats on the first leg, I was lucky enough to get an exit row, window seat on the (Boeing 737) It was pretty comfortable and spacious. The food was average and the service was okay as well. Seats on the second leg were on the upperdeck (A380), this was pretty good as well. I was able to doze off. The entertainment system was also good. Wish they had a phone charger too, like a USB outlet. Food was again average - nothing to WOW to me. The service here was much better though. They also handed out amenity kits which were pretty useful. I have to say I love the A380, flight was great! Very smooth and almost no turbulence at all.  What I don't like would be that the staff doesn't go around to serve snacks while mid-way through the flight. You wouldn't know your options unless you asked them. Plus the snack choices were limited - sandwiches and instant noodles. Check in on both planes were good and very smooth.

Staff are very polite but I have never been addressed by name on any CZ flights.  The chicken option from the menu turned out to be very delicious! The seat is quite spacious but not comfortable, CZ utilizes the same seat type for years. The current footrest is a joke - too far away and too low to put your feet on.

The business class seats of Boeing 787 has large space, and maybe the cheap ticket price of the flight made the plane totally full without any vacant seat! Unfortunately there was something wrong with my seat during the flight, and it doesn't work. We wanted to change but there was no empty seat for me.

As I sit on the plane for the flight from Chongqing to Shanghai PuDong without moving for 90mins (last week it was 3hrs before we moved) I remember that travelling China Southern is most likely for delays and worst of all, are most likely to board you then do nothing for hours.

When I got onboard the economy class was full of passengers and I really needed some good rest, so after I checked the cost of the onboard upgrade (which was quite fair), I decided to have myself a treat. Once I seated in the business class, the flight attendant attended me so kindly and nicely. I got the champagne, I got the hot towel. The flight was great, the flight attendant can speak good English, the food was ok, the drinks was nice, but after we got disembarked, we were trapped in the Guangzhou Immigration and Quarantine.

2016-04-19,"""unacceptable for business class""",2,"✅ Verified Review |  A few complaints about my flight from San Francisco to Bangkok via Guangzhou. On the way, one of my two pieces of luggage was delayed by 24 hours! This meant I had to miss my Bangkok tour while I waited for it to arrive. Traveling through China was a disaster. I thought it was nice that they escorted me from the airplane to the China Southern lounges, but they refused to let me explore the airport (felt like they were keeping me prisoner) and the food was of low quality. This became an issue when I had to spend 6 hours in Guangzhou. Additionally, they escorted me about 3/4 mile on foot to the domestic airport only to realize that they had taken me to the wrong lounge. They then made me walk all the way back to the international airport to the lounge there. Also, getting seat assignments ahead of time was really difficult, as I had to call China! Lastly, the gluten-free meals consisted of sushi shrimp (ugh) and other weird items. The good news was the business-class seats for the overseas portion were really nice and the staff was pleasant. But when I got home, it took 1 hour for them to unload my luggage! This applied to everyone who had a stopover in China. Again, unacceptable for business class and the agent at SFO was not at all pleasant.

2016-04-20,"""very friendly and attentive""",8,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew China Southern Airlines from Seoul to Singapore via Guangzhou on Business Class. It was overall satisfying experiences, especially the Guangzhou to Singapore sector (CZ3039) - the biz tickets were available at an incredibly affordable price. Great value for money. Lounge-style check-in counter dedicated for biz/first class at Guangzhou airport.  No queue at all. Business/First class lounge was above average. There were more choices for lunch than many other airline lounges, offering Chinese delicacy. Seats were something that let me down. An old style chair with a limited recline capacity. Flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. A senior female flight attendant cared about passenger needs throughout the flight with smile. As I am studying Mandarin, I tried to use my still poor Mandarin. She was very patient and continued to have conversations in Mandarin. The quality of inflight meal was satisfying, although not outstandingly exceptional, it was a solid, well-prepared meal. It would have been better, if there was nice ice cream available at the end of the meal. Overall, it was totally different from insipid, discouraging economy class meals in some Chinese airlines. Very few choices for in-flight entertainment. No news, and, no real-time navigational map. In the end, I ended up finishing reading a book.

2016-04-23,"""disappointed by ground service""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Auckland via Guangzhou with China Southern. Overall a nice onboard experience, with friendly and attentive cabin crew. The ticket was good value for money. I would travel on this airline again. I had ordered gluten free meals, and on both legs of the journey, when I got on board, a crew-member came to see me and make sure of my order. The meals prepared in London were good, but the meals prepared in Guangzhou were not up to the same standard. Refreshments were served regularly on both flights. I found the economy seat cushion on the 787 aircraft to be less comfortable than the economy seat of the China Southern 777 that I had previously flown on. Seat 53A is offset from the window, so you have to lean forward to get a view of the ground below, but it means that there is some extra storage space between the seat and the cabin wall. The on-board entertainment had a good range to choose from, but I mostly listened to my own music and read a book. I was disappointed by the ground service in Guangzhou, where I had a 7.5 hour layover, and hoped to be able to leave the terminal on a transit visa and see a little of the city, like the China Southern web site seemed to say that I could. There were several other plane-loads of transit passengers to be processed, and only three desks open. It took well over an hour standing in a queue before I had my onward boarding pass stamped, and then there was no obvious way to leave the airport - no directions or signage, and no information from the staff that processed me. I ended up wandering around the terminal until my next flight. The free WiFi in the airport worked fine (look for the machines that read your passport and issue a password), although it seemed that some web sites were blocked. I was able to use VPN and RDS to get to Facebook. Prior to the trip I had a great deal of difficulty with the English version of the China Southern Airlines web site. Even though I could identify myself by e-ticket and name, it insisted on me entering a verification code sent to me by SMS - but it would only accept mainland China mobile phone numbers! Very, very frustrating! I found that I could do more by putting the Chinese version of the web site through Google Translate, but in the end I had to make my meal and seat reservations by email through their Auckland office. China Southern, if you are reading this review, you must make your English web site much more usable for people who live outside of China!!",Economy Class,3,5,4,,5,yes,686,Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,LHR to AKL via CAN,April 2016,2,,China Southern Airlines,China

As for the food and wine, although the wine list is small, it was well chosen, I had a couple of Boudreaux and a lovely Chablis, contrary to other comments they did offer Champagne. The food was okay, given the fact the cost of the fare I paid was half that of the othe more glamorous Asian airlines, it was a reasonable selection. And of course the quality of the Chinese cuisine was superior, yes the croissants were a tad over done. Ground staff were obliging and helpful, the lounges were perfectly fine and restful.

On my flight from Guangzhou to London I paid to be upgraded from Economy Class to Business Class. This turned out to be a good deal as it's cheaper to upgrade from Economy to Business than to buy a Business Class ticket in the first instance. Although this option doesn't include Business Class food I was given Business Class food anyway, which was very good. Boeing 787 cabin has a lot of space where I could relax and the entertainment system has a wide selection of options to choose from. The flight attendant service was excellent. I was impressed by how clean the bathroom was. During the descent they gave me an express pass, which saved me a lot of time. However I don't understand is why we had to turn our phones off as a lot of European airlines allow passengers to keep their phones on for the duration of the flight.

2016-05-08,"""FA cared well for passengers""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  Ho Chi Minh City to Manila return via Guangzhou with China Southern. All flights on smaller, narrow body aircrafts with only 8-12 seats in business. International transfer in CAN is easier than in Beijing. Check-in in at all airports went smoothly - staff were polite, advisory, and correct. On these 4 flights only one small delay of 30 minutes which is bearable as it was early and clearly announced. China Southern Airlines regional flights are far from luxurious and not as pampering for passengers compared to their international/continental flights. Lounge provision worked well. 5 star hotel provided in Guangzhou (HJ Grand 15 Mins from Airport). In the narrowbody cabins, there were nice seats, but old business class style (recliners only). Food not very good and rated as mediocre - only 2 options given, despite they often claim a third option, which does not seem available if you order it. Only Chinese cuisine offered, which is not my favourite (greasy noodles, tasteless dim sum). Hot dishes were served in foils like economy class. No food nor drink menu cards were provided. No amenity kit provided, but given new slippers and a nice shoe-bag with shoe-horn. Newspapers given. As pre-departure drink only non-alcoholic beverages offered. Hot towels given. Onboard no champagne, only one white and one red-wine (French country wine, substandard). They ran out of beer and had only Yinjang beer onboard. FA cared well for passengers, though poor in English. IFE content was quite OK and easy to manoeuvre. Service shortened by putting on seat-belt signs far too much – thus, discontinued 40 minutes before landing and only started after 25 minutes airborne. Priority of luggage handling, check-in, boarding, lounge access, and transit, were all perfectly implemented and prioritised for premium cabin travellers. I noted that economy travellers were also well taken care of in transit. All in all the product is quite acceptable and the price was considerably lower than any other airline for this route except for Cebu pacific which I consider as an LCC; and Malaysia Airlines which have now gone dry on all domestic and regional flights. China Southern is a class or two higher compared to Air China regional business class which I travelled in a few months earlier.

Lounge experience rather mediocre. The aircraft was Embraer 90, which offers very comfy seats in business class. Overall impression was spoiled by poor onboard service from a female purser: cold and unfriendly welcome, despite on time boarding no pre flight drinks, not addressing passengers by names, rushed service etc. Meals orders collected (""beef noodles or snacks"" - looks like it is a standard now on this route regardless of time of day). It is mandatory for FAs on China Southern flights to ask passengers whether they would like to be woken up for meals in case of falling asleep but it was not the case on this flight. I fell asleep indeed and woke up on landing announcements. Requested the meal, the purser reluctantly served it saying ""you have to be quick!"". Noodles turned out to be dried out on top and very greasy under, so I just stayed hungry after finishing nuts, yoghurt and fruit.

I was pleased with my upgrade. This is my first long haul flight so I had no idea what to expect. My new seat was excellent, the service was prompt and efficient, and I had a good flight. I had a hiccup with luggage due to the short turnaround in China however, it was rectified as expediently as possible.

2016-06-21,"""cabin crew struggle in English""",6,"✅ Verified Review |  A recent trip gave us the chance to fly China Southern on a handful of routes in both economy and business. The business class offerings truly appealed. Our earlier flight from JFK to CAN was a reasonably smooth affair on excellent hardware. The business class beds are comfortable and the overnight schedule offered in both directions mean that you can easily sleep at least half the way and arrived refreshed. China Southern service, on the other hand, remained an awkward surprise. After all the enormous investment in the planes themselves, alongside the airline’s ranking as the single largest in Asia, our experience on both flights across the Pacific was that the majority of cabin crew struggle in English. Routine requests about meal schedules met with friendly but persistent miscommunications. Service itself would begin and then lapse – dinner on our return stretched out over a lengthy two hours as attendants would begin, then work with others, then show up twenty minutes later with cutlery, only to disappear again. The airline appears to let passengers pre-order their menu choices, a wonderful option, though it was unavailable to us despite repeated efforts with apps, online, and even in person at the China Southern desk in Guangzhou, days ahead of the flights in question. This option perhaps constrains the actual choice of meals remaining as we were unable to receive either our on-board dinner or breakfast choices on both business flights. Food itself was good, though the much touted Beef Noodle Soup ensemble was a disappointment, perhaps too hard to master high up in the air. We would gladly fly China Southern again for its comfortable beds, but as far as making the flight a truly enjoyable experience, there is a long way to go.",Business Class,5,3,3,4,4,yes,756,,Couple Leisure,CAN to JFK,June 2016,3,,China Southern Airlines,China
2016-06-22,"""our flight was a letdown""",4,"✅ Verified Review |  Having experienced some of the highs of China Southern service on its trans-Pacific routes, our flight from Chiang Mai to Guangzhou was a letdown. At check-in, the airline curiously used screen banners for China Eastern (?) and only a single sheet of paper marked “CZ3034” clued us to our flight. There was no Sky Priority lane, and the gate agent was unable to provide us boarding passes for our connecting Guangzhou flight. Likewise at boarding, there was a single general call - no parents with children, no premium cabin, no Sky Priority lane. Our Boeing 737 was comfortable and the cabin crew seemingly expert. We were surprised by the meal service on this 2.5 hour flight. Our meal box contained a lifeless bread bun in plastic, a small square of dry cake in plastic, a small yogourt drink, and a single plum that was (thankfully) edible. Having been spoiled on earlier China Southern economy routes on evening flights at the same time, we were sorry we had left room for dinner!",Economy Class,3,4,1,2,4,yes,757,,Couple Leisure,CNX to CAN,June 2016,1,,China Southern Airlines,China

2016-06-23,"""still recommend this airline""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Singapore to Vancouver via Guanzhou. First time flying out of Asia and I have to say that going to Vancouver was smooth. Connecting to Guangzhou was a breeze and China Southern ground staff you show you directions. However, there was no sense of order such a queueing as the Chinese passengers would cut queues when getting on to plane. The rest of us foreigners could only look on bewilderment at the unorganized queue. There was a delay of 2h 30 mins on the tarmac due to bad weather. Cabin crew was friendly and would adhere to requests and worked well under pressure. They tried to appease us by serving drinks. However, there was 1 stewardess that always had a bitchy face and no smile at all. Meals were served about an hour after takeoff and 6 hours after take off. Food was excellent. Stir fried chicken with veggies and rice with a suprising dessert of a lemon flavoured cake! The other meal I had was a western meal of beef and potatoes. Entertainment system was up to date with the latest movies. I sat at the window seat. Seats reclined well and ample space for my feet. However, I didnt get enough rest as there was a ""devil"" child seating behind me thus lack of sleep. I feel that the cabin crew should have taken intiative to tell the parents to make their children behave as it can be quite an inconvience to us adults. Especially when we dont wish to offend the parents. Flying from Vancouver to Guangzhou was a hiccup. Flight was delayed for 1h 30mins due to insufficient documents to the control tower before take off. By the time I reached Guangzhou, my flight to Singapore has left. China Southern was kind enough to put me on the earliest flight the next day and reimbursed my stay in Guangzhou with a hotel of choice given. Overall, this return ticket that I purchase was definitely value for money. I would still recommend this airline despite the minor hiccups along the way as they've did their best to appease the passengers.",Economy Class,5,4,5,5,5,yes,760,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,SIN to YVR via CAN,June 2016,5,,China Southern Airlines,China

In-flight entertainment system was updated and offered a variety of choices. My wife and I had both ordered special meal - cabin crew were aware of our special order and taste of food was good. Late supper/ dinner was served after 1.5 hours since departure and a breakfast was served 3 hours before landing so the interval between meals was reasonable. Water was served  in between meals, and night snack was available upon request. Toilet was clean even though the flight was quite full.

I would have given a higher score but several flights I took with China Southern Airlines recently were delayed for an extended period of time.

The seats were narrow and I could hardly get in and out of my seat space wise during flight. The food was alright but not very filling and often there was no choice as they ran out. On an 11 hr flight two meals were offered, was water offered between meals, no snacks were offered. The inflight entertainment was located on the inside of the armrest and the system was difficult to use. Facilities at Guangzhou airport were minimal and after paying nearly $70 for two hours in a premium lounge in a 7hr stopover, I decided to decline this on the return flight. Instead I asked at the information desk if I had enough airmiles to upgrade on the last leg. The assistant assured me that I did and she tapped into the computer and said it was done and my seat had been upgraded.

But no airline can match China Southern in the generosity of baggage allowance: I got the already high standard allowance of 2 pieces of 23 kg, plus another free piece (as I flew to the Netherlands as a student). The free hotel for my long transit in Guangzhou - at Dong Fang Hotel was a bonus. The hotel is near a subway line, perfect for exploring the main tourist attractions of the city with the free metro card the airlines gives you. I had actually booked the transit hotel through China Southern's website, but they overwrote that at the airport - let the airline organise the transit for you when you get to the airport. The main drawback was Guangzhou Airport: limited and overpriced food, unclear signage for getting your 24-hour visa free transit and hotel, and the biggest shocker - portable toilets you normally find on work sites or music festivals!

2016-10-01,"""happy with the price I paid""",9,"✅ Verified Review |  Auckland to New York JFK via Guangzhou. Checking in and boarding at AKL were effortless - my bags were checked all the way to JFK and I was able to change seats into the front Business cabin, which is much better than the rear one. On the plane I was welcomed and addressed by name through both flights. The seat was very comfortable (made more so by having the adjacent seat empty). Take off on time. Gate to gate IFE, although I had to ask for headphones (medium quality noise-cancelling). Cabin staff asked for drink and meal orders before take off for both meals. She also asked whether I'd like to be woken for both meals. I had pre-ordered by the website (not easy to do, the CZ website is not easy to negotiate). Meals were both good - probably not as good as other full service carriers in Business, but I was satisfied. Wine selection was fine. Service was speedy for a 2300hrs departure, then off to sleep. Lie flat seat wasn't bad for sleeping, but would have benefited from a small mattress. Cabin temperature was perfect for me (probably a little chilly for most); the duvet provided was awesome - doubled as a sort of mattress if you didn't need it for warmth. Cabin staff were very quiet during the night, but were available for anything that I wanted. We arrived into Guangzhou early. Very speedy exit from the plane, and then taken by coach to customs and immigration. As promised, there was an airline rep who had a board with my name, and she shadowed me all the way through everything. China Southern provided a hotel room and the agent even helped me check in. The Pullman hotel had dreadful systems and it took an hour to find me a room. The second flight to JFK did not begin well. Cabin staff were down at least 1 person and it took 3 attempts to get headphones and he got confused about taking drink orders. We left almost on time (about 8 minutes late). The seat belt in Business on the Boeing 777 almost cut my neck until I figured a way to wear it only as a lap belt - this needs to be altered. Meals were same quality as the first leg - but plenty of courses, so when some things weren't to my taste, it didn't matter. Great self-serve snack bar in flight. Got a really good sleep - very comfortable. When I awoke, they had just finished the second meal, but the cabin staff were great - they waited for me to wake and then served me without rushing. Overall the IFE wasn't great - no box sets just occasional episodes. Movies not really to my taste, but I can't really blame the airline for that. Arrived into JFK early - but were kept hanging about waiting for ground control. Very speedy bag delivery. It's a long way to get to New York via China, but the competitive Business class fare (almost half what other airlines were charging when I booked it) made it an easy choice. While the product wasn't always perfect, there was quite sufficient to make me very happy with the price I paid. I arrived far, far fresher than I do when I choose premium economy or economy on other airlines. It is 36 hours with stop over, but if time isn't an issue for you and you want Business class comfort, this is a good option.",Business Class,4,4,3,3,5,yes,843,Boeing 787 / 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,AKL to JFK via CAN,September 2016,5,,China Southern Airlines,China

As the transit passenger, I flew from Beijing to GuangZhou on 2nd October. I called Customer Services Team at Melbourne Office in different occasions to confirm my transit hotel arrangement, but none of these occasions the customer services staff has informed me that I need to book the preferred hotel via CZ online system, hence, when I got to GuangZhou on 2nd October in the evening, the nearest hotel has been booked out (15 rooms in total according to the staff). Then I was sent to Dong Fang hotel which was 40 minutes away from the airport. According to China Southern Airlines website and ground staff, it’s a 5 Star hotel, I have to say, not sure where these 5 stars come from, it was worse than a zero star motel. The room is dirty with very strong moldy smell, the staff poor, it was not a good place to stay. As for the ground transit staff, please improve your customer services skills and please learn from the cabin staff.

Service from the attentive cabin crew was friendly and efficient, and the food was well above average, with a wide range of options; wine choice was more limited but of good quality. Toilets were kept clean. The inflight entertainment was average, but I rarely bother with inflight movies anyway and prefer listening to my own music, so this wasn't an issue for me. The business class cabin was barely half full on this sector and the window shades were down throughout the flight, so the atmosphere was very quiet and comfortable.

2016-10-17,"""good value for business class""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  In October 2016 my colleague and I flew China Southern business class to Amsterdam from Auckland via Guangzhou, for approx fourth time in 3 years (and second time this year). Overall it's good value for business class travellers, with the odd minor annoyance. The 12 hour leg from Auckland to China is generally not full but often the European leg is busier. The quality of cabin service is highly variable depending on English skills and training of staff. One annoying feature is the preferred meal selection are very seldom available, and the remaining meal choice can be quite inedible, and in general insufficient numbers of best meals are allocated (eg China Southern Beef noodle soup, and Al Brown designed meals). This seriously needs sorting out as paying business class flyers should get their choice of meals. Allegedly you can pre book meals on the China Southern website but how many business class travellers have got time to muck around with this, especially when the website is really hard to navigate. The flight connections to and from Auckland are not that great either, with 6 to 8 hour stopover in China which extends the trip substantially. The VIP bus from the plane is a good service, as exiting make sure you follow the hostess carefully to the transit desk area. However, the China Southern International lounge is disappointing (unless you are able to get into the Elite section) as the air-conditioning cannot cope with the heat and humidity, and lounge staff are disinterested in general, and slow to clean the showers and make these available. However, these annoyances aside the business class lie flat seats are damn good and timing reliable so it's simple to get a good sleep and arrive in Europe for business relatively refreshed at 0645 Monday - for half the price of AirNZ business class !

But as for the really competitive price (CNY 4700 round trip from Shanghai to New York via Guangzhou departed on National Day Holiday), all the negative facts were acceptable.

2017-01-02,"""good and friendly service""",7,"✅ Verified Review |  Guangzhou to Shanghai. China Southern's domestic and regional flights are a far cry from their fine international offerings. You get a good experience for a good price. The crew doesn't speak English very well, but it was no problem, and they were enthusiastic and helpful. The beverage selections are limited, but the crew chief made me a black coffee (instant) special rather than pour the sugared swill from the jug. The boxed snack is atrocious - don't eat it, but bring your own snacks. The inflight entertainment is good, though you may have to ask for a replacement set of the cheap headphones (or again, bring your own). On the whole, the negatives about China Southern's domestic service are expected, and on-par with their competitors. The positives are good and friendly service from attentive staff, good prices, and reliable scheduling.

2017-01-07,"""crew were outstanding""",9,"✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Auckland via Guangzhou with China Southern. Check-in at LAX was speedy and efficient. The person on the desk could answer all my questions and make the changes that I wanted. The lounge at LAX is not great - I wish that they would look into using another lounge. Boarding was straight-forward and I was directed to my seat. The 1-2-1 layout on the A380 is great - I had a window seat and it was very private. Amenity kit was great. CZ offer slippers in-flight and a useful shoe horn. The Business cabins on the upper floor was almost full, but service was speedy and very pleasant throughout the flight. The only issue I had was that there were some noisy crew during the night flight, but the CSM explained that there had been a couple of medical issues on board and apologies. Meals were of a good standard. I pre-ordered a meal and it arrived as described. On CZ, you have to order your pre-dinner drink and dinner drink at the same time - if you forget, they will bring it to you but always helpful to know. Lots and lots of food at meals and tons of drink and snacks overnight. On arrival at CAN I was met by an airline rep who shepherded me through arrival procedures and took me to check-in at the free hotel for the duration of my stay. Lounge at CAN was fine - upstairs is very restful. Business and First had their own little bus, which was appreciated. On board the second flight, the crew were outstanding - it is a smaller plane and the service was really personalized. I had changed my meal request and didn't confirm it, so it hadn't been loaded, but the duck that I chose was simply outstanding - succulent and tender. Breakfast into Auckland not so good. Snack service overnight was available - lots of things to nibble on. Bed was very comfortable and the duvets are outstanding. I think it helped that the Business cabin was only 2/3 full, but even so - great value for money. The bags I checked in LAX arrived very promptly on arrival in Auckland. If time is not pressing, this is a great choice for travel to LAX and JFK - service is miles ahead of many other airlines on the transpacific route. There is still a little work to do on food and entertainment (they need to have more than 2 episodes of television programmes), but taking into account the price, these are the most minor of issues. I'm looking forward to my next trip to Europe - it will certainly be with CZ, as will my next trip to the US.",Business Class,5,5,4,3,5,yes,926,A380 / Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,LAX to AKL via CAN,December 2016,5,,China Southern Airlines,China

Chinese Government currently forbids the use of mobile phones on flights. No Wifi was available on these flights (would be useless unless they allowed the use of iPads/notebooks, iPhone on flight mode). While their website is in English and Chinese, some email confirmations (like the booking of special seats) arrives only in Chinese. Perth to Guangzhou Premium Economy Flight has sub-standard seats that are just regular Economy seats with more leg space. Their upper deck economy class on the A380 used the same seats as other airlines with the same class, but some of the bins next to windows were being used for airline equipment.

2017-01-08,"""friendly staff on all flights""",8,"✅ Verified Review |  New York to Melbourne return via Guangzhou, four flights in total. Check-in lines and lines to board with this airline are insanely long. There's no rush, however, take your time boarding and remember to check in online in advance to secure the seats you want. The onboard food is decent (typical plane food), though I don't eat certain meats and make sure you request special meals in advance if you are a fussy eater or have certain dietary requirements. The inflight entertainment was much better than other reviews would suggest, including a wide variety of new Hollywood and Chinese films; several movie set marathons also, if you feel in the mood for 14 hours straight of Harry Potter. Hot hand towels are given out during each flight, use these and consider keeping them with you throughout the flight as the toilets did not have hand towels (only tissues) and the soap ran out on all flights. Poor quality of headphones provided, my advice is to bring your own (my iPhone ones worked a treat). Kind, friendly staff on all flights, most with excellent English. All flights departed on time, all arrived early. Quick and easy transfers in Guangzhou to other international flights (no need to go through security again like at many other airports), free wifi (just follow the instructions at one of the small wifi kiosks). JFK to Guangzhou left window exit row seat, and a freezing cold flight (my feet were numb from the cold at one point), though I slept well for most of it, kind, friendly staff who helped find me vegetarian meals when I couldn't eat the meals on offer (my error for not requesting special meals in advance). Guangzhou to Melbourne: aisle seat in middle row and no issues, good flight all round. Melbourne to Guangzhou in a right window seat - the in-flight entertainment had changed since earlier flights I took the previous month. No issues, good flight all round. Guangzhou to JFK with a joke of a boarding process for this flight - everyone lined up an hour before departure, only to be shunted on to buses and driven around the airport in Guangzhou for 15 minutes to find the plane. Not generally an issue, but all passengers then had to walk up 2 flights of external metal stairs and not pleasant for those with a fear of heights or the elderly (one woman looked about 90 and was definitely struggling), young kids, and those with lots of carry-on luggage. Another freezing cold flight. Seats seemed smaller than on other planes with this airline, less leg room, more cramped width-wise. Otherwise, everything else was okay, with good in-flight entertainment.

Our travel agent talked to them confirming these are valid tickets, there is no getting thru to the China Southern Airline staff.  We tried being very friendly, but we got firm and to the point because we weren't getting anywhere - we were just pushed aside and literally ignored when we were being nice.

2017-01-22,"""delightful and helpful cabin crew""",8,"✅ Verified Review |  This was a return flight from London to Christchurch via Guangzhou. China Southern offers several advantages over other airlines; two checked in 23kg bags and a free hotel if the stopover is more than 8 hours. I found the food on these flights to be quite palatable - some nice fish with rice and a black bean type sauce, an egg & bacon roll for breakfast, out of Christchurch and beef with a slightly spiced sauce and some vegetables, followed by fruit, and an omelette and corn and potato fritter for breakfast, out of Guangzhou. The food and drink selection is not great but I have had much worse on other long haul flights and China Southern's seemingly improved offering is perfectly adequate, and for someone who enjoys Asian type foods. For comparison, my experience of BA's economy class is that their food is far worse (often inedible) on long haul flights. But China Southern serves the worst coffee I've ever had anywhere! On the Guangzhou to London flight an amenity kit was provided in a little navy-blue toilet bag, with toothbrush, comb, eyemask and earplugs, to my surprise. The range of inflight entertainment was not vast, but I found a couple of films I hadn't seen and there was enough to keep me amused. The touch screen was very unresponsive to use on the second flight and my own noise-cancelling headphones didn't seem to work vey well with their system. I found both flights quiet, and the mainly Chinese and Asian passengers were extraordinarily well-behaved and polite, as were the delightful and helpful cabin crew. All the cabin crew I met appeared to speak at least some English. I also heard an announcement that said Chinese laws apply and a general warning that anyone causing trouble could be prosecuted, which I've never heard elsewhere on flights. It might help account for passenger's demeanour. The cabin pressure in 787's really does help stave off jet-lag. I feel almost normal after 2 days back, whereas in the past on other flights to NZ I've suffered for weeks. The real downside of these flights is the terrible seat pitch and the discomfort this causes. I'm 174cm tall and I feel that anyone much taller would suffer considerably. If the person in front of you reclines their seat, you have to recline yours or be squashed with the IFE screen 6 inches from your face. Seat pitch should really be regulated internationally to allow enough legroom for passengers. I found the seat width ok, though the seat was very hard. Being forewarned about that, I took an inflatable seat pad with me, but I was in pain throughout the second flight. I had hoped to do some shopping in Guangzhou but the range was very limited and expensive - good for small gifts and Chinese tea but no electronics to speak of, and very limited duty free drink brands.",Economy Class,1,5,4,3,5,yes,949,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,CHC to LHR via CAN,January 2017,5,,China Southern Airlines,China

The flight attendants smiled and provided services and meals. Also, while I took a stopover in Guangzhou, I could feel comfortable at the airport thanks for the nice service. I enjoyed it as well. Lastly, my two luggages safely arrived in my destination, which made me think that I would use this company next time, too. China Southern Airlines was the best airline I've used. They had reasonable prices, superior services, and safety. I really recommend this airline.

2017-01-24,"""not hesitate to use them again""",9,"✅ Verified Review |  I purchased a ticket in August 2016 for a flight from Toronto to Bangkok via Guangzhou. The aircraft flown on long legs of this trip were new clean 777. Seat space in economy for my 5'11"" size was fine and I did not feel cramped. Amenities included a blanket, pillow and earphones although I travel with QC20 to maintain quiet. The food quality on the outbound flight was not very good at all to my taste. On the return flight out of Guangzhou the meals were very good. Juices, beer and wine were served along with dinner. I had learned from the outbound flight that wine is provided in a very small cup, perhaps 2oz. On the return flight I pointed to a juice cup about 7oz. on the trolley and the FA just filled it up with nice red wine and gave me a refill after dinner. Inflight entertainment offered was adequate offering the usual movies, games, music, maps but no outside camera for take off and landing. In addition you cannot use any electronic devices while in flight. Snacks and water were offered during the flight. While some of the FA were not fluent in English, they seemed to know enough basics that you could get by.  A smile and some patience goes a long way. The flights departed close to the scheduled times with the exception of one leg out of BKK which was delayed for an hour. No explanation was given. This put me in a tight situation for my connection in Guangzhou and I explained this to the FA. Shortly before landing she moved me to the front of Premium Economy so I could depart the aircraft quickly. Very nice. I did make my connecting flight. In both the outbound and inbound flights I did not lose my luggage. Check in was smooth and moved along even with long line ups. Guangzhou airport is very large, however I had no problem navigating to my departure gate. I flew the same route last year in economy, transferring in HKG with an upscale airline the ticket was $500 more. China Southern, to my mind, is offering a similar flight experience minus the Hagen Daz ice cream at a great savings and I would not hesitate to use them again.",Economy Class,5,5,4,4,5,yes,956,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Bangkok to Toronto via Guangzhou,January 2017,5,1,China Southern Airlines,China

It is a perfect travel experience of both transfer service and onboard service. Guangzhou airport and the aircraft were decorated because of the coming Chinese lunar new year. The business class lounge had provided an individual bed for me since I had nine hours transit time arriving in Guangzhou. I also enjoyed the fruits and snacks there. After I got onboard, the attendant conformed with me whether I need the wake up service when taking order because she cared about my sleep time in this mid-night flight. The crew were quite lovely and friendly. I love this aircraft design of Boeing 777-300 because I had a good sleep in my lie-flat bed. They offered personalized meal service for me.

China Southern Airlines in the cabin add a small red lantern for the New Year flight home to add a touch of warmth, especially when we first on the plane, also stood New Year's song, to overseas travels feeling has returned to his hometown. But I would like to mention a little suggestion, is to change the screen in the movie or TV drama, because most have seen, do not want to be so boring on the plane. Sometimes want to play online games but often cannot open, hope this can be adjusted and the last hope that China Southern can solve that sometimes children on the machine are very noisy and affect other travelers - consider the children with tourists concentrated in one area. But also help parents communicate. 飛機一路起降也很穩 服务很好 服務態度也不錯 服務也很周到 需要的東西也能及時送到 然後吃的也不错哦 还有丝绒蛋糕還有各種水果 南航在机舱内添加了小红灯笼，给过年时飞回家的人 添了一抹暖意，尤其是當我們剛上飛機的時候，還放著過年的歌，給海外遊子感覺已經回到自己的家鄉。但是我想提一下小小的建議，就是能換一下屏幕裡的電影或者電視劇嗎，因為大部分都看過，不想在飛機上那麼無聊. 有时想玩下聯機遊戲 但是經常打不開，希望可以調整下 最後希望 南航可以解決 有時小孩子在機上很吵 影響到其他旅客 是否可以考慮 帶小孩的旅客集中在一個區域。也有助於家長交流",Economy Class,5,5,5,4,5,yes,959,,Solo Leisure,Melbourne to Tianjin via Guangzhou,January 2017,5,,China Southern Airlines,China

First, the seats armrest is kinda coarse and the seat pocket is tear up etc. Because of the cabin crew is sophisticated, they could easily got what you need and think about.

But the cabin supervisor was so nice, she gave me some fresh fruit from the first class and some vegetable and rice from the crew meal. She told me I should make a phone call or click to the official website to reserve the special meal 24 hours before departure.

This is the worst experience in my flight with China Southern Airlines. The cabin crew informed me the dinner would be served half an hour after took off and I was shocked. In my previous experience, the dinner would be served two hours after took off.  So I asked the cabin crew to serve my dinner after two hours. When they served the dinner, no nut, first dish is cold dish. 20 mins past, no one asked me when to serve the main course, after 23 mins, one cabin crew came to collect the dish and serve the fruit. I asked why fruit goes first without main course and rice? Then they serve the main course with not enough temperature and collected dishes in a hurry. No one ask me when the cheese and dessert would be served, of course I had nothing after main course. In the cruise period, beverage and fruit served on the bar, but no cup or knife displays. How could we drink without cup and have fruit without knife? Other passengers joked the things on the bar is just for display. The most ridiculous thing is no one to replace the toilet paper in time, this brought many trouble to us. For the second dinner, the main course with at the correct temperature. The service of China Southern Airlines is not as good as before, it seems that the cabin crew wanted the passengers to eat in a hurry, then they could finished their service quickly.",Business Class,4,1,1,3,3,no,962,A380,Solo Leisure,Guangzhou to Los Angeles,January 2017,4,,China Southern Airlines,China

However I felt I really got my money's worth. The overnight hotel provided was luxurious (Dragon Lake Princess Hotel), the food was good, the staff at both the airport and the hotel very helpful in assisting with the stopover. The film selection onboard the flight was incredible. Only one bad thing, the economy seats in the Boeing 787 (used for the London-Guangzhou flight) are absolutely tiny - I found that the seats for the much shorter Guangzhou-Taipei flight (A330) were much more comfortable.

The flight was on schedule and the transit procedures were simple. The ground staff and cabin crew were always smiling and friendly to help passengers. When I transit in Guangzhou, I forgot to take my phone, which I was charging by the boarding gate. A ground staff who was so nice brought to the cabin, so the cabin crew can find me through announcement. They really made my day by avoiding me losing confidential and crucial information. I really appreciated it. The A330 was tidy and clean, however the seats were old with a hard cushion that makes me uncomfortable. What's more, my individual TV was out of operation after even several times of reset by cabin crew. Then they gave me an iPad and told me they were offering some pads for passengers in case they met some troubles in their personal TV. I think the company should update the entertainment system to avoid this problem happen again. The food were also good with two meals offered and drinks were not bad.

2017-02-10,"""we would fly China Southern again""",9,"✅ Verified Review |  After reading many very positive reviews we decided to take a chance on flying China Southern from Vancouver to Kathmandu, via Guangzhou. Price for Business Class was much better ($1k better) than other airlines, so we splurged. First, the flights were all on time (some arriving early). Checkin was very fast (being business class certainly made it fast). Business class lie-flat pods quite comfortable. As an aside, peaking into Premium Economy, seats looked pretty decent. Business class food was good to excellent. Drinks not great (see below). Flight attendents all very friendly (most speaking English). Baggage all arrived fine. Business class lounge in Vancouver (not a China Southern lounge) was excellent, the China Southern business class lounge in Guangzhou airport okay, not great but good enough. We're not regular business class travellers, so lounge still seemed a nice perk. Transfer through Guangzhou was easy. On return, we had a long stopover, and received free night in airport hotel (all classes get free hotel, if layover 8 hrs or more). China Southern agent walked us through immigration, arranging the free 24-hr visa with the Chinese immigration agent (agent also did this for passengers in other classes). Then agent surprised us by walking us all the way to the airport hotel and checking us in (I think this was a business class perk). Amazing service. My only complaint concerned drinks. First, China Southern doesn't seem to understand the idea of a drink before a meal. It took a lot of asking and still we usually ended up with the drink arriving when the meal was placed on our tray. Second, beers were always warm (I gave up on beer), and white wine often warm. Although we were able to get drink refills (sometimes even cool wine), I guess China Southern doesn't really understand how/when to serve alcohol drinks. I can't imagine it being better back in Economy. Still, not enough of an issue to down rate the airline.

2017-02-10,"""no snack service between meals""",2,"✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Guangzhou return via Wuhan. None of the cabin crew spoke or understood English very well. Ordering beverages were often accomplished with pointing and hand gestures as asking did not work. I was often handed the wrong item if I attempted to verbally ask. On our long 16+ hour flight, with a connection in Wuhan, there appeared to be no relief for the cabin crew. Due to the flight times, I tried to stay up the entire flight and saw the same faces the entire time. There was no crew change even with the stop in WUH. This lack of relief and long work hours may have explained the curt service provided. I truly felt sorry for the crew. Announcements were often made in Mandarin with a very brief broken English version afterwards. This often left us English speakers confused as to what was happening. After my friend's knee was rammed with the service cart, there was no immediate recognition by crew that something had occurred. Until we called her attention did she stop and look back, realizing the minor injury, then apologized. No snack service in between meals. There were no nuts, chips, cookies, fruits or sandwiches available in the galley in between meal service. We finally had a snack on the short leg between Wuhan to Guangzhou. The seats in economy were fairly tight and uncomfortable. The aircraft wasn't that old but the seats were well worn. I could feel the padding had worn out, leaving me sitting on what felt like metal bars underneath. The aisles were very narrow, often leading to bumped arms and legs from either crew or passengers walking by. The meals, for the most part, were edible and served warm . Unlike other airlines, they do not offer a printed menu, so I had no idea what some of the items were, even after eating it. The passenger next to me was vegetarian but either didn't pre-order the meal or it wasn't available to him. He didn't eat the entire 16+ hour flight as no alternatives were offered to him. Dealing with staff on ticketing issues is very difficult. The agents answering phones often had thick accents and had a hard time understanding me. The emails received were also fairly broken and hard to understand. When one calls during daylight hours in the US, calls are forwarded to China where they have an overnight crew. Once business hours end in the US, you have to call long distance to China. However, they have more staff to assist you then. If it wasn't for the low airfare offered, I would fly with Cathay Pacific or Singapore for similar routes. After this flight, I don't think I can recommend this to anyone or fly with them again. Even legacy US carriers offer something better than what I experienced here.",Economy Class,1,1,1,2,2,no,970,Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,SFO to CAN via WUH,November 2016,2,,China Southern Airlines,China

The delay meant once I arrived in Guangzhou I had missed my onward flight to Sydney. China Southern then placed me in a hotel (of my choice) for 24 hours with full courtesy bus three meals and a fantastic five star hotel. An unexpected stay over but one that I enjoyed. 24 hours later I was on my way to Sydney. Return journey I flew Sydney to Shenzen and this was a nightmare in the airport. From Shenzen onto Beijing and then onwards to Amsterdam. The airline on all journeys was superb, the long haul two meals and plenty of drinks and snacks in between, the short internal legs again a decent chinese meal and plenty of drinks.

2017-02-24,"""had a very good sleep""",8,"✅ Verified Review |  New York JFK to Guangzhou, seat 11A, the discounted flight tickets for business class was reasonable. I arrived at T4 JFK, two hours before taking off time, check-in was very quick, there were not many people waiting in the line of First / Business Class. Security check also had the separate line for First / Business Class. I rested at the lounge and boarding was on time. The business class was not full, otherwise, I would feel pressure when it is crowded. Welcome drink of Champaign was served. Food and Drink menu was delivered, and cabin crew helped me to order to lobster and lamb. Push back and taking off ahead of schedule. Soon after taking off, tea was served, followed by the food and drink. During this flight (which does not usually happen), cabin crew introduced wine and cheese to business class passengers. Normally, in my past experience, cabin crew would only ask whether you like red wine or white wine, whether you like ice cream or cheese. In this flight almost 50% in the business class were foreigners, and seemed to enjoy the wine and cheese. Soon after the meal time, the cabin crew helped to close window shades and cabin lights turned down. I had a very good sleep and woke up around 4 hours before landing time. I did not take the snacks and watched a movie and the flight finally landed at Guangzhou after 16 hours flight.",Business Class,4,5,4,3,5,yes,986,Boeing 777-300ER,Business,New York to Guangzhou,February 2017,3,,China Southern Airlines,China
2017-02-24,"""worst experience ever""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Wenzhou to New York via Guangzhou. My review is based on airline's last minute cancellation and rebook experience. The agent was rude and unprofessional. I was in the airport trying to work with China Southern Airlines agent to rebook my ticket and understand why they refuse to rebook my flight. According to their policy, even though they can see you in their system and I have an eTicket on hand, and holding a passport to verify, they still won't rebook because my passport info is not pre-entered in their system. I don't understand the logic, so asked if there's another way to resolve the issue, since I booked through online and it's 5am USA time and I may not be able to contact the travel agent. The China Southern Airline agent started to scream at me saying 'I already told you this! This is our policy, it's not China Southern Airlines fault that we can't help you!' I asked him to calm down.  After our initial conversation, he refused to speak to me again, but all I wanted is to work out a solution. Later on I was able to contact my online travel agent, had them manually enter my passport info. My travel agent was trying to re-book via online, but the airline didn't even disclose why the flight was cancelled so they couldn't help me. So I had to go back to the China Southern Airlines agent, he again said the name is not entered correctly and demand me to call my travel agent again. The fact is he didn't know how to read the name properly. In western culture, we put first name first, then last. In eastern culture, it's the opposite. He didn't apologize or anything. I asked to be booked at the earliest flight back to the States. He end up giving me 9+hrs layover. I later found out there was an earlier flight, which only has 3+hrs layover. I asked them to change the flight, but they refuse to do so, and there was no compensation for all the headaches caused. It could of been a much smoother process. I travel often, unfortunately this was the worst experience ever.",Economy Class,,,,,1,no,987,,Solo Leisure,Wenzhou to New York via Guangzhou,February 2017,1,,China Southern Airlines,China

Sent to wait 30 mins at another check-in line, had to navigate through throngs of people to get there. The Air France lounge there was a disgrace.  One line to board the aircraft and no priority boarding. At Guangzhou, the agent looked at my ticket and sent me to the non-business class line for immigration, but luckily I caught it.

When you get to the airport there was a wheelchair at every gate and I was taken wherever I wanted to go. Just coming back at Heathrow is the only pain and that's Heathrow not China Southern.

When boarding came it was from a bus lounge, and we just missed one. Staff were very polite and asked us to take a seat whilst waiting and after a short time we were boarded. The flight itself was very smooth and uneventful. Meal selection was simple without being basic, and surprisingly tasty! Cabin crew were very nice and nothing was too much trouble. Even announcements in English were clear and correct, which can be very hit and miss in Asia generally. I did not use the inflight entertainment, though a movie was playing on the drop-down screens. One suggestion to China Southern and perhaps it is regulated by CAAC and not the airline, but please review the need to power off mobile devices inflight. Most carriers and science now support the use of mobile devices in flight mode. Increasingly this is how passengers pass the flight, whether it is music, ebooks or games.

The food was great and they are quick to bring you any beverage you need at any point in your stay. They had a huge selection of movies, a wide variety of shows available, music, short travel movies, the map was great, every seat had a charging station so that was great as well. On the flight home my friend asked for a snack after the last meal and they gave her a turkey sandwich. I also asked for a glass of wine and even though they were technically done with opening new bottles she found me some red wine and was able to pour us each a glass which helped go back to sleep for the rest of the flight. I'm extremely Lactose in tolerant and I was able to eat most of the meals. The layover in Guangzhou is what puts them over the top. I only speak English and didn't know a drop of Chinese. Upon exiting the plane the crew direct you where to go for your visa and a woman from China Southern who is fluent in English was waiting to help us, she made sure we filled out the paper work then gave us a map and went through the rest of the directions with us & ensured we understood completely what to do/where to go. My friend and I followed other people and got lost in the airport for 1-2 hours and once we found the paper she gave us we found our next stop within 5 minutes.  Since we had a 26 hour layover the people at the China Southern counter had us pick a 5 star hotel. Since we were about to miss our bus the girls ran all the way through the airport with us, sat us on the first seats of the bus and talked to the bus driver and made sure he knew where to take us and made sure he told us when to get off. When our stop came up he found us and made sure we got off and told us where to go to find the concierge at the hotel. It was in the middle of the city and gorgeous.

Once I am in Guangzhou I have a long layover before I continue to Chiangmai. The airline provides a 4 star hotel due to the long layover (average 12 hours). Once I am at the transit desk in the airport the airline takes care of everything. The airline transport you to and from the hotel. Included is a free buffet breakfast in the hotel. The cost of my ticket tends to be several hundred dollars cheaper than my other options. Long layovers are not for everyone.

I got a superior seat by using member points and enjoyed the first class ground and air service with reasonable price. Comparing the Boeing 777-300 and the A380 models in China Southern, I think the facility isn’t enough to protect guests’ privacy here. There is not much advantage except the first class is more comfortable than the business class. This time, stewards did not hastily distribute meals for us as usual, instead told us provide meals at any time. The pajamas on the plane is very comfortable, I can see the smile of the flight attendants.

The self-check-in machine in Guangzhou Airport was very simple to operate which really saved lots of my time.

The crew remained available without being intrusive and the briefest movement was met by service and care. Customer interaction was prioritised at all times. From the traveller sleeping on his remote whose screen was turned off without a frown or comment at least 7 times via multiple customers moving at the same time during shifted crew meals being met with immediate abandonment of own meals to face customers and friendly check ups on awake customer.

One of the important thing was the flight has free wifi. By inputting your seat number, and last four figure of your passport, it was easily linked to the internet.

We were taken thru immigration and yelled at because we didn't have a visa (not surprising as we didn't intend to enter China as only transit). We then had to collect our luggage, which we were rather surprised to see, as it was consigned thru to Auckland from Rome. Then had to run following a staff member who didn't speak English from building to building at the airport dragging our cases - no mean feat when you are seniors with heart problems.

I needed to fly one-way from Singapore to Shanghai on a trip to visit family staying in more rural China. China Southern was less than half the price of a direct flight to Pudong, plus it landed at Shanghai Hongqiao (a fantastic airport) which connects to the railway station, saving me a 2 hour metro trip across Shanghai. After reading horror stories about China Southern and transiting in Guangzhou, I still decided it was worth it and booked. I am so happy I did. Check-in was as smooth as any airline I've ever flown. Boarding in Singapore was definitely more Chinese than American - I was one of 3 non-Asian people on a sold out flight, so most announcements were in Chinese. Boarding groups were ignored and I followed the crowd and just lined up when everyone else did, but otherwise boarding was very quick. The plane out was a dated A320, but the seats were much wider than what I have flown on recently. As it was an early morning flight, I passed out pretty hard, and awoke four hours later in Guangzhou. A quick note on transiting in Guangzhou to a domestic flight - do it! Passport control, customs, and security were a breeze. Bags are now checked through, so there is no need to collect and re-collect your flight (same for international) plus, if you are going to the domestic terminal, they put you on a small shuttle and drive you over via an indoor bridge. I was off the plane and to my new gate in about 30 minutes. The airport was lovely, and has everything a western one does, including the obligatory Starbucks. 2 hours is more than enough time for a layover, thought three will let you get lunch. My 2nd flight was delayed due to mechanical problems with the B777 we were to fly on. The gate was moved, which was made clear on the electronic reader boards at the gate. Again, announcements were all in Chinese and boarding was more of a get-in-line-first affair, but again it was quick, seats on the A330 were wide, and the meal service (on a 2 hour domestic flight!) was excellent. The crew actually spoke better English than on the SIN-CAN leg. Service was polite and efficient, drinks and food were great, and there was even a bit of IFE on drop down screens. Landing and baggage claim in SHA were super easy, and I was out of the airport in under 20 mins. If you are looking for the ultimate in luxury or opposed to service aimed at Chinese travelers, this is not your airline, but if you are a little flexible and looking for value and good service I cannot recommend China Southern enough.

The lady at the corner put me on an earlier flight and gave me the boarding passes: the planned departure time for the first flight was posterior to departure time of my connecting flight boarding pass. I mentioned my doubts about it but she confirmed that it should be fine as these were just estimates. I arrived in Guangzhou 3 hours later than my second flight departure. The transfer desk told me that the next flight for Paris will be in 24 hours. How come China Southern airlines can't assess this kind of risk, and send me to Guangzhou when keeping me in Shanghai would have been the best solution? I would have missed these flights, but I could have taken the next one without having to waste 24 hours of my time in an hotel in Guangzhou.

Excellent wine selection and Taittinger champagne were served elegantly. I chose the central row seat in 2-2-2 configuration so that I need not climb over anyone to get out. The lie flat seat was comfortable.

At gate boarding time came and went without any sign of a plane, or indication that there was a problem. China Southern staff on gate could not speak English although Chinese passengers appeared equally frustrated with the information on offer. Long story short, a one hour late departure made for a very tight - and stressful, for my elderly companion - connection at Guangzhou, not helped by a very lengthy bus ride from the plane to the terminal, with no staff to assist navigation until close to the gate when we were 'found' by a search party who expressed annoyance regarding our tardy arrival! Yet another lengthy bus ride to the plane, where we sat for over an hour 'due to air traffic control'; who knows the truth when such statements are made? By chance allocated seats in the premium economy section so plenty of leg room, but no benefit otherwise, though seat not as comfortable as that offered in economy by Qatar (or Gulf) in the A330.

First CZ advised that they could not check through our luggage to Amsterdam and we must pick up the luggage in Chengdu and then recheck in for next flight. Annoying but there was nothing we could do. After waiting in the lounge in Guangzhou we were told that our flight was cancelled and that they would rebook us on the next flight. The next flight was about 2 hours later which only left 40 minutes connecting time including picking up and checking in our luggage which was insufficient. I had pointed out that there was seats available to Amsterdam via Beijing and so why not rebook us on this. They refused saying this was against company policy and that only if we missed the connection could they rebook us. They promised that there would be on arrival to Chengdu a person to meet us at the gate and guide us to get our baggage and bring us to the next flight. On arrival there was no person to guide us nor was there any screens showing as to the status of our connecting flight. After we picked up our luggage we determined that check for KLM flight was in International Terminal which was about 700 meters away from the domestic terminal where we were. We arrived at the International Terminal and the check in counter was closed. We found an attendant from KLM who was helpful and booked us to Amsterdam via Beijing and onto the flight I had originally asked CZ Guangzhou personnel to book us (CZ0345). We run back to the Domestic Terminal to catch the flight to Beijing. To keep the story short we managed to just catch the flight and on arrival Beijing we went to the business lounge for CZ and found out there was no shower facilities.

2017-06-08,"""disappointed in customer service""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Guangzhou to Jakarta. I have been living and working in China for 3 years flying with China Southern every week. My wife is Chinese and she has always booked the flights (over 100) using her Chinese China Southern credit card. The trip from Guangzhou to Jakarta was no different, it was booked in plenty of time using the same method along with several other flights. A week before the flight while travelling elsewhere, I called at the China Southern counter to collect the receipts for the group of flights that had been booked, the Jakarta flight being one of them. A day before the flight I received a missed call from an unknown number. Upon my arrival at Guangzhou airport at 7am I was told that my ticket had been suspended. After a long and complex phone call from the customer services counter to the head office, I either needed to re-book it or get a photo of my wife, holding her Chinese ID and the credit card in front of her face to head office so that they would reinstate my ticket because the transaction had been identified as ""high risk"". Needless to say at 7.30am with 5 minutes until the flight closed this was not possible. I ended up having to buy another ticket, one for the original flight was 7000RMB more expensive than my original flight which cost 1370 RMB. The only option was to buy a ticket for the afternoon flight at 2000 RMB more than my original ticket and get put onto the morning flight. This is what I had to do. China Southern refunded me the cheaper original ticket but would not reimburse me for the extra 2000RMB it cost for the new ticket. They refused to reinstate my ticket despite them having the money, me having a receipt for it, a China Southern Credit card being used, other flights booked at the same time using the same method flown a few days earlier, me Elite loyalty card status and this booking method being used for the last 3 years on well over 100 flights. I wrote numerous emails and eventually ended up speaking to a customer service guy who said they could not refund the more expensive ticket because I had used it! Policy was policy. I asked to speak to his boss and he refused to give me his number or pass me across. To say I am disappointed in their customer service is an understatement, they could not care less about customers.

When dinner was served by the time they reached me and my friends they only had one choice of meal and it was beef which could not be changed. When we finally received something else (after calling the main flight attendee), the taste was awful. The quality of food was extremely poor. When it came to beverages after around 2 hours of an 11 hour flight they ran out of beer and wine (not to say that there was no other alcohol available).

2017-06-15,"""uninspiring airline food""",2,"✅ Verified Review |  China Southern could be an okay airline in economy. Flew Chengdu to Amsterdam via Guangzhou. Helpful flight attendants, uninspiring airline food, 2 rounds of drinks (although timed in a manner that leaves you eating the food dry), video on demand with a mediocre movie selection. However, the explosive growth of air travel in China in general and at CZ's home base in Canton in particular made the journey a miserable experience. In short, every flight was delayed, without anyone explaining anything, and 5 out of 6 bags of our party (and many more of fellow pax) were sent somewhere else and/or were delayed. To illustrate the misery, let's just recount the transfer at Canton: STA 10 pm. Delayed first leg from Chengdu (40 minutes). Just 0.45 mins left to cross two terminals, go through customs, security, passport control, and the mandatory path through duty free, plus finding the gate. CZ had other plans. Since this very plane was earmarked for technical service that night, they didn't bother to offload the passengers at the terminal but instead went for the hangar right away, at the far end of the airport, almost full circling the airport once. Waiting for the bus (15 min). Riding the bus from hangar to far end of terminal 1 (20 min). Crossing Terminal 1 (10 min). Passing the bridge to Terminal 2 (5 min). Crossing Terminal 2 (10 min). Passing Customs, security and passport control (30 min). Walking along closed Duty Free. (5 min) Finding gate. Gate is downstairs, where the regionals are supposed to be boarded. Finding 5 intercontinental boarding lines crisscrossed through 5 regional prop airliner sized gate space. Last persons to arrive. 5 more missing. Waiting, calling out, waiting. Boarding a minibus for the last four of us. Driving at 25 kms/h across the tarmac, past hangars (again) until almost reaching one of the runways, turning right, along full length of cargo area. Full Stop. Finding airplane waiting in the dark at the very far end of the airport, next to the runway threshold. Boarding airplane. Settling in assigned seats. Passenger announcement.

2017-06-28,"""leaving us stranded in Hefei""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  My husband and I were flying from Hefei to New York JFK via Guangzhou on China Southern Airlines on June 25. Two days earlier China Southern Airlines sent us a notification through Expedia that the first leg of the flight (Hefei to Guangzhou) was changed to an earlier time: 7:35am instead of the original 10:40am. This would have given us a 10.5 hour wait in Guangzhou instead of the original 7.5 hour wait. When we arrived at the airport, we discovered that all China Southern flights from Hefei to Guangzhou for June 25 were canceled!! China Southern Airlines never informed us that our first flight was canceled, leaving me and my husband stranded at the airport at Hefei. What made it worse is that China Southern Airlines didn't have any representatives or an office at the Hefei Airport. We tried to contact China Southern Airlines on the phone, but none of their customer service phones were operating in English. A couple of our Chinese friends called their customer service in Chinese and were able to speak to an agent, however, the agent didn't find our tickets in the system. At the end we were able to get new tickets on China Eastern Airlines, and were able to get to Guangzhou, and used our original reservation from Guangzhou back home to New York. In Guangzhou they didn't give us any explanation about this situation. China Southern Airlines behavior of canceling our tickets without informing us, and leaving us stranded in Hefei with no way of contacting them and obtaining a way out of there, in my opinion, is fraudulent. I made the ticket reservations a few months before our flight via Expedia, and I attempted multiple times to reserve a vegetarian meal for myself. All of my attempts were unsuccessful.

His service really made our experience with China Southern much better. My only suggestions for improvement would be: Don't allow Economy passengers to use the bathroom in the Premium Economy section. There is a curtain there dividing the two sections. At times Premium passengers were waiting in line to use the bathroom and also behind the curtain so were Economy passengers so it became a little disorganized. If there is a curtain there, it seems the idea is to keep these sections divided? We were given a sandwich that was completely wet, inedible. Maybe the refrigeration of sandwiches needs to be reviewed. Overall, a pleasant experience. We frequently use China Southern to fly between Australia and Beijing. We are seeing improvements.

2017-07-06,"""put me off flying with them again""",3,"✅ Verified Review |  This covers Sydney to Beijing via Shenzhen and Beijing to Sydney via Guangzhou, on two separate return journeys. The first was in March 2017 and the second was outbound in June and return in July. I’ve flown China Southern a few times in the past and been happy, but these two trips were enough to put me off flying with them again if I can possibly avoid it. While most China Southern long-haul flights offer seat-back TVs in economy, this is not available on the Sydney to Shenzhen route. Chinese airlines ban the use of mobile phones, even in in-flight mode. So you can either hope your laptop has eight hours of battery life, or bring a book. International-to-domestic transfer in Shenzhen is shambolic. I’ve done similar transfers, with CZ and other airlines, in other Chinese airports, and it can be slightly chaotic, but Shenzhen is in a different league. After disembarking and going through passport control, passengers are vaguely pointed to a fenced-off area near baggage reclaim with a few chairs, no food and no water. We are told to stay there “for a while” – there is never any indication as to how long that “while” might be, or as to why we might be waiting. On the March flight, it was a little over an hour; on the June flight, it was a little over 90 minutes. Both times, this left me with no time to buy food or drinks in departures before my connecting flight. After the March flight, I found out that we were all made to wait there while Customs – out of sight of us – inspects our checked luggage before it can be transferred to our connecting flights. This was not explained by CZ or airport staff. Passengers for connecting flights are called forward one flight at a time, and are then given vague directions as to where to go next, for a security check before proceeding to departures. On both occasions, I had to translate for bewildered non-Chinese-speaking passengers as announcements (by an ill-tempered lady with a megaphone) were only made in Chinese. Domestic flights are woefully unreliable. While my Shenzhen to Beijing flights were both only an hour or two late, the Beijing-Guangzhou flights were extremely late: by eight hours in March and by six and a half hours in July. At no point until push-back could the FAs or ground staff tell us how long the delay might be. For the July flight, we boarded the plane three hours late, and then sat in the plane at the gate for three and a half hours. On both occasions we were told the delay was due to “weather”. Of course, what that means is that there is a storm, or a potential storm, on the narrow corridor that the military has opened up to commercial operations, and that it is impossible to fly around the storm without leaving that corridor. This makes it practically impossible for domestic airlines to run North to South routes to timetable during the stormy season between March and September. It seems that the only way to get around this is to fly directly from a foreign country East of China to your final destination in China: in future I will try to use Korean, Japanese and Filipino airlines to get to Beijing, or fly directly from Sydney to Shanghai on China Eastern and then make my connection to Beijing by train. It’s a shame. FAs are generally quite helpful, and seat pitch is excellent by economy-class standards. But flying on CZ with a connection to Northern China is totally impractical.",Economy Class,4,3,2,1,4,no,1116,A330 / A321,Business,Sydney to Beijing via Shenzhen,July 2017,2,,China Southern Airlines,China

Guanzhou to NYC was delayed three hours and we could only tell because the time kept changing on the screen. Finally, onboard, the captain would mention some kind of mechanical issue. Communications in general are terrible. Don't even bother trying to get hold of someone before you fly. Customer service is non-existent. No one could tell me why I could select a seat on one leg but not the other of the same trip. The seats were uncomfortable. There was no entertainment from Kuala Lumpur to Guangzhou. No personal screens at all. Headphones were terrible quality. The meals were edible but never good. The flight attendants did their job but most may as well have been robots.

I have flown China Southern many times before but my most recent experience has made me decide to never fly with this airline again. Flight delays are common place, with frequently no explanation or apology given by the airline. My most recent example of appalling service by China Southern concerns an incident where my flight from Shanghai to Guangzhou was delayed to the point where I missed my connecting flight to Christchurch. I then spent four hours in a queue attempting to re-book my flight only to be told that there were no seats available and to come back the next day. By this time it was 4:00am. and I had had no sleep. At 9:00am. I again waited in a queue for two hours but was told that only a first class seat was available on a flight the next day but they refused to give it to me and tried to book me on another airline without success. After some very forthright conversation they eventually agreed to do it, however, when I got on the flight it was an economy seat that I was given, and this flight was also delayed without explanation. When I finally arrived in New Zealand two days after my original scheduled arrival, I was dropped at Auckland at 2:00am. with no means for me to get to my actual destination of Christchurch 1,000kms away. All attempts to contact China Southern were in vain so I had no choice but to buy a ticket with another airline myself. And when I did eventually manage to contact someone from China Southern two days later, they offered no apology and refused to reimburse me for the extra ticket that I had had to buy. If you want to get to your destination on time,  want to be treated politely and with respect, and if you want an airline that will take responsibility for passengers who have been inconvenienced by flight delays or rescheduling then my advice is do not fly China Southern.",Economy Class,1,4,4,4,3,no,1121,,Couple Leisure,Shanghai to Auckland via Guangzhou,July 2017,1,,China Southern Airlines,China

The worst airline and customer service I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. On the day of my flight out of SFO, I could not check-in online or see the flight status. My flight to Guangzhou was delayed 4 hours and the airline did not bother to send any flight updates the morning of, even though they knew by 9am that my 2pm flight was going to be delayed. The check-in counter staff were unorganized. My boyfriend asked if we could be upgraded for free to premium economy and they wanted to charge an extra $400 for more leg room. Our 4 hour layover caused us to miss our connecting flight to Phuket in Guangzhou. We were promised by the SFO staff that we would receive a hotel voucher so we could get some rest before our 10pm flight out of China. We arrived in Guangzhou at 2am. No one at Guangzhou airport spoke English and there were only a handful of China Southern employees working that late. After running around the airport for over an hour trying to find customer service to receive our hotel voucher, we were ushered onto a bus at 3am and driven to an undisclosed location to the dirtiest hotel I’ve ever seen. The bus staff refused to tell us where they were taking us, even though it was a 45 minute drive from the airport. We, along with 5 other Americans in the same situation, demanded the bus driver return us to the airport after he refused to let us know when the next shuttle would return. After returning to the airport, I asked staff if it was possible for me to change my flight so I could fly into another city in Thailand and catch a different flight (on a different airline) to Phuket. Customer service told me no and said I was not allowed to make any changes to my flight. When I asked if I could just not board the plane and cancel my trip with them, I was also told no.

2017-07-30,"""waste customers' time""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Shanghai to New York JFK via Guangzhou. I believe bad reviews about their customer services. We chose it for our Asia trips this summer 5 flights in total, 1 flight (3 tickets) was wasted. We couldn't believe we would have run into so many troubles with their customer services. Things happen, that's why the customer services are there for. However, the customer services at China Southern Airline is there to drive you to mental house - like many previous reviews mentioned. When the flight was delayed, no announcement until 10 minutes before the boarding time, delayed for over 4 hours no water or food was provided until the majority customers demanded. We paid extra money to select our seats, but seats were given away. Wanted to change the outbound tickets (and paid for the changeable price), first was told “yes, you can change it”, but later was told we couldn’t because the previous customer services rep made a mistake. In any other airlines, this change would be granted if they said “Yes”, but not in China Southern. We told them we paid for a changeable price for the outbound flight, but they told us that we couldn't because our inbound tickets couldn't be changed despite we told them we don't need make any changes to the inbound tickets, they wouldn't listen, they insisted if we changed outbound tickets, the inbound tickets were changed automatically regardless inbound tickets are actually changed or not, so we asked them why they charged us for the changeable price for the outbound flights, they repeated with ""if you changed outbound tickets, the inbound tickets were changed automatically regardless inbound tickets are actually changed or not"", we thought we were talking to a broken recording machine! Promised responding time for the damaged luggage first was 3-5 business days, then extended to 7 business days, then the respond was they have been working on it, but no dates can be provided, asked who we could reach out to escalate the matter, they gave us a wrong number and extension, the guy on the other side of the line was clueless. When called back to the mainline again, the customer services told us that they don't know when they can get back to us, they are only responsible for taking in the complains and reading the status according to the records by the computer.  Most ironically, every time, they finished every phone call with ""is there anything else I can help you?"". They have no idea what customer service is - their mission is to waste customers' time and aggravate customers further!

I had problems putting in special meals (Vegetarian) request and seat selection. I called them up and requested them to confirm my seat selection and special meal request for family of four. Later I checked online and everything seemed fine. The seats worked out fine but on London to Guangzhou as well as Guangzhou to Sydney leg the steward said they had only one special meal request. We had to make do with some buns and tea. I I have travelled very frequently and even on lesser known airlines the stewards have concocted vegetarian meals on the go and serve me. But here they never came back to me. Also they were not very fluent in English. On one occasion the stewardess had to ask my fellow Chinese passenger to translate for prawns dish. I think the frequency of beverage services should be more. I had to go the galley frequently for my beverage, and many other passengers too were doing so.

Cynics might argue that's not saying much, but for anyone who has battled with the po-faced indifference of Air China, I would encourage you to give China Southern a try. The service was excellent and staff friendly, and English skills were generally good. On our inbound flight to Guangzhou, for travellers connecting to other flights, the airline supplied many staff to help negotiate the messy rabbit warren that is Guangzhou Baiyun Airport. On the return flight to Melbourne, the plane was delayed several hours by weather, and staff kept up a steady supply of drinks, food, and information to keep passengers satisfied. The only criticism I have, similar to some others, is what might diplomatically be called the ""adequate"" food. It was mostly fairly uninspiring meat-and-rice dices, although the Mediterranean style chicken (Western option) wasn't too bad. Perhaps an area they could improve a little. Otherwise, I was very satisfied with China Southern.

We missed both of our transfers back and forward because we had not correctly evaluated the needed time for the visa check.

I was stunned, that you can't allot seat together, the least I can expect my kids with me or may be with my parents.

We were told that first we were going to go to Seoul then on to San Francisco - numerous lies were told to us before we were loaded onto an ANA flight via Tokyo Narita. The night time station manager continually reassured us that our bag would be on whatever flight they got us on to SFO - but bag lost for 2 days.

The departure was slightly delayed due to late arrival of aircraft, but we managed to bring back the time, and I made it on time for my connection. Guangzhou to Shanghai leg was operated by a new Boeing 777-300ER, which the IFE was very big and responsive. However on my returning flight CZ3532 from Shanghai to Guangzhou, the aircraft changed last minute to an A330-300, but the it was a new aircraft and the cabin is almost the same as Boeing 777. The only thing that dissatisfies me is that China Southern Airlines has 4 flights a day to Singapore but operated by either A319 or A320 which is not that comfortable for a 3:50 flight, I would rather they operate using a wide body and with less frequency.",Economy Class,4,5,5,5,5,yes,1174,A320 / Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Singapore to Shanghai via Guangzhou,September 2017,5,,China Southern Airlines,China

Its ground staff was there to take me through the airport to the lounge, the lounge staff were delightful and helped organise a paid upgrade for my connecting flight to Urumqi swiftly. The cabin crew on both outgoing and returning flight were excellent. Realising that I was too short to reach the overhead bins, they put my cabin luggage up and took it down without me even asking for an assistance and with a smile. Not many airlines do this and they let their customers struggle or ask some other customer for help with the cabin luggage. Well done, China Southern!

A simple and inexpensive process that was well worth the effort. It was a new aircraft with spacious cabin layout, mood lighting and windows where the glass darkened, no need for any blinds.  Excellent food and drinks, fantastic crew that made the trip a pleasure. I wish that China Southern used such new aircraft on its Sydney flights.

Having experienced economy in Chinese airports, with flights direct into Beijing and Shanghai, I dreaded an international to domestic change at the huge Guangzhou airport. But having heard business class passengers were escorted swung it for me. So paid the extra for business class, and regretted nothing. The seat was comfortable, food was good and well presented. All the attendants spoke good English too. The entertainment could be better I'd admit, but this has been well documented, so I was well prepared with a gapped book and music via my iPod. The escort through the airport was much appreciated as I doubt I could have navigated myself around as quickly. Would I recommend China Southern?

A330 was used for the second route, but it seemed a little bit old, fortunately the careful air attendant found out my specialty, she arranged a seat close to the window to me, meanwhile gave me a inflight travel kit.

Overall dissatisfactory experience on for the most part older aircraft with no touch screen and little legroom on the A330. Food on the long haul segment of the flight was relatively good, whilst English service was bad. Safety video is extremely old school. No English magazine on the long haul, then on the domestic flight they had one - bizarre! Changsha as a stopover was a disaster. Though checked luggage is forwarded, you have to leave the aircraft, go through immigration and landside security check, led by an employee who ""tries"" to lead the group. All this in a hurry to catch the same plane again. Back in the plane, one passenger seems to be missing. Stewardesses walk along the corridor 10 times (!) trying to count passengers with their manual counter (seems to be a China Southern thing - extremely annoying and unprofessional). NO info from crew or cockpit whatsoever (in English or Chinese) for 2 hours! After 2 hours water is served. Followed by take off shortly after. Also unnecessary long (roundabout) ways in Guangzhou Airport: while the plane lands at a domestic gate, a bus is provided for all travelers from Frankfurt, which brings you again to the international terminal, which is especially inconvenient when you have to catch a domestic onward flight. China Southern also disappoints by saving on drinks on domestic flights, meaning a bottle of water only!

I had an empty seat next to me, so used the spare duvet as a sort of mattress pad. Pretty comfortable and I got a good sleep. Breakfast was served 2 hours out - again main course was not great, but cereal, fruit, bread were all fine. Arrived early. In Guangzhou transit I was met by a China Southern host and guided through the process of getting a 24 hour visa. He then took me to the free transit hotel and ensured I was checked in. Second leg was much the same, A330 is older and the entertainment was a little clunkier. The French flight attendant in the business cabin was outstanding. Food was better than the first flight, but the main courses do need work. Arrived early at Paris. Overall China Southern have a really good Business product. They have 2 issues to address: firstly the ordering of drinks and meals before take off; and secondly the quality of main courses. On other flights with them, the quality has been great.

2017-10-14,"""definitely avoid China Southern""",3,"✅ Verified Review |  I booked my trip from Seoul to Copenhagen with China Southern (flying with them from Beijing and Amsterdam) and my own experience was far from great. I bought the ticket from China Southern, but I could not check in with them at Incheon Airport and had to go to Korean Air, since they operated the first leg. I could only get two boarding passes for the first 2 legs, and I could not select seats on leg 2 and 3. Other airlines have in the past checked me in all the way from the beginning. All the problems started in Beijing Airport. In order to transfer, I had to get a 72 hour transfer visa and then check in again, even though I had a boarding pass already. When I went to the check in counter, there were no staff there, even though it was 8pm. No one was helping and very few people spoke english. A line started to form, but still no staff. I ended up not being able to change my seat, due to no staff being present. Beijing Airport was terrible, old, dirty and nothing worked. The wifi was a joke, but I was happy when I finally boarded and saw a free wifi sticker next to my inflight entertainment system. I pulled out my iPhone and immediately a flight attendant appeared and told me to shut off my phone. It turned out that all mobile phones have to be shut off during the whole flight. Adding to the general theme of nothing making sense, there was a sticker right next to the free wifi sticker, saying no mobile phones allowed. So you can only use wifi on a tablet. Either way, the wifi didn't even work so you couldn't really do that either. The passengers were mostly Chinese. A fight almost broke out in the queue to the plane, and people were loud throughout most of the flight. In the morning, breakfast was served - I received the saddest omelette with some sort of white sausage next to it. The purser of the plane was friendly though - I had a conversation with her and she seemed really nice. The legroom was not bad for someone who's very tall like me. But the rest of staff, food, and nonsense Chinese rule about switching off your phone, and the experience at the Beijing Airport made me wish I hadn't picked China Southern.

Great customer service when we arrived at China Southern Airline check-in counter at Shenzhen airport: upon realizing we are traveling with 2 kids and grandparents, the staff offered to help try to get us to sit together in the front row of the cabin which is a lot more child friendly. The staff were proactive in helping us to board to plane and to sit down, fold up the pram etc and made our lives a lot easier. During the flight, upon checking with a lot of the passengers including us, first inflight movie was Car Stories, the kids loved it. It was a flight packed with kids because it's end of school holiday in Australia and the crew's understanding and choice of movie was excellent and spot on.

2017-10-19,"""rude male ground staff""",2,"✅ Verified Review |  Guangzhou to Manila. I am addressing this complaint to a rude male ground staff posted at the entrance of all the check-in counters F and G of China Southern Airlines today in Guangzhou airport. He asked for our e-ticket and was saying something about the long line at the checkin counter and that we go away, check if we have our boarding pass and gesturing for us to move aside and go. I have no idea what he was talking about, so I asked him again and then he kept gesturing and saying over there over there computer! I told him to just tell me where exactly because you keep saying over there, where is over there? While i am speaking to him, he suddenly acted as if he cannot hear and see me. I kept repeating my question but he did not respond and continued on with this behavior. So after asking around we found out that we need to verify using our passports if our boarding pass is already available for printing from a self service machine so that we can queue on the checkin counters with the shorter line. At the self service machine there was only 1 staff assisting, compared to the many passengers trying to figure out how to use them. To China Southern Airlines, next time put someone who is competent and can communicate well and who is not rude at the entrance of your checkin counters! We dont need to be treated this way.  You also have non-chinese speaking passengers!

I was in premium economy supposedly, which seemed to mean more legroom but the same food as in economy. Entertainment system very limited, and the USB charging did not work. Furthermore, Chinese airlines cannot allow you to use your phone, even in flight mode, which is ridiculous in this day and age. Cabin crew are cold, even robotic, rarely, if ever, smile. Their English is poor to fair, announcements were hard to understand generally. They serve wine in minute proportions, and I was refused a third glass (on an 11 hour flight!) on the assumption that I would be 'drunk'! Again, staff quite rude and never experienced before, as I certainly was not drunk but wanted a sleeping aid. Seat was of moderate to okay comfort for economy. Flight attendants refused to assist with my seat neighbour, who was being rude and refusing to move to let me go to the bathroom, saying it 'was not against regulations'. The domestic leg was much better, friendlier crew and better (and more copious) food.

The plane is pretty new, with 1.5 year age. 3-3-3 seats for the economy cabin on this 777, roomy for width and leg space. Due to the off-peak period and the relatively off-peak city of Wuhan the flight is only 1/3 full, which means I can enjoy all 3 seats and make them a very comfortable bed. The crew are fantastic. When you are asleep, they will use a post-it to remind you calling for food/service after waking up. Complementary eye-mask and ear-plug for economy passengers on request. Back galley space is opened for passengers for stretching/walking, much better than US airlines, especially for long flights. Variety of food and drink choices. The spicy sauce is also available.

Flight attendants were attentive and kept everyone happy. Water was offered throughout the flight without having to leave my seat to go to the galley. The Boeing 787 layout 3-3-3 configuration is uncomfortable, noticeably less seat width which is was bad considering an 11+ hour flight. Ground staff at Guangzhou were not helpful with damage control, there was a delay for the Bangkok flight which was scheduled to depart at 20:15, the time was constantly being pushed further and further forward. We were then told the flight was cancelled and that accommodation would be offered to then take us in the morning - then told it was running again! During this time ground staff only communicated with Chinese speaking passengers! When trying to communicate with ground staff in English they looked at you confused and disorientated. Disappointing for a massive global hub to be so disorganised with poor English skills. This was the only issue with my journey - return leg was excellent and all flights departed on time.

2017-11-08,"""you'll need a Chinese visa""",1,"✅ Verified Review |  Wow, by far the worst customer service I've ever had. Our flight was booked from Melbourne to Amsterdam via Shenzhen and Beijing and return from Amsterdam to Melbourne via Beijing and Guangzhou. We each thrice checked for visa requirements and were both under the impression that China has a 24-hr transit visa. Wrong! Some cities/airlines do not apply to this. We were taken to the service desk and waited for an hour before they told us our best options were cancel & rebook new flights, or call the airline to find a way around the cities that needed visas, or risk it for the biscuit. We nearly risked it but decided to do our 1st option (despite the prices, it was a safer bet)! So onto asking for a cancellation and refund request. The website was outdated stating that website works were underway (however the dates had passed already), difficult to maneuver as some sections were in Chinese, and when I attempted to apply for a refund, it sent me to a 404 error page. Previous to that, no confirmation emails/texts had been sent to my email address/mobile despite the multiple requests.  We called the airline line, was on hold for hours (as you might've anticipated) and then were told to call the office in Australia (which was closed due to the public holiday) and that they couldn't help us. After insisting, they told us to send an email with details of our trip and our passports and to call back when we received a response email regarding our cancellation/refund, which shouldn't take longer than 10-15 minutes. Email sent. 20 minutes passed. No email. So we call back, wait for another half hour and (of course) speak to a different agent. This agent says very abruptly ""There's a 30-minute processing time from when we receive your email. Call back when you get it. Bye."" And she hangs up before we get a chance to respond with anything. It's been over an hour and 15 minutes now and we still haven't received an email. Bottom line: Don't fly with this airline if you're a foreigner and don't have any intention of going to China. Their tickets might seem cheap if you're transiting through the country, but unless you have a Chinese passport, prepare yourself for tagteaming and chasing customer service. If you do travel with this airline, check all connecting airports to ensure they qualify under the 24-hr transit permit, and if not, then you'll need a Chinese visa which takes >3-4 weeks to process. If you book through a travel agent, it is their job to tell you if you need a visa.",Economy Class,1,,,,1,no,1228,,Couple Leisure,Melbourne to Amsterdam via Shenzhen / Beijing,November 2017,1,,China Southern Airlines,China

2017-11-13,"""limited English wasn’t so fortunate""",3,"✅ Verified Review |  Beijing to Amsterdam return. It was a mixed experience, flying with China Southern. There were good and bad things and I’ll start with the bad: On the outgoing leg of my flight, I left my rather expensive noise cancelling headphones under my seat as I exited the plane. I was seated all the way in the back of the plane (in economy) and I was one of the last passengers to leave the aircraft. An hour after disembarking I realized my mistake and immediately contacted the staff in Amsterdam airport. They told me to file a report with the lost and found office, which I immediately did. A week later, nothing had turned up. I called the lost and found office to double check, but there was nothing. I called China Southern but nobody picked up so I emailed them instead, with no result. So how is it possible that a pair of $400 headphones can disappear like that? Since I have no proof, I cannot say that a certain group of people stole my headphones, but I do find it very very suspicious that an expensive item like that can simply vanish from the plane. The worst part is how China Southern handled the episode. I emailed them, describing my experience, only to receive a standard copy and paste response, saying that nobody would ever steal from a plane. All my following replies to the email were just ignored. No response at all. The return leg of the flight was better, but that was mostly because the staff in Amsterdam bumped me to premium economy, which is a lot nicer than economy. I can’t say if it’s worth the money, since I didn’t pay for the upgrade, but I will say that it was a very nice experience. The seats were bigger with more leg room, way more comfortable than economy and even the toilets were more spacious. The crew were mostly friendly and nice, but their limited English wasn’t so fortunate. I had a headache and asked slowly and clearly for an aspirin, which was understood as ice cream by two different flight attendants. I then told them I had pain in my head and pointed at my forehead, after which they brought me a small free toiletry bag. When I finally found someone who was able to understand me, I was told that they didn’t have any aspirins, because it was a serious drug. Somehow this isn’t a problem with other airlines, though. China Southern had free wifi available on the return leg of the flight, which is a great bonus, but in reality it was extremely slow and on top of that it was the Chinese version of the internet with no access to google, gmail, youtube, facebook, instagram or any of the sites that westerners use. So all in all, a mixed bag. The flight experience was pretty standard in economy and pretty great in premium economy. But my expensive headphones that simply vanished on the plane, and the complete lack of any kind of assistance from China Southern, left me bitter and I will look elsewhere next time I book a flight.",Premium Economy,4,1,2,3,3,no,1231,A330,Solo Leisure,Amsterdam to Beijing,November 2017,4,1,China Southern Airlines,China

I have flown this route a lot but this review is specifically to compliment the airline about the excellent service on 15 November on CZ304 (the night flight from London). China Southern in general does a great job with in-flight service and the quality of seating in business/first; where it falls short and needs a lot of work is in the ground service/transfer service in Guangzhou (which it advertises as excellent but in practice is highly deficient). The crew on CZ304 did a particularly good job and worked very hard during the flight, even by what I regard as very high standards of China Southern. I heard other passengers leave the flight complimenting the crew. Unfortunately China Southern ruins the experience of passengers with the poor way its staff handle transfers at Guangzhou airport — it’s always someone else’s problem and when there are problems, the staff seem always to be missing on the ground. But this review is of the flight itself and I don’t think of the more than 100 flights I have done in the past year or 100 or so China Southern flights in the past few years that there has been a better in-air experience.",Business Class,5,5,4,4,5,yes,1249,Boeing 787-8,Business,London to Guangzhou,November 2017,3,,China Southern Airlines,China

Flights were on time and went without any hitches but there is a major problem with this airline, being the smallest seat pitch I have encountered even on a domestic flight let alone a long haul 12 hour flight. Even some of our taller oriental friends were struggling with it. I was fortunate to be able to move to a seat with a vacant seat adjacent and thanks to a kind person at the check-in desk at Heathrow I had a bulkhead seat on my return flight. Unless you are of below average stature I wouldn't recommend this airline, profit comes ahead of customer comfort. The flight attendants were also a bit slap-dash with the service. Coffee was pre-mixed with sugar and milk whether you like it or not, presumably to save the flight attendants a bit of time and effort. Wi-Fi is available at Guangzhou airport if you know that you have to scan your passport at a machine to get a ticket with a password, but for non techno-savvy people, it would be hard to figure out.

While only a stop in Guangzhou or only a stop in Beijing allow for visa-free 'in transit' stops you will have to apply for a visa if hitting both stops even if you never leave airport. Unfortunately with the unexpected, unwanted stop (as airline put it ""just a little stop"") the time wasted for the visa process made us all miss the continued flight, on same plane, same seat, to Beijing. I would never have bought this ticket knowing in advance about the stop and consequences. The airline re-booked me in less than 4 hrs while killing time at airport.

The pursers were kind and offered to chat with passengers during the flight. The food selection is quite wide, with some Chinese specialities. Most of them taste quite good, like the signature Beef Noodle Soup.

The entertainment system is good, with good selection of movies. The wifi is excellent, free and fast!  The amenity kit is very bad, CZ has not changed it for years and it is a real shame considering most other Chinese airlines now offer much more upscale products and bags, and even pyjama (Hainan Airlines). The screen of the entertainment system is quite small.

2017-12-29,"""cabin crew were outstanding""",8,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to London via Guangzhou. In terms of a low cost option for long-haul flights, I've been pleased with this airline overall. I preferred the A330 aircraft on the Melbourne to Guangzhou leg, which seemed to have a bit more legroom and felt less cramped than the Boeing 787 on the Guangzhou to London leg. One of the main problems on the 787 is that the buttons to operate the overhead lights and for example, the volume of the in-flight entertainment are embedded into the end of the armrest. It may be because I am a biggish guy, but I inadvertently switched on the lights and manipulated the entertainment system of the poor girl sitting next to me a few times! The only way to avoid this was to draw my arms close to my body and avoid touching her armrest altogether. Which made things a bit cramped for me. The A330 has a better solution, with all controls contained via the touchscreen on the newer entertainment consoles. The other bugbear is that the use of one's mobile phone is prohibited on this airline -  I understand that this is the policy of China and the airline must tow the line here. Otherwise, there are plenty of pluses. The fares are budget friendly, but it did not feel like a budget experience. The cabin crew were outstanding - always attentive, polite, keeping the plane tidy and providing constant, smiling service. Certainly one of the best experiences I've had with airline staff. The food was also pretty good, when one adjusts their expectations to airline cuisine and does not expect unrealistic, restaurant quality in economy class. It was tasty, nutritious and plentiful enough. Also, the in-flight entertainment provided more than enough options for me in my native language. I watched four good quality films that helped me to pass the time pleasantly. The ads before each film are slightly annoying, but are easily skipped. Overall, would I recommend?

I took a flight from Christchurch to Guangzhou on 22nd December and had a connecting flight to Dubai on 23rd December. Due to the terrible weather conditions in Dubai, the flight was diverted to Muscat. Weather conditions are not something airlines can control. What was astonishing was their lack of customer service. They threw us in an airport and then did not even reach out to us with an update for 12 hours. They then took us to Sharjah, because they did not land the flight in Dubai at the allotted time. All passengers disembarked at Sharjah and zero attention was given to transit passengers (with no UAE Visa and hence no way to leave the airport). The airport manager at Sharjah had to speak to the staff at China Southern, and we basically had to hoard the captain from the previous flight in order to get them to arrange for someone to get us. 6 hours later, they fly us to Dubai (with our luggage still in Sharjah). Now came the icing on the cake. They were completely reluctant and unwilling to arrange us flights to our final destinations despite us continuously begging them to do so, their excuse being ""We are doing it"". We met the most rude China Airlines staff there too. 8 hours into waiting, I had it and bought myself a new Emirates ticket out of Dubai. I haven't received replies on my emails for refund on my ticket from Dubai to Kuwait. This experience was an absolute horror, and one I will never forget.

On my flight back, as scheduled, I had a 1 hour stop over in Hangzhou. During this stop over I had to go through customs and collect my luggage. After running to check in, China Southern informed me I was too late and needed to check in 45 minutes before. It is in no way possible to get out of the plane, go through customs, security, collect your luggage then check in within 15 minutes let alone an hour.

Due to their airport policy, I was required to collect my checked in baggage and then check in as usual, despite being a transfer passenger (I did not get any priority from China Southern airline, even though they knew I had a short time to do my transfer to connect to my next flight). In the end, I did not have enough time to complete check-in and missed my flight. I had to do customs immigration after arriving, then waited again for my baggage to be collected - again, I was given no help or priority, despite showing my ticket to China Southern representatives while waiting in line for immigration and while waiting at the baggage claim for my bags. They did not help me get to the connecting flight, even after I flagged a few representatives at the airport ahead of time. China Southern airlines (who made the schedule), did not admit fault and in the end, I had to pay them more to change my later flight (as I was not going to be able to catch my original connecting flights).

The food provided was well served and the crew members were very considerable and helpful. They made sure that my violin case was placed safely and took it out for me in advance when I'm leaving the aircraft. They provided a pouch that contains a eye blinder, earplugs, small toothbrush and toothpaste for each customer. However, there was no wifi connection available in the cabin, which may cause some inconveniences to some customers. The second one, which I think is particular to CSA, is that I had to check my luggage again in JFK since I am transferring to CLE afterwards.

I checked in on their APP so I don't need to rush to the airport. I got one piece of luggage checked in and walked around the new terminal. It was huge, convenient and beautiful. As they adopted self-boarding at Terminal 2, I got the chance to experience this. I just needed to put my boarding pass with the bar code on the machine to be scanned and it took about 2 seconds to let me through. The seat was more spacious compared with their Boeing 777-300, and that was why I chose this flight with A330. I fell into sleep after take-off soon and the whole flight was steady.

The air hostesses were very caring and service oriented. They walked down the aisle almost every hour with water and other beverages asking anyone awake if they wanted something to drink. The were smiling and seemed to be  enjoying their jobs.  The thing they need to work on is their ground presence. They need to have their staff available for assistance inside security at LAX at least 3 hours before boarding. For passengers connecting at LAX, it was very worrisome to not find any signs of China Southern Airlines at all inside the connecting area. No one even seemed to know which gate they operated from. Even the airport information staff seemed to have no idea that this airlines even operated from LAX. When their staff finally arrived after gate announcement, it was chaotic as too many people needed assistance and the lines were very long. When I finally saw an agent, it was too late. They said they did not have enough time to locate and re-tag my luggage to final destination.

Airport in Guangzhou is well functioning and quick to pass or transit in. Good lounges in Dubai and Guangzhou. The 2nd leg only deserves 6/10 despite the FAs were faultless.

The kids' meals are not so attractive so my kids are not interested in the food, the service staff would try to find some snacks to make the kids happy.

2018-06-25,"""I had not informed myself""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review relates to a booking I made for December 2018. I would warn transit passengers who travel to a destination country other than China to book connections with China Southern that include flights CZ332 (Frankfurt - Guangzhou) or CZ331 (Guangzhou - Frankfurt). Both flights have a so-called ""technical stopover"" in Changsha, which lasts less than 90 minutes and during which the transit visa process has to be completed at the airport. In case of delays of the incoming flight or during the transit process, there is a high risk of missing the onward flight to Guangzhou (or the subsequent onward flight to the destination country), as due to having two landings in China, travellers receive only a 24-hour transit visa instead of the usual 72-hour transit visa, which then may no longer be sufficient to successfully continue the journey to the desired destination. Unfortunately, I had not informed myself enough before and made the mistake to book such a flight.

It was a short flight of 1h50m but they served food and drink in an efficient manner. One complaint I have is that they wouldn't serve a second round of beverage unless you ask. And one tiny cup of water is definitely not enough for the flight. I understand that they're saving budget, but one more round of beverage would be great.

Ground staff at Phnom Pehn sent our details ahead of our departure, so staff met us at Shenzhen and guided us through the process of obtaining a visa, getting it approved, where to then check in and even the gate we needed to then depart from. The staff spoke English, and were even able to go back and grab a bag that had been left before we went through immigration. Special mention to a staff who was friendly and helpful, and made sure we had comfortable seats on the last leg. All my dietary requirements were also met (which doesn't always happen).

The onboard WiFi never worked on any leg of my trip, and the productivity suite of lights and power outlets were useable, but clunky and difficult to operate. The food and service, like at the lounges, was satisfactory, and they staged the different courses of the food (a complaint other users have had about CSA’s food service in the past has been addressed: they used to bring everything out and not clear plates). This never happened to me. Flights were  late for every departure. A refreshing surprise was they humidified the cabin so the air wasn’t as dry as it could have been on other planes. I would use CSA again, but would avoid Chinese airports IF at all possible. The security staff were so rude it was comedic, and unlike other Asian airplane hubs, like in Japan and Korea, no smoking is allowed anywhere (and the security staff confiscated my Zippo lighter).

Because I am a Dutch citizen, I was not able to do the on-line check-in in China, so I needed to queue at the manual check-in desk.  I had a transfer flight from Shanghai to Amsterdam via Guangzhou, but because the tickets were booked via company agency, and the previous flight routes I have gave up the 2nd route due to personal reason, so I had some trouble checking-in the 3rd & 4th routes. In the flight ticket it didn't show as a transfer flight, so I was worry about if my luggage would be right delivered to the final destination Amsterdam or not. The check-in desk staff helped me confirm the luggage will not be withdrawn in the transfer location, and prepared a red tag regards to the final destination delivery signed by me and attached it on the luggage. For long journey flight, I prefer to sit by the aisle. The staff highlighted the seat on the boarding pass and confirmed to me that I got seat as I wished. he pointed out the boarding gate, explained me the route and wished me a pleasant journey.

They allowed me to send this hugely oversized luggage the whole way to Khartoum – they needed 2-3 guys to fit them in as we travel on small aircraft. China Southern check-in staff overruled those rigid guys working in Noi Bai Airport services checking in odd-sized luggage. They use the Sky Team-lounge in Hanoi which is good but provisions cannot at all match the glamorous design and interior facing the runways. Still no champagne, less brands of beer, food offerings are shrinking and wines offered are sub-par. No fresh coffee and fruits display only contains the cheapest of the cheapest fruits: watermelon, papaya, guava, etc. Neither pineapple, mango, jackfruits, nor durian. Very stingy. Flights well announced on media, arrived and departure punctually. Outstanding airline as compared to most other China mainland carriers. Onboard, very sparse offering, but caring FAs. Had 6 seats in a 2 rows 1-2 configuration by myself. They only loaded 1 business class meal. No alcohol onboard except they load 4 beers/pax in business class.

2018-08-24,"""it was a fine experience""",7,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew with a friend of mine from Amsterdam to Seoul via Beijing. The price was quite fair. Flight departed half an hour late, landed on time. The interior of the A380 seemed a bit dated.  When you're flying with 2 persons, the upperdeck is ideal. Seat configuration upstairs is 2-4-2 , and on the 2-rows there is an extra compartment storage on the window side. Seat reservation is much much cheaper than a seat reservation when you're flying a low-cost airline. The cabin staff was kind, slightly rushed and their English was minimal. Meals tasted okay and the quantity was fine. After the arrival at Beijing we disembarked at T2. This terminal is small and convenient compared to the larger T1. After disembarkation, ground staff was awaiting transfer passengers at the gate. This group of passengers were guided to a private security check , without any other travelers. Our transfer time was less than 2 hours and we made it perfectly. The A321 interior was again dated. The English spoken by the crew was again the bare minimum. But a hot meal was complimentarily served on just a 2 hours flight. Overall it was a fine experience, no fuss at all during the transfer at the chaotic Beijing airport but most importantly: The value for your money is almost unparalleled!",Economy Class,3,3,3,3,5,yes,1547,A380-800 / A321-200,Couple Leisure,Amsterdam to Seoul via Beijing,August 2018,4,,China Southern Airlines,China

2018-09-17,"""Overall a good airline""",8,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Tianjin via Guangzhou. The meals on these particular routes were Chinese in style; my travel companion, who rarely eats airplane food, called the meals delicious and I found the meals quite suited to a Chinese palate. The passengers on both the departure and return flight were very demanding. Despite this, the stewardesses were quick and patient in their services, providing blankets, headphones, and pillows during boarding. China Southern and Xiamen boarded their flights in an orderly fashion and organized their queues in such a way as to prevent passengers from later zones from sneaking into the front. Passengers who did so were told to line up in their queue. On my return leg from Tianjin to Guangzhou, airport staff noticed a random, irrelevant series of digits where my travel document number should have been. This was likely the fault of my travel agent whom I booked the ticket with. Regardless, the check-in staff was not able to check me in, and sent me to a China Southern kiosk to resolve the issue. In the end, the kiosk employee was able to change my ID number in the system to match my travel document so I could be checked in. One event taking away from my high opinion of China Southern was this employee's stubbornness and hesitance to change the travel document number for a low-risk individual who obviously had a valid travel document. She initially told us that it was not possible for her to do so (which was not a truthful statement), and insisted I contact my travel agent, which resulted in my friend and myself having to turn on roaming to call the travel agent back in Canada and was a huge inconvenience. After having no luck, she apparently realized that I had successfully checked into my Guangzhou to Toronto return leg and was convinced that I was legitimate, and then changed my number in the system. In hindsight, she took conservative measures, which are reasonable but in my opinion overkill for a low-risk passenger. She realized that I had little time left, and quickly finished the change and directed me to the supervisor line, which was a saving grace to the ordeal and restored some of my respect for the airline. Ultimately, this had no impact on my flight, but it was a stressful and arguably unnecessarily complicated process. Inflight entertainment has a good selection of both Chinese, international, and Hollywood movies, TV shows, music and games. This was my first time taking a shuttle bus from the gate to the plane (at Guangzhou for the departure leg). Although China Southern communicated gate changes and delays promptly and clearly, the airline did not communicate that we would be riding a shuttle bus. As a result of this, I leisurely took my time and ended up standing for the 10-minute bus ride. Partially my fault, admittedly. Conclusion: Overall, a good airline that exceeds options we have in North America.",Economy Class,3,4,5,4,5,yes,1568,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Toronto to Tianjin via Guangzhou,August 2018,3,,China Southern Airlines,China

2018-09-25,"""food was mediocre at best""",3,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seoul to Amsterdam via Beijing. First of all my partner and I did not choose to fly with China Southern. Our flight with KLM from Seoul to Amsterdam was cancelled and the replacements issued were with CSA. Everything starts with the check in which is where the issues started. I was able to check in for the short flight Seoul to Beijing on their website but unable to book a seat for the Beijing to Amsterdam connection, my partner had no issues for both flights. In the end we did have to go to the counter and we don't have a lot of experience with the ground staff of CSA as check in was done by Korean Air in Seoul. It was an overall pleasant experience with the Korean Air staff but they were unable to book the whole trip for us (after Amsterdam we had a connecting flight home to Ireland) or make any changes to the seats selected. The flight from Seoul to Beijing was uneventful and for the short distance a snack and something to drink was included. Unfortunately the quality of the food can be improved (dry tiny sandwiches with not taste or texture). We were put in economy plus for the flight due to the short layover in Beijing to make it to our connecting flight. There was plenty of legroom but the plane was old and outdated. Unlike other people's experiences we did have staff waiting for us when we got off the plane in Beijing to help us with the luggage transfer and through Chinese security. It was actually helpful since our flight to Beijing was delayed by half an hour the process needed to be speedy (as others have stated lack of communication with passengers in regards to delays especially in this case when they were well aware that they had 4 international passengers that needed to transfers). Just be prepared to have your hand luggage turned upside down with no respect for personal belongings. I think they ran our bags through the scanner 5 times despite removing all requested items that go through the scanner separately. Initially my partner and I were supposed to be seated apart during the long flight from Beijing to Amsterdam but got lucky since so many people wanted to change seats that we eventually had chance to sit together. Compared to A380 from other airlines there was less legroom in the main deck economy area and the seats were uncomfortable so sleeping was possible just not for long. Again the food was mediocre at best. Dinner was tasteless chicken with more tasteless mash or fish and rice where only the rice and sauce were edible, the veg was pretty undercooked. At least there were a plenty of chances to get water or something else to drink. Breakfast was an omelette, okay but not great. In flight entertainment had a lot of good choices with some recent movies and there was enough to keep us busy during the flight. Only regret is no map to check flight progress and little communication of the staff with passengers where we are. For an international flight I would have hoped to have staff that has decent English unfortunately most of time it was hard to figure out where Chinese ended and English started during announcements. Our luggage made it to our final destination with no issues but we could see that both of our suitcases were opened and searched Would I recommend this airline?

2018-11-12,"""a terrible experience""",1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seoul to London via Wuhan on 9/10 October. This was a terrible experience my partner and I had with China Southern. We were stranded at Wuhan Tianhe airport with no hotel and no help from China Southern, as there was no staff to help us. As we landed at 00:35, we found ourselves in a very unpleasant situation. A few days before our flight I called China Southern's customer care line to enquire about booking a hotel for our stopover, and the person I spoke to on the phone told me that hotel bookings for stopovers at Wuhan airport cannot be done over the phone, but there was no need to make a booking as I simply had to go to the transfer counter located near boarding gate number 36 of Wuhan Airport where China Southern's staff would help me and my partner find a hotel. Just to be sure, I also sent an email to [email protected] as indicated on the China Southern website for booking hotels for overnight stays, however no one replied to my email. On the day of the flight, at Incheon airport, I looked for China Southern's offices and spoke to their staff, who told me the same thing as customer service. They could not book a hotel for us, because it would be done by China Southern staff located at the transit counter at Wuhan airport. I asked repeatedly for confirmation whether there would be someone to help us at our time of our arrival and we were assured that there would be. Upon our arrival to Wuhan airport, we saw no one from China Southern. All counters and desks were empty, and we had to go around the airport quite a few times asking for China Southern staff, but everyone told us there wasn't anyone as they were closed. At this point we asked for help to a member of staff of Wuhan Airport, he was kind enough to call China Southern on our behalf and ask about what had happened. China Southern's customer service told him that they couldn't provide us with a hotel because we didn't make a reservation beforehand, which is clearly not true, as we repeatedly contacted China Southern about making a reservation and we were always told that no reservation was needed. China Southern offered no help whatsoever and we saw ourselves at 2am in Wuhan Airport with no hotel and a stopover of almost 14 hours. We had to find and pay for a hotel by ourselves after wasting a lot of time seeking help from China Southern, which didn't come at any point. Furthermore, we were not the only passengers with the same problem as there were other passengers from South Korea on our same flight who were also left with no hotel and no help. It seems clear that no China Southern staff was present at the transfer counters or the airport in general. I have put a formal complaint by phone, email and in person and it's now been over a month and no one from China Southern has gotten back to me and keeps brushing me off by telling me that my complain has been ""forwarded to the relevant department"". If I had known this would have happened I would have happily paid more for a flight with another company as we ended up paying a lot of money and wasting time with China Southern's incompetent staff.",Economy Class,2,3,3,3,1,no,1608,,Couple Leisure,Seoul to London via Wuhan,October 2018,1,,China Southern Airlines,China

Nonetheless, seats are not equipped with personal in flight entertainment (IFE) . Instead drop down LED screen are available. The cabin crew were seen busy preparing food approximately 20 minutes after departure. I am delighted with the efficiency rendered by the crew. One meal cart was utilised for the distribution of mineral water and one for hot meal purpose. On view of short flight time of less than 2 hours, only one hot meal choice was served. Flight attendant returned for the tray and trash collection as soon as the passengers were done with the meal. The standard of the cabin service is satisfactory.

2018-12-05,"""pretty good service""",7,"✅ Trip Verified |  Shenyang to Guangzhou. Since I am a sky team elite member (China Southern will no longer be part of sky team starting in 2019), I took advantage of the perks and went to the VIP check in. Customer service checked all of my hefty luggage with no trouble at all. I was also able to rest a bit at the VIP Lounge. There’s snacks, warm food (two dishes), assorted drinks, and hot water for tea. Surprisingly there were also six massage chairs. However, everything is a big old and overused, including the toilet. This place could use a renovation. Similarly for the plane I took to Guangzhou the seats were outdated and the armrests look like they’ve been scratched for a while. There was no in-flight entertainment on this short connecting flight, which is in accordance to other shorter flights I’ve taken with China Southern. Also, no WiFi. There’s a few spelling errors in the safety instruction video. I think what the video wanted to say instead of ditching was “water-landing”. However, the customer service was amazing on this flight. There was an old couple sitting in front of me, and the air stewardesses was super attentive. They asked multiple times if the couple was warm enough, comfortable enough, had hot water, etc. The longer flight (CAN to LAX) was carried out on an Airbus, which I prefer. There was an entertainment system for each passenger, but since it is an older model, the systems did not have USB ports. Again, no WiFi. The service on this flight was a bit lackluster. Although the stewardesses were kind and polite, they failed to retrieve hot towels in time (the tables are super small), didn’t hand out refreshments timely. Lastly, I would like to comment on the meals. I am an ovo-lacto vegetarian (can eat eggs and dairy), so I ordered special meals. I had heard that China Southern upped their flight meals, and from my dad’s meals, it really did seem so. However, my special veg meals were so bland I had to splay salt and pepper all over the food. There’s a lack of variety as well.

We bought the ticket from Paris to Ho Chi Minh city in November 2018. On the depart trip from Paris to Ho Chi Minh: we lost 1 baggage and received it at home after that. On the return from Ho Chi Minh to Paris: When we arrived at the airport in Vietnam for check-in at counter, the employee of China Southern informed us that the flight from Guangzhou to Paris was cancelled, we had to stay at Guangzhou one day for the next flight. We already purchased the air ticket from Paris to Québec with Air Canada, we couldn’t not stay at Guangzhou one day. We asked them why the flight was cancelled without advance notice. They’d just explained us that: ‘’Because the flight from Guanzhou to Paris was cancelled on Oct 16th, 2018 and the system changed you into next flight on next day automatically’’. We required them to find another flight for us. We showed them our ticket with Air Canada to tell them that we couldn’t miss the flight from Paris to Québec. Finally, they found another flight for us to Paris with more connecting flight, 3 flights totally instead of 2 flights. We had no choice and accepted this option. They couldn’t print the boarding pass for us from Amsterdam – Paris since they cooperated with KLM, we had to print it at Amsterdam. When we arrived at Amsterdam airport, the next flight was after only 45 – 60 mins before boarding time. We had to run quickly in the airport with a baby to pass the customs airport/ security and find the place to print the boarding pass. Fortunately, we had arrived at the port to the airline on time. When we arrived at Paris airport, we didn’t found our 3 baggage and we come back to Canada without them. We received them at our house in Canada after 1 day. We was really disappointed why our flight from Guangzhou to Paris was cancelled without advance notice by email/ telephone?

This was my 4th time to fly China Southern Airlines. I like the A380 because it is very quiet and comfortable. However, their A380 is starting to look dated. I booked my flight directly on their website, however, they do not allow seat reservations for the upper deck. They did a couple of years ago. It's a shame because i booked it directly and not from another website. If you want the upper deck seats you'll have to pay Y100 per segment.  I also ordered a ""diabetic"" meal, and that was not satisfying. So, I deleted that for the next flights. The meals are less stellar than they used to be.  The seats are the same, stiff.  The transfer at Guangzhou airport was ok, but if you walk slow, it'll take you a while because the new terminal is huge. There are two security checks. The second one is through the x-ray machines.  That takes a lot more time and the queue gets slower to the x-ray machines. The flight to MNL was uneventful. On the return flight, the snafu started after the plane landed on the tarmac. We had to be bused to the new Terminal for international transfer. Because the lay over time is only 1 hour and 10 minutes to LAX, almost everyone is in a hurry. Again, the two times security check is the culprit. Apparently, almost every connecting flight is leaving late because of it. My LAX flight was delayed an hour from waiting for connecting passengers. When we arrived at the gate, it was still boarding. The chaotic and unorganized transfer procedure was exhausting, to say the least. Despite the hour delay, the flight arrived in LAX on time.

( assuming you are transiting) On the outward leg, if transiting, you do not need to fill in the landing form. Go straight to immigration and get a 30 day visa. Do not join the queue for having your photograph for a visa. If you are requiring a visa then join the queue. They take your passport, take a photo and then hand back your passport with the visa. (you pay first). If your flight arrives in the early hours of the morning the airport is very cold so keep hold of a jacket. Also, there is very little open and some food outlets only take Chinese currency. I have no complaints regarding China Southern, you get what you pay for. If you want more leg room, a better quality of food and a larger selection of movies then pay double the price for a better known airline.",Economy Class,2,4,3,2,3,no,1697,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,London to Phu Quoc via Guangzhou,March 2019,4,,China Southern Airlines,China

Travelling with my wife Furnari from Sydney to LA, but we chose to transfer in Hong Kong, stayed for one day, and then caught our long flight to LA in Guangzhou. I found it was the best way to get tickets at the most reasonable price. We just landed in LA couple hours ago, and I just want to show my appreciation for all the crew members who helped us during the past 12 hours. At first, I found out my seat was broken and there was a huge empty part on my lower seatback. I asked a flight attendant to get me a big pillow to block it. He came out with a better solution by offering us three joint seats. That was very nice of him. Secondly, we forgot to apply for the special meals. We bought some vegan food before leaving Sydney, but we finished them all in Hong Kong. I told the crew I was wondering if they can gave us some vegan food, and she told me they had some extra vegan and vegetarian meals today, lucky us, we can have some. We are so grateful for their great kindness and professionality. Despite the shortage of the hardware, they really have amazing service skills.

Our flight, CZ368 on 28 March was scheduled to take off at 8:00am but after sitting in the plane for 2.5 hours later, we were told to get off the plane due to technical problems. There were no announcements or updates given once we get off the plane. China Southern barely provided any useful information or any staff presence in the next 12 hours. We were receiving conflicting take off time announcements from our emails and from the PA system in the airport. The new take off times went from 2:30pm to 5:30pm then back to 3:30pm, and again back to 5:30pm, and then again to 9:00pm. When asked about the 9:00pm take off time, the one China Southern manager who was really hard to find asked us what we meant about the new take off time, who was sending us those emails, and told us not to trust those emails. He assured us that the flight was indeed taking off on-time at 5:30pm, promised their ground staff will make an announcement at 5:00pm and be available to assist the passengers. At 5:00pm not a single staff showed up, 5:30pm rolled around and still no updates, finally at 5:40pm they made a PA announcement (still no staff) saying the new flight time is now 9:00pm. We ended up calling the entire work trip off as we were only going to spend 2 days in China and had already wasted a full day at the airport. China Southern staff promised a refund, but it's been 5 days since I've submitted a request for refund on their website and I have yet to hear back from them (their website said they would respond to all requests within 24 hours).

Offered us a refund, but as it was so late flights were so expensive we decided to stick with them and just go on another flight. This meant 2 stops in China and 6 hour wait in Guangzhou. Check in online is very clunky, couldn’t print off boarding passes for Guangzhou to Bali, also it made me and my partner sit apart for 5 hours. Staff at check in at LHR were very friendly and it went smooth. The flight itself was fine no issues. IFE could of been a tad better, but nothing to complain about. The annoyance started when we landed in Sanya, you had to obtain a 72 hour visa even though you were transiting which was long (and we were the only flight that had landed for some time). 5 security checks later we are finally airside. We had 2 hours in SYX then an 1.30hr flight to Guangzhou. 6 hours there at night is hard. The flight then to Bali was a narrow body with no IFE. Which having the 2 stops and 6 hours in Guangzhou was annoying, but not the end of the world. Snacks and water were given throughout the flight. We landed on time and that flight was also ok. We would never of chosen this option but it was the hand that was dealt to us. I’m reserving judgment for the return leg. At this moment, I would recommend the airline but not this route.

The seat was not so good though, but I did enjoy watching a lot of fun movies and TV shows.

After that, we weren't told any additional information or how long the wait will be while we sat watching other flights leave on time. Boarding finally started 3 hours behind schedule with no announcement or apology. The A321 clearly showed signs of age, as the seat cushions were worn out and flattened by years of use, making the seat uncomfortable. The flight was only 2 hours long, but we were served a hot meal (which included rice, fish and chicken) around an hour after departure along with a bottle of water. The food itself tasted bland and flavourless but I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that China Southern even serves food as some Chinese carriers only hand out bottled water on flights of similar lengths.

2019-08-25,"""Expedia ticket that was unchangeable""",5,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Vientiane via Guangzhou. Part of the problem is that I booked through Expedia. I spent more time on the phone about this booking than any other flight. Expedia refers the customer to the CZ website to manage the flight, seat selection, meals, etc. But the website will only open to customers who have booked at the site! Expedia does not link! The U.S. phone number for CZ is Pacific Time, limited daytime hours, and I never had any of my calls answered, even after long waits. I called the office in China, who did answer the phone, and they were helpful; however, when it came time to pay for seat confirmation, only Chinese credit cards were accepted, no MC or Visa or AMEX. So I could not pre-book a seat. I was only able to select a seat when I checked in at JFK on a return flight (after most seats were already assigned). Even worse, without informing me, Expedia booked me on a ticket that was unchangeable!  In this case, I had to purchase an entirely new ticket (through Expedia) for my return flight, for $754, expecting reimbursement. Even though the representative and her supervisor acknowledged that I was not properly informed, it still took considerable effort to get Expedia to agree to reimburse $500. Flight times were on schedule, often arriving early. Connection through Guangzhou is a little difficult, with a long walk to the connection. Boarding is disorganized and a scramble. Onboard, staff are courteous and friendly, with limited but acceptable English. For entertainment, the LED screen is new, bright and crisp, with a relatively good selection of English language programming. Food in Economy is mediocre. In 8 meals, I was served fruit twice and yoghurt once. Chocolate never. Cheese never. No breakfast meal (eggs, potatoes, sausage, pancakes).  Between meals, no peanuts, candy bars, apples, oranges, bananas, chips, or other snacks were available, only boxes of noodle soup. Similarly, there was a very limited selection of drinks. No comfort packs were distributed (eyeshade, toothbrush, etc). I make this trip between Laos and the U.S. frequently, generally using Middle-East carriers (Qatar, Etihad). the trip is very long, generally with 2 connections and significant airport waiting time. This new alternative on CZ has only one quick connection, and a total of only 20 hrs between boarding and disembarking. For this reason alone, I will again select CZ.

As I got onboard, I was told the flight is going to stop in Wuhan through public announcement, which means I had to transit two times my whole journey. That was quite frustrating.

They have asked cabin staff to look for such a seat that suit their needs, including one that is near the washroom.

2019-11-24,"""Service is very consistent""",9,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Sydney return via Guangzhou. I had been a little anxious but I ended up very impressed. The website is truly dreadful and we battled with it. However we were able to preselect seats. This is free for some seats and many of the other seats are available for a nominal fee. Online checkin was a bit glitchy but there is a dedicated online checkin line at the airport and because people don't seem to use online checkin, on each occasion it allowed us to completely avoided queuing. The baggage allowance in Economy is 2 x 23kg bags.  All four flights left on time. The flight schedules were great and far better on the kangaroo route than BA or QF. I chose daylight flights on all sectors (except London - Guangzhou). China Southern give you a free transit hotel if your flight involves a transit stop of more than eight hours. This worked well and broke up the return flight when we weren't actually staying in Guangzhou, although it's worth noting that it's not a particularly quick process. You first need to get a transit visa (which involves plenty of hanging around) and then go to a desk in the arrivals hall where you can choose your hotel. You then wait to be escorted to a bus which will take you to the hotel. It took more than two hours from arrival to get to my room and the hotel wanted to put me on a return bus 3.5 hrs before the flight left. I pushed that back by half an hour but still, given my transit was 16 hrs it was fine. An 8 hr transit wouldn't give you much time in the hotel! As for the flights, there was plenty of legroom, particularly on the 787. Service was a little robotic (few smiles) but very efficient and consistent. Two hot meals were served on each sector and the crew had (uninspiring) snacks if you asked for them between meals. Drinks options were limited (few people seemed to be drinking alcohol and they kept running out of Diet Coke). The IFE system was the best I have seen and there was enough content, albeit not as much in English as, say, on BA. A minor gripe - they insist on closing the windows on daylight flights. It didn't matter on the 787 as you can still see out and unlike other airlines they don't lock the windows in the dark position, but on the A330 it was a pain. My conclusion? I worked for BA for many years, latterly working with their inflight product. CZ was in general far, far better in economy than BA. Service is very consistent, relatively generous and at £400 cheaper than BA, it was a complete no brainer.

2021-04-12,"""I want to say thank you again""",9,"✅ Trip Verified |  The service of one Check-In Counter Manager from China Southern Airlines was outstanding. UK government requires all passengers to have the negative covid test certificate prior boarding. Due to my carelessness, I overlooked the requirement that it needs to be translated into one of the 3 languages (English, Spanish or French). When I showed up in the airport counter at 8pm on Thur night (8/4/21), they told me I couldn't fly. The issue is that I have already booked everything in the UK for the quarantine requirements, such as covid tests and government forms and notify the quarantine location and isolation period. It will be a logistic nightmare to rebook everything, not to say I have to pay for everything again! Feeling hopeless and pressure to step aside for other passengers, I approached the counter manager who was very kind and understanding. He asked around to see if possible to fly with the Covid Test certificate in Chinese. To no avail, it's not possible. He told me there are translation companies which can do urgent translation services. I told him that I am not a local and have no clue where to find these companies. He helped me find a translation company, communicated with them and told them what it's required by the airline and the UK Immigration. Then he told me where to print it out in the airport once I received the translated certificate. This type of service I would called it ""Above and Beyond"" any customer's expectation. We are all living in a fast pace society, and quite often brush away others when they needed help unconsciously. Sometimes we really need to take time to appreciate other's kindness.
