2017-10-15,Best to avoid ryanair,5.0,"i booked the flights with ryanair months ago on the basis of price and appropriate dates, only to have the goalposts moved later, so that i needed to pay for seats in order to ensure that my wife and i sat together. later still, the cancellation farrago threw the whole holiday into doubt until ryanair was forced to publish the lists of flights affected and we learned that our flights were still on. then the day before we flew we received an email warning of a ban on carrying alcohol into the cabin and telling us what would happen to any alcohol bought in the ""duty-free"" shops. this did not affect us directly as we never buy any ""duty-free"" but we did wonder whether the flight was going to be full of hen and stag parties. by then, any faith we might have had in ryanair was pretty well dispelled and we had no high hopes of the flights themselves. in the event everything went fairly smoothly. boarding for the outward flight was handled efficiently by a single agent while the cabin crew were both pleasant and hardworking. the cabin manager, in particular, carried out her duties very responsibly (for example, not starting the safety demonstration until she was sure that she had the attention of practically everyone on board) but with good humour. there was some changing of seats before we departed, but we were only a few minutes late rolling back. we arrived early (cue the awful triumphal blast) after an uneventful journey. for the return flight, boarding was slightly delayed though it did not impact upon our actual departure time. the cabin crew again worked hard but it was difficult to hear any of their announcements, due to the speed with which they were made plus the conversation level within the cabin. the actual flight was equally uneventful and we arrived marginally early, so we had the trumpet blast again, which this time was greeted by ironic cheers. after all the various alarms beforehand, therefore, we made it there and back without any real bother, but my wife and i have still decided that we will do our best to avoid ryanair in the future. how can you trust a company that changes the rules after you have booked, yet denies it has done so, or cancels flights on a whim and tries to wriggle out of any of the consequences? my overall rating here therefore balances out the pluses of the actual flights against the minuses of the doubts and uncertainties beforehand.",Economy Class,2.0,4.0,-1.0,3.0,False,1127,Couple Leisure,Manchester to Palma,October 2017,-1.0,Boeing 737-800,4.0,-1.0,Ryanair,Ireland,False

2019-04-19,Read the fine print,1.0,"manchester to barcelona. read the fine print very carefully. i did not, and i paid dearly.  luggage: included in the cost is what you can fit under the seat in front of you. it appears they purposefully spread your group out in the cabin. for example, i had an empty seat next to me on one of our flights, yet they didn't seat my young daughter and i together. she was in the rear of the plane and i was up front. seating together costs extra. technically they charge for choosing your seat, but again, my opinion is that it seems they make an effort to spread families around the plane unless you pay for the seating option. their check-in process is a scam. you will receive an email 3 days before travel telling you to check in online or you will be charged 55 pounds. okay, fair enough because they have warned you with a personal email, until you try to check in. after you enter all your passport and personal information for you and your party and go through all that hassle and get to the end of the check-in process, they'll tell you that you have to pay a fee to check in prior to 48 hours before departure. if you forget (like i did) and remember to do so once you arrive at the airport 1 hour and 59 minutes before your flight (like i did) and try to check in online, it will cost you 55 pounds per ticket.  here's the process: a) wait in the queue at check in. the check in person informs you that you owe a fee. she fills out the a form (by hand) that you have to take to customer service. wait in the queue at customer service. pay your fee (which for us doubled the cost of our tickets). they fill out another form by hand (including credit card information by hand) and stamp it. you have to take this new form back to check in. wait for a second time in the check in queue. you hand her this second form and she finally issues the boarding passes. run to security because although you arrived 1 hour and 59 minutes early, most of that time has now been spent in 3 queues just to get a boarding pass. again, read the fine print and understand what you are in fo. i recognize my own failings working with ryanair, but it really seems like their process is designed to cause a certain number of passengers to fail at their game and when you fail, you pay so dearly.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,False,1532,Family Leisure,Manchester to Barcelona,April 2019,-1.0,Not informed,1.0,-1.0,Ryanair,Ireland,True

2019-09-25,Cannot find any positive aspect,1.0,"frankfurt to valencia. i cannot find any positive aspect of traveling with ryanair. 1. booking system of ryanair: it is as shitty as you expect it to be from a low cost airline. the prices seem to appear low at first sight but in the end you end up with ruffly the same amount as with other airlines. they try to sell you so much shit you don't need. like it was worth being in boarding group 1, going through a ""fast lane check in""... in the end you just wait as long as everyone else because it doesn't make the whole boarding faster, but ryanair sends you emails saying ""better buy it, don't lose time at the airport, board hands free,..."" putting you under pressure to buy all the extras. why would you need to book extra ""sitting together""? despite the fact that you are able to spend 2 hours in a plane without sitting together and if needed kindly ask one of the other passengers to change seats. ryanair's seat booking system could easily make you sit next to each other but it doesn't do it on purpose so you spend again extra 7€ or more just to sit to your beloved. all buttons on ryanair's website which say something like ""add to card"" are highlighted but the ones which say ""skip"" are not just to make you feel you need to buy stuff. 2. the actual flight: in the airplane the whole tables are screwed to the seat so customers can't eat from them and the seats got no bags for your laptop etc. so ryanair ""saves time"" during the cleanup for the next flight. of course they always have some ""special offers"" in the air and they disturb you several times wanting you to buy parfumé or other stuff that you ""need right now"". 3. and what's about the luggage thing?! it always was a wired thing in every airline but ryanair took it to another level. as it would matter if 2 kg too much on the luggage are taken out and put in your hand luggage, it's still on the same airplane?! ryanair changed the policy of luggage in november 2018. so a normal hand luggage (55x40x20) that counts for every other airline is considered to be normal luggage for ryanair now. and of course everyone who takes his old loved hand luggage now to the boarding gate is stopped by ryanair and charged 25€ extra. so by bearing everything written in here in mind i cannot book any flights with ryanair anymore and i don't recommend it to everyone else who are thinking about it. globalization okay yes - but ryanair is one of the bad examples of it.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,False,1711,Couple Leisure,Frankfurt to Valencia,September 2019,1.0,Not informed,1.0,1.0,Ryanair,Ireland,True

2023-04-21,Will never fly with ryanair again,1.0,"i had thought ryanair would have improved over the years, but i was completely wrong. the cheap flights are completely offset by added charges. firstly with bags, the size they provide as acceptable cabin bags are miniscule - barely enough to fit a days worth of clothes and items - so we purchased a cabin bag. the cabin bag they allow is the size of a usual carry on; the small wheeled suitcases so many people use. however when we got to check in, everyone with us (after the priority boarding) had these suitcases with no problem? we paid to have a bag checked in, when everyone else carried theirs on with no problem. that was £55 extra. we then had to pay to sit next to each other, as i was travelling with my partner. we paid for this on one flight, and for the return flight we checked in as soon as online check in was open. even though there were only a couple of seats already booked and the entire plane was empty, it deliberately seated us far apart in order to make us pay more. when it says they cannot guarantee you will be seated next to each other, take it to mean they will deliberately seat you far apart in order to get more money from you. finally on the flight, having a flight attendant scream right next to you, as they yell at their colleague at the other end of the plane was interesting. even more so was the aggressive way they do anything. i walk using a walking aid, and i called up to check this was ok before i boarded. after being told it was ok and that i would be able to keep the walking aid between my legs, an attendant roughly grabbed it on the flight and shoved it into an already full overhead locker, and then slammed it shut several times until it closed. this cracked and damaged the walking aid and i've now had to purchase another. when i submitted a complaint about this, i was told i needed to have filled in a particular form at the airport. i have never had an attendant damage the items i use to walk around before, and at no point does it say that if anything is damaged you need to fill in a form at the airport. i was then stuck in a loop of calling in to discuss this issue, being told to reply to an email and then being told they would do nothing as this form was not filled in. ryanair remains a predatory airline - you will not pay the low amount you see online. avoid them, and give your money to any of the other budget airlines if you're looking to save money. will never fly with ryanair again.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,False,2146,Couple Leisure,Stansted to Venice,March 2023,1.0,Not informed,1.0,1.0,Ryanair,Ireland,True
