2017-07-06,Put me off flying with them again,3.0,"this covers sydney to beijing via shenzhen and beijing to sydney via guangzhou, on two separate return journeys. the first was in march 2017 and the second was outbound in june and return in july. i’ve flown china southern a few times in the past and been happy, but these two trips were enough to put me off flying with them again if i can possibly avoid it. while most china southern long-haul flights offer seat-back tvs in economy, this is not available on the sydney to shenzhen route. chinese airlines ban the use of mobile phones, even in in-flight mode. so you can either hope your laptop has eight hours of battery life, or bring a book. international-to-domestic transfer in shenzhen is shambolic. i’ve done similar transfers, with cz and other airlines, in other chinese airports, and it can be slightly chaotic, but shenzhen is in a different league. after disembarking and going through passport control, passengers are vaguely pointed to a fenced-off area near baggage reclaim with a few chairs, no food and no water. we are told to stay there “for a while” – there is never any indication as to how long that “while” might be, or as to why we might be waiting. on the march flight, it was a little over an hour; on the june flight, it was a little over 90 minutes. both times, this left me with no time to buy food or drinks in departures before my connecting flight. after the march flight, i found out that we were all made to wait there while customs – out of sight of us – inspects our checked luggage before it can be transferred to our connecting flights. this was not explained by cz or airport staff. passengers for connecting flights are called forward one flight at a time, and are then given vague directions as to where to go next, for a security check before proceeding to departures. on both occasions, i had to translate for bewildered non-chinese-speaking passengers as announcements (by an ill-tempered lady with a megaphone) were only made in chinese. domestic flights are woefully unreliable. while my shenzhen to beijing flights were both only an hour or two late, the beijing-guangzhou flights were extremely late: by eight hours in march and by six and a half hours in july. at no point until push-back could the fas or ground staff tell us how long the delay might be. for the july flight, we boarded the plane three hours late, and then sat in the plane at the gate for three and a half hours. on both occasions we were told the delay was due to “weather”. of course, what that means is that there is a storm, or a potential storm, on the narrow corridor that the military has opened up to commercial operations, and that it is impossible to fly around the storm without leaving that corridor. this makes it practically impossible for domestic airlines to run north to south routes to timetable during the stormy season between march and september. it seems that the only way to get around this is to fly directly from a foreign country east of china to your final destination in china: in future i will try to use korean, japanese and filipino airlines to get to beijing, or fly directly from sydney to shanghai on china eastern and then make my connection to beijing by train. it’s a shame. fas are generally quite helpful, and seat pitch is excellent by economy-class standards. but flying on cz with a connection to northern china is totally impractical.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,False,1116,A330 / A321,Business,Sydney to Beijing via Shenzhen,July 2017,1.0,Not informed,China Southern Airlines,China,False

2017-11-08,You'll need a chinese visa,1.0,"wow, by far the worst customer service i've ever had. our flight was booked from melbourne to amsterdam via shenzhen and beijing and return from amsterdam to melbourne via beijing and guangzhou. we each thrice checked for visa requirements and were both under the impression that china has a 24-hr transit visa. wrong! some cities/airlines do not apply to this. we were taken to the service desk and waited for an hour before they told us our best options were cancel & rebook new flights, or call the airline to find a way around the cities that needed visas, or risk it for the biscuit. we nearly risked it but decided to do our 1st option (despite the prices, it was a safer bet)! so onto asking for a cancellation and refund request. the website was outdated stating that website works were underway (however the dates had passed already), difficult to maneuver as some sections were in chinese, and when i attempted to apply for a refund, it sent me to a 404 error page. previous to that, no confirmation emails/texts had been sent to my email address/mobile despite the multiple requests.  we called the airline line, was on hold for hours (as you might've anticipated) and then were told to call the office in australia (which was closed due to the public holiday) and that they couldn't help us. after insisting, they told us to send an email with details of our trip and our passports and to call back when we received a response email regarding our cancellation/refund, which shouldn't take longer than 10-15 minutes. email sent. 20 minutes passed. no email. so we call back, wait for another half hour and (of course) speak to a different agent. this agent says very abruptly ""there's a 30-minute processing time from when we receive your email. call back when you get it. bye."" and she hangs up before we get a chance to respond with anything. it's been over an hour and 15 minutes now and we still haven't received an email. bottom line: don't fly with this airline if you're a foreigner and don't have any intention of going to china. their tickets might seem cheap if you're transiting through the country, but unless you have a chinese passport, prepare yourself for tagteaming and chasing customer service. if you do travel with this airline, check all connecting airports to ensure they qualify under the 24-hr transit permit, and if not, then you'll need a chinese visa which takes >3-4 weeks to process. if you book through a travel agent, it is their job to tell you if you need a visa.",Economy Class,1.0,Not informed,Not informed,Not informed,1.0,False,1228,Not informed,Couple Leisure,Melbourne to Amsterdam via Shenzhen / Beijing,November 2017,1.0,Not informed,China Southern Airlines,China,False

2018-09-17,Overall a good airline,8.0,"toronto to tianjin via guangzhou. the meals on these particular routes were chinese in style; my travel companion, who rarely eats airplane food, called the meals delicious and i found the meals quite suited to a chinese palate. the passengers on both the departure and return flight were very demanding. despite this, the stewardesses were quick and patient in their services, providing blankets, headphones, and pillows during boarding. china southern and xiamen boarded their flights in an orderly fashion and organized their queues in such a way as to prevent passengers from later zones from sneaking into the front. passengers who did so were told to line up in their queue. on my return leg from tianjin to guangzhou, airport staff noticed a random, irrelevant series of digits where my travel document number should have been. this was likely the fault of my travel agent whom i booked the ticket with. regardless, the check-in staff was not able to check me in, and sent me to a china southern kiosk to resolve the issue. in the end, the kiosk employee was able to change my id number in the system to match my travel document so i could be checked in. one event taking away from my high opinion of china southern was this employee's stubbornness and hesitance to change the travel document number for a low-risk individual who obviously had a valid travel document. she initially told us that it was not possible for her to do so (which was not a truthful statement), and insisted i contact my travel agent, which resulted in my friend and myself having to turn on roaming to call the travel agent back in canada and was a huge inconvenience. after having no luck, she apparently realized that i had successfully checked into my guangzhou to toronto return leg and was convinced that i was legitimate, and then changed my number in the system. in hindsight, she took conservative measures, which are reasonable but in my opinion overkill for a low-risk passenger. she realized that i had little time left, and quickly finished the change and directed me to the supervisor line, which was a saving grace to the ordeal and restored some of my respect for the airline. ultimately, this had no impact on my flight, but it was a stressful and arguably unnecessarily complicated process. inflight entertainment has a good selection of both chinese, international, and hollywood movies, tv shows, music and games. this was my first time taking a shuttle bus from the gate to the plane (at guangzhou for the departure leg). although china southern communicated gate changes and delays promptly and clearly, the airline did not communicate that we would be riding a shuttle bus. as a result of this, i leisurely took my time and ended up standing for the 10-minute bus ride. partially my fault, admittedly. conclusion: overall, a good airline that exceeds options we have in north america.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,True,1568,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Toronto to Tianjin via Guangzhou,August 2018,1.0,Not informed,China Southern Airlines,China,True

2019-11-24,Service is very consistent,9.0,"london to sydney return via guangzhou. i had been a little anxious but i ended up very impressed. the website is truly dreadful and we battled with it. however we were able to preselect seats. this is free for some seats and many of the other seats are available for a nominal fee. online checkin was a bit glitchy but there is a dedicated online checkin line at the airport and because people don't seem to use online checkin, on each occasion it allowed us to completely avoided queuing. the baggage allowance in economy is 2 x 23kg bags.  all four flights left on time. the flight schedules were great and far better on the kangaroo route than ba or qf. i chose daylight flights on all sectors (except london - guangzhou). china southern give you a free transit hotel if your flight involves a transit stop of more than eight hours. this worked well and broke up the return flight when we weren't actually staying in guangzhou, although it's worth noting that it's not a particularly quick process. you first need to get a transit visa (which involves plenty of hanging around) and then go to a desk in the arrivals hall where you can choose your hotel. you then wait to be escorted to a bus which will take you to the hotel. it took more than two hours from arrival to get to my room and the hotel wanted to put me on a return bus 3.5 hrs before the flight left. i pushed that back by half an hour but still, given my transit was 16 hrs it was fine. an 8 hr transit wouldn't give you much time in the hotel! as for the flights, there was plenty of legroom, particularly on the 787. service was a little robotic (few smiles) but very efficient and consistent. two hot meals were served on each sector and the crew had (uninspiring) snacks if you asked for them between meals. drinks options were limited (few people seemed to be drinking alcohol and they kept running out of diet coke). the ife system was the best i have seen and there was enough content, albeit not as much in english as, say, on ba. a minor gripe - they insist on closing the windows on daylight flights. it didn't matter on the 787 as you can still see out and unlike other airlines they don't lock the windows in the dark position, but on the a330 it was a pain. my conclusion? i worked for ba for many years, latterly working with their inflight product. cz was in general far, far better in economy than ba. service is very consistent, relatively generous and at £400 cheaper than ba, it was a complete no brainer.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,True,1792,B787 and A330,Couple Leisure,London to Sydney via Guangzhou,November 2019,1.0,Not informed,China Southern Airlines,China,True
