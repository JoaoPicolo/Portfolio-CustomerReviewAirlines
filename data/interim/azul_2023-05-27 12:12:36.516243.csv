2020-02-11,Never set foot on an azul neo again,2,"lisbon to sao paulo. this is a tale of two aircraft in business class. outbound on a330-200, inbound a330 neo. i expected some differences between the experience on the different aircraft but was unprepared for what transpired. the a330-200 was comfortable, if perhaps a bit tired feeling. the a330 neo felt new but was the worst business class experience in memory. the neo cabin immediately felt claustrophobic upon entering. it felt as though they jammed in far too many seats in a small area. then the seats themselves were extraordinarily uncomfortable and equally as claustrophobic. it led to this being a surprisingly poor experience.  when in recline mode, your legs disappear and slide under the ife screen and other hardware of the shell. from mid thigh downward, you are trapped in a very narrow space which ends at about one foot high and less than one foot wide. it is impossible for your feet to rest without touching anything. it is impossible to roll over on your side and the height of your stacked knees and legs doesn't fit in the space.  extraordinarily uncomfortable, in fact the most uncomfortable business class seat in memory. was totally surprised that this happened on azul, as i would expect much, much better of them. it's clear to me that they rolled out this product without soliciting opinions of actual travelers, and they are responsible for this mess. the crew confirmed i wasn't the first to mention this. i vowed never to do this again, as it was a complete waste of money. the rest of the experience was actually good - professional crews, punctual flights, ok food but for me the seat is by far the only thing that matters and azul and airbus are both guilty of jointly delivering a terrible product. i would not recommend the neo and will never set foot on an azul neo again.",Business Class,1.0,False,69,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,A330-200 /  A330 Neo,Solo Leisure,Lisbon to Sao Paulo,February 2020,1.0,Not informed,Azul,Brazil,True
