2022-11-02,Management should be truly be ashamed,1.0,"so, i tried to heed the many warnings that i saw in this airline's terrible reviews regarding their baggage “scam” policy. i recently had a flight from mumbai to maldives, for which the ticket fare was $159 for a one-way ticket. still a little pricey, but not bad. the only reason why i took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the maldives. after booking the ticket, i noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance. my initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but i'm sure i can purchase a bag, just in case. the week of the flight, i spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. one problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. at 48 hours, i started the attempt to add a bag. the website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. when you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. neither of these buttons work. i tried on safari, chrome, and also my mobile. nada. the day before the flight, i spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. on my mobile, i was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. you click on that button and the screen goes blank. long story short, i had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. i finally found the loophole. when you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. it will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. add a bag. more confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). i thought, perfect! one catch, i didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on all the other airline websites out there. the morning of the flight, i saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so i added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. i get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. guy said that my bags were too heavy. i was so confused. i tried what i could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos total. doesn't say total on the website. so, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! what the ever living. that makes no sense. you pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. what a disaster. i ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. how the government allows this, i have no clue. i saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. good description, but more like extortion. i also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. you have been warned, do not use this airline. hopefully one day, a reputable airline like vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. and if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. there is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is greed. beware!",Economy Class,1,False,394,1.0,1.0,Not informed,Not informed,Solo Leisure,Not informed,Mumbai to Male,October 2022,1.0,Not informed,IndiGo,India,True
