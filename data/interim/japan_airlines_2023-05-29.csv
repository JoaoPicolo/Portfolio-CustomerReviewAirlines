2022-12-01,"Served one meal and one snack""",2.0,"the food, cabin, entertainment, and fluency were all disappointing. food: they raved so much about the food and even made a documentary to watch as part of their entertainment selection but my food from indonesia to us and back were all very mushy, bland, and confusing. they are kind of fusion japanese-western but failed to capture any of those elements. for my 14 hours flight, they only served one meal and one snack, both of which were not tasty at all. cabin: the seats were spacious but the flight was so so so warm i started sweating 10 minutes into the flight. it felt very stuffy. entertainment: they had very limited choices of movies. fluency: for some reason they did so many announcements, especially about their food. this kept interrupting the entertainment system. what was worse, the english announcement was very difficult to understand so it felt like they disrupt your flight and entertainment to listen to undistinguished noises.",Economy Class,2,False,383,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,Not informed,Couple Leisure,New York JFK to Jakarta via Tokyo Narita,November 2022,4.0,-1.0,Japan Airlines,Japan,True

2023-03-05,Very disappointed,3.0,"i am very disappointed because the airline would not allow me to book seats until check in. then my wife and i were assigned seats that were not together. we were unable to get anyone to even try to help. customer service pushed us off to ticketing. we showed up at 5am for our 8am flight as they instructed, only to be told to ask at the gate. we went to the gate and asked and, without even looking in the system the gate agent just told us they would not change our seats. this was not the customer service l that will make me want to fly this airline again! international premium trips are too expensive to be treated poorly. what's worse is a corporate culture that doesn't encourage problem solving/customer service. for example if they cared to try do you think they could've found 2 people in regular economy who would've liked premium economy seats? not 1 employee thought of that. i won't fly with them again.",Premium Economy,1,False,389,4.0,4.0,-1.0,3.0,Not informed,Couple Leisure,Bangkok to San Francisco via Tokyo Narita,March 2023,1.0,-1.0,Japan Airlines,Japan,True
