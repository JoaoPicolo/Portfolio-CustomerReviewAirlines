2018-08-08,Left a poor impression,4.0,"moscow to istanbul. aeroflot is definitely not a premium airline it thinks it is, because their economy experience is simply embarrassing. moscow - istanbul was on a 5-year old boeing 737-800, but the cabin looked like it was 15 years old with no maintenance. everything was scuffed, slightly teared, shaky etc. the seats were unbelievably, and i mean it, unbelievably tight. it was seriously painful to sit upright in the seat, because if you are of average height, your knees will be firmly pressed into the hard and rough metal bar, which is conveniently located right where your knees are supposed to be. the fact that the armrests were quite wide made the seat even less spacious. i lucked out in not having a neighbour in the next seat, but i seriously doubt it i would have handled the flight if it was 100% full. the cabin crew were grumpy and sloppy (with one exception), and their attitude regarding safety was unbelievable - they just didn't care. they never properly checked the cabin before take off and failed to enforce the safety rules (since they cared so little), so the plane took off with open tray tables, closed windows, passengers laying across the seats with no seatbelts, passengers streaming something from their devices with no headphones. i have never experienced anything like this, i felt like this was a bad dream or a good comedy, but it was neither. the meal service was alright. i ordered a kosher meal, which is always a fine choice on aeroflot, and it was much bigger than the regular meals. nothing extraordinary, plastic cutlery, no menus, but it was fine. there was no wine, beer or any other alcohol onboard, not even for purchase, which is just so embarrassing for the ""best airline of eastern europe"". i must also note that their main full-service competitors on this route - turkish airlines and atlasglobal - both serve beer and wine, and their meals are much tastier. there was no entertainment onboard. you could apparently stream entertainment via their wi-fi network, but it kept failing. the landing in istanbul was really rough, and then the plane spent 20 minutes slowly driving through the airport. the passengers thought it was a great time to stand up, open the overhead bins, start packing while the plane was in motion and something could easily fall down on someone's head, and the crew did nothing to stop it. so, once again, major safety hazard. istanbul-moscow was another story. it was boeing 737-800 with the same seating chart, but the plane was newer, and the seats were better. their design allowed for more legroom, and while it still wasn't spacious, it was tolerable. i still don't get why they decided to have a magazine pocket at the top of the seat (which is a great idea for maximising legroom) and at the knee level as well, because that doesn't make any sense from any perspective and shows poor management, but at least there were no metal bars this time. the seats felt super flimsy and cheap, though, with the whole row shaking and creaking whenever someone moved. i wonder if this plane will age well, because it seems like it will not. cabin crew were much more pleasant this time around, and they actually made sure the people were seated with their seatbelts on. no wine or beer once again. the kosher meal was exactly the same, which was fine. the flight was delayed for 30 minutes with no explanation or apology. overall, aeroflot left a poor impression, and i will make sure to avoid it.",Economy Class,3.0,False,436,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Moscow to Istanbul,August 2018,3.0,2.0,Aeroflot,Russia,True
