2016-03-30,Avoid this airline in the future,3.0,"oslo to dhaka via istanbul return. i have travelled with turkish airlines some times the past year, and it seems there is always is some sort of mishap - delays, technical problems with the entertainment system, booking of seats that doesn't exist etc. however, my past trip with made me wonder if they have heard of the term ""customer service"". i had booked their website. the trip passed through istanbul with one hour waiting time. at 2am the day before my trip (ie. 34 hours before departure) i received an email (and email only) that my flight to istanbul was 5 hours delayed, but there were no information about my flight from istanbul, so i called customer service. it turned out that my flight had been cancelled, and that i had been shifted on a later flight, but turkish hadn't thought about what effects that had on my flight from istanbul. the initial thought of the customer service was that i had to stay overnight at istanbul, and then take the flight the next day. there is only 1 flight from istanbul to my destination every day, so that meant that i were facing a 24 hours delay and that i would have to wait until 6pm before my flight departed. when i told the customer service that this was not doable, he said that there were seats available on the flight to istanbul on an earlier flight ( departure 7.30a, instead of noon), but that there were only business class seats left and that i had to upgrade my ticket. that is of course not acceptable. after 32 minutes on the phone with customer service, i got booked on to that earlier flight (giving me an 5 hours additional wait in istanbul, but at least not a 24 hour delay to my arrival time). when i boarded that flight, i was seated in one of the economy seats that were supposed to be unavailable, and it also turned out that there were plenty of free seats on economy class. what kind of customer service is this? unfortunately i had another horrible experience with turkish on my flight back, where i were denied to check-in because i met up at the airport 52 minutes before departure instead of the required 60 minutes. there were no problems in assisting the business class passenger who arrived at the same time as me, but i was rejected because of these 8 minutes. i have never been late on check-in before, but i have seen many exemples of airline companies bending over backwards to help their passengers (especially if it was the last flight for the day, or in this case the only). turkish would rather exploit it's customers. the irony is that this very trip was the one that earned me the last points for a membership upgrade. i will go to great lengths to avoid this airline in the future.",Economy Class,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,False,791,Solo Leisure,OSL to DAC via IST,November 2015,Not informed,1.0,-1.0,Turkish Airlines,Turkey,False

2018-05-17,Told my return had been cancelled,1.0,"on a recent ‘round-trip’ experience, denpasar - budapest, i found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with turkish airlines. when checking in on my return flight in budapest in may, 2018, i was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. as a result, i was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. below is a description of what had happened. in april, on the third leg of my flight from denpasar to budapest, i missed the flight in istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). i had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. when the line began to peter out i started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which i had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, i didn’t move forward. however, at that time i did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak english. at this point i was growing quite concerned and so i ran to the closest turkish airlines staff i could find, at a nearby counter. when i showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and i had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. this was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. i ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. they said that i had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. to do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. when outside, i first rushed to ticketing at turkish airlines where an employee stated that i had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the turkish airlines check-in desk. i then proceeded to the check-in desk at turkish airlines and they said that i had to purchase a new ticket. at no time i was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. i tried the help-phone for turkish airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. i finally had to purchase a one way ticket from istanbul to budapest for 200 euros for a flight later that day. to add insult to injury, the turkish airlines staff was appalling - i was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. i've read other reviews and some have said that turkish airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, i agree - note: this is specific to the istanbul airport staff. my original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. i reached out to turkish airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them. i suppose that is what they want!",Economy Class,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,False,1215,Solo Leisure,Denpasar to Budapest via KUL / IST,May 2018,Not informed,1.0,-1.0,Turkish Airlines,Turkey,True

2018-12-22,Worse than a low-cost airline,1.0,"brussels to istanbul via beirut. we have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. to start, we have booked our christmas tickets on july 1st to secure a place for a fair price. the night before the flight. we go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from istanbul to beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from brussels. the system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. we call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of december to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on december 21st. the only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in july to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. so being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this christmas, we took the 23rd december option. after that, i researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. i confirmed with another turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight i found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. however, now that i had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. to make the change we had to pay a 100€ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360€ per person to 680€ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn't do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. to try to rectify the situation, i have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. after staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. missed our solution option with the plane leaving. i stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. our file is ""still in process"" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. this company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. insults the customer and their intelligence. hires people who neither have the proper english nor the empathy to deal with a client. is frustrating and shameful. i am missing important family moments i have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. as for recommendations if you want to go to beirut. pegasus, a low cost, is much more efficient and respectful. middle east airlines was definitely a good experience, i had a problem once with aegean airlines, but they solved it on the spot not leaving for me room to complain.",Economy Class,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,False,1372,Couple Leisure,Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut,December 2018,Not informed,1.0,1.0,Turkish Airlines,Turkey,True

(we were just about to take off on a 11.5-hour journey with not enough fuel? interesting.) that just about put paid to everyone's plans to catch their connecting flights. the gate number for my geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as i found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). very stressful. on board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. english is not great unless pre-recorded. male crew are quite patient and hard-working. the female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be.

2019-02-20,Not friendly nor attentive,4.0,"montreal to berlin via istanbul. i was mostly disappointed with the services. i flew from montreal to istanbul and from the beginning i felt the experience to be flawed. there were some 28 business class seats and i had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. the seat is quite comfortable and large was what i noticed at first. the cabin crew was awful. they congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. as we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. i was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. i was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""no, later, later"". needless to say, i was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. the crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. we sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. the crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. i declined the drink and was asked if i wanted anything else and i ordered champagne. all drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and i thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in canada even on low cost carriers! menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. after take off, the service was not well planned. it took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! we had just left montreal at 1045 pm and i suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! i declined the offer for bedding and informed they that i would be ready for it after dinner. ""of course sir, anything you want"". the response lacked being genuine and i felt the crew was somewhat irked. the service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. we waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. the ""onboard chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. he would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. the whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. the food was served and it was beautifully plated. i can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier i've flown in business class. the onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and i could not really see how he was a chef. he took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. i think that is the extent of it and i don't really see any exotic or added value to this.during the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. i have flown many carriers in business class and i have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. the crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. i also experienced the turkish airlines lounge in istanbul during my connection. it is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. i qualified for the use of a resting suite. the attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when i could shower. i was there 3 hours, and she never came.",Business Class,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,False,1428,Business,Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul,February 2019,A330 / A321,1.0,2.0,Turkish Airlines,Turkey,True

2019-12-20,Mistreatment by turkish airlines,1.0,"i'm writing this review in my room in yotel air (hotel) inside istanbul airport after having been denied my right to board a flight to berlin with turkish airlines by a member of their staff earlier today (12:30 pm, december 19, 2019). i had to book a room in this hotel for an overnight stay and buy a new ticket for the earliest flight to berlin tomorrow (december 20, 2019) without any compensation from turkish airlines. all this was due to the fact that said staff had no knowledge of schengen visa regulations involving non-eu nationals/passports. i am devastated by this mistreatment by turkish airlines. i was supposed to fly with turkish airlines from istanbul to berlin at 12:30 pm earlier today (december 19, 2019), but i was denied boarding by a ground staff member who was in charge of checking passengers' passports and boarding passes at the gate because he assumed that i did not have a visa/permit to enter germany. i explained very clearly in simple english that i did not require a visa to enter germany and the schengen area for tourism purposes for up to 90 days, as my country is included in one of the non-eu countries to which the visa requirement does not apply (for tourism purposes). he dismissed my claim (which i understand, given the priority for security) and went on to make calls and texts to verify my claim. in the meantime, he made me wait on the side while he attended to all the other passengers who were entering the gate. because there was no conclusive answer from the other side of the phone, he and his team decided to let the plane leave without me. not long after the plane had left, he finally got a confirmation from ""germany border controls"" that my claim that i did not need a visa for visiting germany was correct. then, he took me to a turkish airlines booth (airside) to get me rebooked on another flight. after exchanging a few sentences with the turkish airlines ticketing team, he left there unattended. he did not say sorry to me. after waiting for four hours for a confirmation from the ticketing team about my next flight, they said to me that i would need to buy a new ticket because my original ticket was a ""promotional"" ticket. i defended myself saying that i did not miss my flight. rather, i was denied boarding because one of their ground staff members assumed that i needed a visa permit and did not have one. i rang turkish airlines's customer service to get help and explained the whole situation via phone and then email. after two hours, they responded to my email say they could not compensate me and even defended said staff for denying me my right to board the plane in the interest of protecting all turkish airlines's customers and passengers (was i not a customer?). what broke my heart was the turkish airlines team being adamant that it was somehow my mistake - they mentioned ""incomplete documents"", ""invalid visa"" etc. but i never needed a visa in the first place. finally, i had no choice but to buy another ticket for a flight the next morning and book a room at the hotel inside the airport. all this without so much as ""sorry"", let alone compensation. i'm now very apprehensive about going to europe via istanbul. i've been traveling to europe since i was 18. i have never been denied boarding until now. i have gone to berlin from my country in asia twice within the last 12 months - once via dubai and the other amsterdam. zero problem.",Economy Class,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,1.0,False,1672,Solo Leisure,Istanbul to Berlin,January 2019,Not informed,1.0,-1.0,Turkish Airlines,Turkey,False
