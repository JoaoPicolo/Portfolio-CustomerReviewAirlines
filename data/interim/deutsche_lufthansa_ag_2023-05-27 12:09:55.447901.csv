2017-01-24,Staff very friendly and attentive,7,"we flew lufthansa business class from munich to barcelona on january 8, 2017. our flight was supposed to leave from munich's new terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the star alliance schengen business lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). munich right now is going through a phase of siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didn´t make it to the airport on time"". funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. during that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasn´t forthcoming. boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off terminal 1 which lh doesn´t even use. our a320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. in fact we didn´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. the flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. the lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on european flights is worth the money in my opinion even if lh european business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. but the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. the staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean. flight announcements were sufficient and comprehensible and came in four languages. all in all, i would recommend flying lh business class on european routes, and i would recommend that lh improve their ground services in muc.",Business Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,True,928,A321,Family Leisure,Munich to Barcelona,January 2017,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,False

2017-10-17,Experience was frustrating,2,"athens to vancouver via munich. despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from munich to vancouver, our experience was frustrating, flat out disappointing. we could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online, your name, ticket number etc may be incorrect, and your routing does not match your ticket. error messages were different every time we tried so you didn’t know what exactly was the reason. we were questioning whether he even had a ticket. called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 24/7. we had to wait. tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly int’l roaming charges for calls. original gate from ath-mun was rather close to our mun-yvr, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. on arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight. boarding an a330 mun-yvr was a disaster. other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. if you’re a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it. safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go. upon arrival into yvr, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in mun and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. they were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. total 40hrs. we wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from lufthansa. it has been 7 days and still no response.",Premium Economy,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,False,1075,A330 / A320,Family Leisure,Athens to Vancouver via Munich,October 2017,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,False

2018-02-17,Leaves a lot to be desired for,8,"whilst i am very proud that lufthansa has become the first european airline to be awarded 5 stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. traveling every week on the same route (to and from milan) from frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal a part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. arriving into frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. so, for instance landing on the relatively new runway west, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? that adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from milan! crazy. frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with ipads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. but the worst part is how lufthansa and frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of hons and first class passengers). long waiting times at security and in the schengen area in terminal a there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. schengen departures in terminal b have no lounge access whatsoever. guests in the three lounges (2 business, one senator/star alliance gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. all this leaves regular lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub munich (2 business lounges and a total of 4 senator lounges/areas). in their london, munich and hopefully soon malpensa lounge, lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, frankfurt. so what is it, that is the cause of this difference? maybe all lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,Not informed,1,True,1145,Not informed,Business,Frankfurt to Milan,February 2018,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

2018-06-12,Turned out to be a nightmare,1,"this is my 3rd bad experience with lufthansa in the last 3 months and i think i need to share it. i was travelling business class from zagreb to frankfurt and then to london with a layover in fra of 1hr 45min. boarding at zag was done without priority boarding. when landing at fra the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. not only no separate bus was used for c class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. when i reached terminal a i had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates b where my flight for lhr was departing from. i have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within europe, yet lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. the queue for the security was one of the longest i have ever seen in my life. as a business class passenger and star alliance gold member i attempted to enter the fast track. a lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""no"", despite me showing her my c class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. i asked her three times whether lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""no"". i waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. when i reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. the lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. there are not a lot of benefits for business class european flights. people pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. what should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. i have experienced inconsistent and bad service from lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that i would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.",Business Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,Not informed,1,False,1211,CRJ1000 / A320,Business,Zagreb to London via Frankfurt,June 2018,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

2018-11-26,Isn't worth the money we spent,7,"san francisco to munich. first time my son and i decided to try flying in premium economy as we were flying with lufthansa. in short, it isn't worth the money we spent. it was more comfortable than flying in economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. differences between economy and pe are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. the kit has 'cerruti 1861' on it not lufthansa and was just okay. they serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which i think should be varied. the drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. british airways and air france serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. the service was fine. we had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. food was tasty. however, there are just two choices: meat dish or pasta. and the portions are as small as a frozen meal. everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. the flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. however, the choices were either crackers, lindt chocolates, and juices and water. seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. i found it problematic to recline. in fact, i could not figure out how to do so. and the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. if i weren't sitting next to my son i'd need to ask my seat mate if i could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire pe section and they were filthy. plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. in fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. i've flown british airways and air france which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. this was a connecting flight between munich and rome. hated that we were not told that upon arrival in rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. it was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. all in all, i'd have to think hard if i want to spend another $2k for lufthansa's pe in future. i just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in economy. in fact, they make it known that you're really in economy as you have no special boarding privileges either; you enter with all of the economy passengers.",Premium Economy,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,True,1336,A380-800,Family Leisure,San Francisco to Munich,November 2018,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,False

2019-02-19,Boarding was a total mess,5,"miami to munich. how lufthansa is a 5 star airline has always baffled me but this time i really got the confirmation. i will not blame them for the 3 hours we spent on the plane before departing on our outwards trip (muc-mia), there was heavy snowfall in munchen and we had to wait for the runways to be cleared and the plane to be deiced. however, during those 3 hours there was no service at all. i wasn't expecting much, but a glass of water would have been nice though. now, the a380s cabin is seriously outdated. and even though it's clear that the plane we flew on recently underwent a c-check, being repainted in the new livery, the didn't bother retrofitting the cabin, so you get a 10 year old in-flight entertainment system. the touch screen barely works, it's slow to respond and responds only to every 3rd of 4th command. and on the inbound leg (mia-muc) the control keys (volume, channel, reading lights) didn't work at all. the ife also froze and reset several times. on the outbound flight some passengers had the ife not working at all and although they announced on the pa systems that they reset it several times, it didn't solve the problem. we also landed with the cabin light on (they should have been turned down) due to the same electrical problem. the seats are quite uncomfortable and the pitch in economy is just bearable and there are large metal containers protruding in the leg area. i have flown on low cost airlines which had the same seat pitch. there were no amenity kits provided, which if i'm not mistaken, should be provided by a 5 star airline, even in economy (i have flown on ones that do). the food is also nothing to brag about, it's half decent but certainly expected more from such a prestigious airline. on our backward trip the crew arrived late (but again, not their fault since there was an accident and a traffic jam), however the boarding process was a total mess. people aligned according to their seat numbers, but then they decided to randomly close lanes and just board people wherever. there wasn't even a boarding announcement, just for first and business class. when they started boarding economy and economy premium they just opened two random lanes. this meant that no one really knew what's going on and the random boarding made the boarding time unnecessarily long for such a large plane (people in the back which should have been first ended up waiting for people in the front to sit down, who should have been boarded last). the crew however is pleasant, smiles and does a good job. the pilots also seemed professional and seemed to have everything under control, despite quite rough turbulence at times. at least this time our bags arrived safe, this is a miracle for lufthansa since they managed to break 2 trolleys on my previous flights. in conclusion, definitely not a 5 star airline and regret choosing them over the other 5 star airline with which i could have flown (despite the fact that my flight time to mia would have been an hour longer since they operate from a different hub and would have had other connecting flights).",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,False,1381,A380-800,Couple Leisure,Miami to Munich,February 2019,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

2019-10-10,Senator lounge is in free fall,6,"i flew from berlin to tivat via frankfurt on 6 october in business class. the senator lounge in berlin is in free fall. there was a lot of talk about the new senator lounge. in the end, the new one is worse than the old one. the choice of food and drinks is very limited. for breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. the croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. there is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. shame on lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the german capital. the departure from berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. however, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. as i was in a good position overlooking the apron, i knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in frankfurt. the aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. in business class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. for me, there was enough connecting time in frankfurt, as i knew exactly how i could get from terminal 1 to terminal 2 quickly. i spent some 20 minutes in the senator lounge. it was quite empty for that time of day. the food served reflected the fact that the oktoberfest in munich had started. it was all very bavarian – the same you get in the munich lounges all year round. within the 50 minutes i was in frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from b30 to b20 to b27 and finally to b28. the flight from frankfurt to tivat was the real disappointment. the flight was more than twice as long as the inner-german flight from berlin to frankfurt, but the food served on board to tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. i mean how is this possible? how can it be that lufthansa – a so-called 5-star airline – offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? frankfurt is lufthansa‘s main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. is that the impression lufthansa tries to leave? austrian, a lufthansa-group member, is able to serve a hot meal on all international flights no matter how long it is. why is the parent company, lufthansa, not able (or willing?) to do the same?",Business Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,Not informed,1,True,1551,A320/A319,Couple Leisure,Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt,October 2019,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

(but my car is parked at jfk long term parking). then we have to go to another gate (z12) to the counter in order to rebook our flight. anyway, so i took that flight at 1:20pm (again they put me in regular economy while i paid for premium economy). because of the whole chaos that lufthansa put me through now i end up in newark. so i have to figure out an uber home or arrange pick up by friends while i have my own car parked at jfk where i booked my final destination to. lufthansa, are you paying my one extra day of long term parking? are you going to refund me the cost difference between premium economy to regular economy?",Premium Economy,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,False,1742,Not informed,Solo Leisure,Brussels to Newark via Frankfurt,July 2021,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

2021-09-17,My daughter was denied boarding,1,"my daughter was denied boarding.  the adventure began already in the night before the flight when i tried to check-in my daughter electronically. this was not successful, because electronic check-in of lh asks whether or not a visa is available. in an exchange program, there is no visa, however, but an ""application approval"" and the visa is issued at the local airport upon arrival. such a possibility is, unfortunately, not available within the electronic check-in at lh and electronic check-in could, therefore, not be performed. we arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. as soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. however, only an electronic check-in was possible there. this check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. after a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. when she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines i have experience with close their gates just before departure, lh refused to accept my daughter. lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also lh has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of lh. all in all, i consider this procedure unacceptable. two days before departure, i wanted to clarify one more point with lh and called lh's information desk at 23:00. according to the information on lh´s website, the support line is open until midnight. the announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. since the clarification was important to me, i decided to wait. after waiting until 23.50, i hung up. i think that this example about the customer orientation on the part of lh is meaningful enough and no further comments are needed.",Premium Economy,Not informed,Not informed,Not informed,Not informed,1,False,1767,Not informed,Family Leisure,Frankfurt to Vancouver,August 2021,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

2022-07-19,Truly miserable flight experience,2,"wife and i traveled from basel to salt lake city with connection in frankfurt. flew crj 900 from basel to frankfurt. seated in front of exit row. no window and no recline seat. good thing it was only a 1 hour flight. frankfurt airport was horrid. bussed us from remote pad to a terminal. then had to walk 3/4 mile through a to c terminal, but required to exit secure zone when left terminal a. there was two separate b terminal security lines which were at least 200 yards long. figured lots of people would miss flights in that terminal the line for c terminal security took around 45 minutes. although we had a connection time of 1.5 hours we barely made it through security to the c15 gate in time. when going through the boarding ticket scan i was told i had to pay for baggage which i had already paid on check in at basel. gate agent had no record of us paying for baggage which would have cost us another $100. i finally reasoned with gate agent that we had already checked bags in basel and paid the fee in basel so they finally waived the extra baggage fee. we boarded the plane exhausted and dehydrated from the walk. after walking as fast as we could from a to c, we did not have time to purchase any water because it would be discarded at security in c terminal. we were thinking we would get a bottle of water on the plane. sat on ground after boarding for another 1/2 hour. no beverage service for at least 30 minutes after take off. no bottle of water, only a half full 6 oz plastic cup. and no ice. servers skipped us twice during flight and only offered drink service 30 minutes after takeoff, during the meal two hours into flight and two additional times before the ""snack"" during the 11 hour flight. the snack before landing was two pieces of bread and a slice of white cheese. i had to ask the servers for some water twice after being skipped. seats and legroom seemed smaller than those on delta. delta has 4 times as many entertainment selections. arrived in salt lake city feeling dehydrated the entire flight. overall a truly miserable flight experience. i will never go through frankfort again if i can avoid it and will avoid lufthansa at all costs.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,False,1969,A380,Couple Leisure,Basel to Salt Lake City via Frankfurt,July 2022,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

2022-09-24,No desire to travel again with lufthansa,2,"not a good experience all round with lufthansa. i thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of star alliance. first, the positives. they automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in frankfurt. also our baggage did not get lost. so they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. so, what went wrong? inconveniently, there was not a single member of lufthansa staff available at the airport in munich. thankfully we had downloaded the lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or sms communication. eu passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. however, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". we took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to frankfurt departed. having to spend a night in munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. the food that lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into munich. all the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. the designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. there were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. the next morning we boarded our new flight to frankfurt at 6am. on arrival, i searched out the lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. they did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for muscat, so that meant spending an extra €17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. no further dramas onward to muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. it has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law. the only communication we've had was an email telling us to confirm our new itinerary (sent 2 days after we arrived) and an automated email in response to my complaint, which asked me to submit my flight details (which i had already done 3 times by this point). this experience is in stark contrast to a previous experience with klm, travelling to dubai via amsterdam, where we were given the compensation in cash at the service desk, and there was a driver waiting outside to take us to a hotel for the night. we have no desire to travel again with lufthansa.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,False,2054,A320,Family Leisure,Manchester to Muscat via Munich,August 2022,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

(around row 40) when we arrived at the departure lounge at munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. the lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. the clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. the suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. after some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. when we got on board, i got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that i had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. i hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. when i got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what i thought was mine or my wife's seat. a short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. the seats my wife and i endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. the seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. there was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. we noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to singapore. singapore airlines from singapore to brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. we had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. so, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. we received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. my wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. when we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat. the parents did their best but the crying and continuous getting up and down to silence the baby made sleep impossible for anyone nearby. cabin staff were noticeably absent in assisting the parents. avoid lufthansa at all costs in future.",Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,False,2066,A359,Couple Leisure,Dusseldorf to Singapore via Munich,October 2022,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True

2023-05-26,They have practised cost cutting,2,"lufthansa used to be a very good airline but in recent years they have practised cost cutting to a level that impacted customer experience, food and service quality and is simply not acceptable anymore for a flag carrier. i had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so lufthansa flights. there seem to be barely any lh flights that leave and arrive on time. in the last week, i took five lh flights and every single one of them was delayed. at this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. so, we finally took off 40 mins late. i specifically booked a seat in the first row because i have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that lh changed my seat and i was bumped back a few rows. as there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more “important” than i which is not a good feeling. (i would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) so much about recognising loyalty which doesn’t seem to have a significant role in lufthansa’s playbook anymore. food portions were so small that i thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. over the last years the food at lh got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. the food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). being german myself, i do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but i just don’t see why people of cultural backgrounds other the german would eat this. i suppose the food in business was not worth more than about 3 euros. there is no free food or drink service in economy at all, the only thing lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). so, here’s the “verdict”: with lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. there is no free food or drink service in exonomy class loyalty recognition is non-existent. food is terrible and comes in “appetiser” portions only. i can’t see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)",Business Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,Not informed,1,False,2220,A321-200,Business,Munich to Catania,May 2023,1.0,Not informed,Deutsche Lufthansa AG,Germany,True
